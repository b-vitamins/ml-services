 abstract = {Factor analysis aims to determine latent factors, or traits, which summarize a given data set. Inter-battery factor analysis extends this notion to multiple views of the data. In this paper we show how a nonlinear, nonparametric version of these models can be recovered through the Gaussian process latent variable model. This gives us a flexible formalism for multi-view learning where the latent variables can be used both for exploratory purposes and for learning representations that enable efficient inference for ambiguous estimation tasks. Learning is performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong regularization during training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined efficiently and automatically. We demonstrate this by producing the first (to our knowledge) published results of learning from dozens of views, even when data is scarce. We further show experimental results on several different types of multi-view data sets and for different kinds of tasks, including exploratory data analysis, generation, ambiguity modelling through latent priors and classification.},

 abstract = {This work initiates a general study of learning and generalization without the i.i.d. assumption, starting from first principles. While the traditional approach to statistical learning theory typically relies on standard assumptions from probability theory (e.g., i.i.d. or stationary ergodic), in this work we are interested in developing a theory of learning based only on the most fundamental and necessary assumptions implicit in the requirements of the learning problem itself. We specifically study universally consistent function learning, where the objective is to obtain low long-run average loss for any target function, when the data follow a given stochastic process. We are then interested in the question of whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be universally consistent given only the assumption that universally consistent learning is possible for the given data process. The reasoning that motivates this criterion emanates from a kind of optimist's decision theory, and so we refer to such learning rules as being optimistically universal. We study this question in three natural learning settings: inductive, self-adaptive, and online. Remarkably, as our strongest positive result, we find that optimistically universal learning rules do indeed exist in the self-adaptive learning setting. Establishing this fact requires us to develop new approaches to the design of learning algorithms. Along the way, we also identify concise characterizations of the family of processes under which universally consistent learning is possible in the inductive and self-adaptive settings. We additionally pose a number of enticing open problems, particularly for the online learning setting.},

 abstract = {In the problem of domain generalization (DG), there are labeled training data sets from several related prediction problems, and the goal is to make accurate predictions on future unlabeled data sets that are not known to the learner. This problem arises in several applications where data distributions fluctuate because of environmental, technical, or other sources of variation. We introduce a formal framework for DG, and argue that it can be viewed as a kind of supervised learning problem by augmenting the original feature space with the marginal distribution of feature vectors. While our framework has several connections to conventional analysis of supervised learning algorithms, several unique aspects of DG require new methods of analysis. This work lays the learning theoretic foundations of domain generalization, building on our earlier conference paper where the problem of DG was introduced (Blanchard et al., 2011). We present two formal models of data generation, corresponding notions of risk, and distribution-free generalization error analysis. By focusing our attention on kernel methods, we also provide more quantitative results and a universally consistent algorithm. An efficient implementation is provided for this algorithm, which is experimentally compared to a pooling strategy on one synthetic and three real-world data sets.},

 abstract = {In retail, there are predictable yet dramatic time-dependent patterns in customer behavior, such as periodic changes in the number of visitors, or increases in customers just before major holidays. The current paradigm of multi-armed bandit analysis does not take these known patterns into account. This means that for applications in retail, where prices are fixed for periods of time, current bandit algorithms will not suffice. This work provides a remedy that takes the time-dependent patterns into account, and we show how this remedy is implemented for the UCB, $\varepsilon$-greedy, and UCB-L algorithms, and also through a new policy called the variable arm pool algorithm. In the corrected methods, exploitation (greed) is regulated over time, so that more exploitation occurs during higher reward periods, and more exploration occurs in periods of low reward. In order to understand why regret is reduced with the corrected methods, we present a set of bounds that provide insight into why we would want to exploit during periods of high reward, and discuss the impact on regret. Our proposed methods perform well in experiments, and were inspired by a high-scoring entry in the Exploration and Exploitation 3 contest using data from Yahoo$!$ Front Page. That entry heavily used time-series methods to regulate greed over time, which was substantially more effective than other contextual bandit methods.},

Additionally, we show that under a randomized model for $\mathbf{p}$ and $\mathbf{q}$, a suitable number of binary paired comparisons yield a stable embedding of the space of target vectors.

We work with adversarial training methods based on IPMs and derive a novel risk bound, which upper bounds the risk between the learned mapping $h$ and the target mapping $y$, by a sum of three terms: (i) the risk between $h$ and the most distant alternative mapping that was learned by the same cross-domain mapping algorithm, (ii) the minimal discrepancy between the target domain and the domain obtained by applying a hypothesis $h^*$ on the samples of the source domain, where $h^*$ is a hypothesis selectable by the same algorithm. The bound is directly related to Occam's razor and encourages the selection of the minimal architecture that supports a small mapping discrepancy and (iii) an approximation error term that decreases as the complexity of the class of discriminators increases and is empirically shown to be small. 
The bound leads to multiple algorithmic consequences, including a method for hyperparameters selection and for early stopping in cross-domain mapping GANs. We also demonstrate a novel capability for unsupervised learning of estimating confidence in the mapping of every specific sample.},

Under this feature sampling framework, in recent years there has been a growing interest in estimating the sum of the probability masses pj's of features observed with frequency r≥0 in the sample, here denoted by Mn,r. This is the natural feature sampling counterpart of the classical problem of estimating small probabilities in the species sampling framework, where each individual is endowed with only one feature (or “species). In this paper we study the problem of consistent estimation of the small mass Mn,r. We first show that there do not exist universally consistent estimators, in the multiplicative sense, of the missing mass Mn,0. Then, we introduce an estimator of Mn,r and identify sufficient conditions under which the estimator is consistent. In particular, we propose a nonparametric estimator M^n,r of Mn,r which has the same analytic form of the celebrated Good--Turing estimator for small probabilities, with the sole difference that the two estimators have different ranges (supports). Then, we show that M^n,r is strongly consistent, in the multiplicative sense, under the assumption that (pj)j≥1 has regularly varying heavy tails.},

 abstract = {In machine learning, the notion of multi-armed bandits refers to a class of online learning problems, in which an agent is supposed to simultaneously explore and exploit a given set of choice alternatives in the course of a sequential decision process. In the standard setting, the agent learns from stochastic feedback in the form of real-valued rewards. In many applications, however, numerical reward signals are not readily available -- instead, only weaker information is provided, in particular relative preferences in the form of qualitative comparisons between pairs of alternatives. This observation has motivated the study of variants of the multi-armed bandit problem, in which more general representations are used both for the type of feedback to learn from and the target of prediction. The aim of this paper is to provide a survey of the state of the art in this field, referred to as preference-based multi-armed bandits or dueling bandits. To this end, we provide an overview of problems that have been considered in the literature as well as methods for tackling them. Our taxonomy is mainly based on the assumptions made by these methods about the data-generating process and, related to this, the properties of the preference-based feedback.},

Recently, the sum-of-norms (SON) model (also known as the clustering path) has been proposed in Pelckmans et al. (2005), Lindsten et al. (2011) and Hocking et al. (2011). The perfect recovery properties of the convex clustering model with uniformly weighted all pairwise-differences regularization have been proved by Zhu et al. (2014) and Panahi et al. (2017). However, no theoretical guarantee has been established for the general weighted convex clustering model, where better empirical results have been observed. In the numerical optimization aspect, although algorithms like the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA) have been proposed to solve the convex clustering model (Chi and Lange, 2015), it still remains very challenging to solve large-scale problems. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery guarantee of the general weighted convex clustering model, which include and improve existing theoretical results as special cases. In addition, we develop a semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method for solving large-scale convex clustering problems. Extensive numerical experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate that our algorithm is highly efficient and robust for solving large-scale problems. Moreover, the numerical results also show the superior performance and scalability of our algorithm comparing to the existing first-order methods. In particular, our algorithm is able to solve a convex clustering problem with 200,000 points in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in about 6 minutes.},

The channel law guarantees a local differential privacy of $\epsilon$. Subject to a prescribed privacy level $\epsilon$, the optimal channel should be designed such that an estimate of the source distribution based on the channel outputs $Y_1,\dotsc,Y_n$ converges as fast as possible to the exact value $\boldsymbol{p}$. For this purpose we study the convergence to zero of three distribution distance metrics: $f$-divergence, mean-squared error and total variation. We derive the respective normalized first-order terms of convergence (as $n\to\infty$), which for a given target privacy $\epsilon$ represent a rule-of-thumb factor by which the sample size must be augmented so as to achieve the same estimation accuracy as that of a non-randomizing channel. We formulate the privacy-fidelity trade-off problem as being that of minimizing said first-order term under a privacy constraint $\epsilon$. We further identify a scalar quantity that captures the essence of this trade-off, and prove bounds and data-processing inequalities on this quantity.

 abstract = {Signal estimation problems with smoothness and sparsity priors can be naturally modeled as quadratic optimization with $\ell_0$-"norm" constraints. Since such problems are non-convex and hard-to-solve, the standard approach is, instead, to tackle their convex surrogates based on $\ell_1$-norm relaxations. In this paper, we propose a new iterative (convex) conic quadratic relaxations that exploit not only the $\ell_0$-"norm" terms, but also the fitness and smoothness functions. The iterative convexification approach substantially closes the gap between the $\ell_0$-"norm" and its $\ell_1$ surrogate. These stronger relaxations lead to significantly better estimators than $\ell_1$-norm approaches and also allow one to utilize affine sparsity priors. In addition, the parameters of the model and the resulting estimators are easily interpretable. Experiments with a tailored Lagrangian decomposition method indicate that the proposed iterative convex relaxations \rev{yield solutions within 1\% of the exact $\ell_0$ approach, and can tackle instances with up to 100,000 variables under one minute.},

 abstract = {Effective feature representation is key to the predictive performance of any algorithm. This paper introduces a meta-procedure, called Non-Euclidean Upgrading (NEU), which learns feature maps that are expressive enough to embed the universal approximation property (UAP) into most model classes while only outputting feature maps that preserve any model class's UAP. We show that NEU can learn any feature map with these two properties if that feature map is asymptotically deformable into the identity. We also find that the feature-representations learned by NEU are always submanifolds of the feature space. NEU's properties are derived from a new deep neural model that is universal amongst all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms on the input space. We derive qualitative and quantitative approximation guarantees for this architecture. We quantify the number of parameters required for this new architecture to memorize any set of input-output pairs while simultaneously fixing every point of the input space lying outside some compact set, and we quantify the size of this set as a function of our model's depth. Moreover, we show that no deep feed-forward network with commonly used activation function has all these properties. NEU's performance is evaluated against competing machine learning methods on various regression and dimension reduction tasks both with financial and simulated data.},

We cast multidimensional unfolding into an estimation problem, where the respondent and item ideal points are treated as parameters to be estimated. An estimator is then proposed for the simultaneous estimation of these parameters. Asymptotic theory is provided for the recovery of the ideal points, shedding lights on the validity of model-based visualization. An alternating projected gradient descent algorithm is proposed for the parameter estimation.

We find that a recent method (Foster et al., 2018) using optimism under uncertainty works the best overall. A surprisingly close second is a simple greedy baseline that only explores implicitly through the diversity of contexts, followed by a variant of Online Cover (Agarwal et al., 2014) which tends to be more conservative but robust to problem specification by design. Along the way, we also evaluate various components of contextual bandit algorithm design such as loss estimators. Overall, this is a thorough study and review of contextual bandit methodology.},

In this paper we solve several shortcomings of this method, starting with the problem of predictions in regions with low data density. We experiment with the use of inducing points to provide a sparse approximation and show that these can provide robust differential privacy in outlier areas and at higher dimensions. We then look at classification, and modify the Laplace approximation approach to provide differentially private predictions. We then combine this with the sparse approximation and demonstrate the capability to perform classification in high dimensions. We finally explore the issue of hyperparameter selection and develop a method for their private selection.

 abstract = {Algorithms based on the hard thresholding principle have been well studied with sounding theoretical guarantees in the compressed sensing and more general sparsity-constrained optimization. It is widely observed in existing empirical studies that when a restricted Newton step was used (as the debiasing step), the hard-thresholding algorithms tend to meet halting conditions in a significantly low number of iterations and are very efficient. Hence, the thus obtained Newton hard-thresholding algorithms call for stronger theoretical guarantees than for their simple hard-thresholding counterparts. This paper provides a theoretical justification for the use of the restricted Newton step. We build our theory and algorithm, Newton Hard-Thresholding Pursuit (NHTP), for the sparsity-constrained optimization. Our main result shows that NHTP is quadratically convergent under the standard assumption of restricted strong convexity and smoothness. We also establish its global convergence to a stationary point under a weaker assumption. In the special case of the compressive sensing, NHTP effectively reduces to some of the existing hard-thresholding algorithms with a Newton step. Consequently, our fast convergence result justifies why those algorithms perform better than without the Newton step. The efficiency of NHTP was demonstrated on both synthetic and real data in compressed sensing and sparse logistic regression.},

 abstract = {Signal denoising-also known as non-parametric regression-is often performed through shrinkage estimation in a transformed (e.g., wavelet) domain; shrinkage in the transformed domain corresponds to smoothing in the original domain. A key question in such applications is how much to shrink, or, equivalently, how much to smooth. Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods provide an attractive solution to this problem; they use the data to estimate a distribution of underlying "effects," hence automatically select an appropriate amount of shrinkage. However, most existing implementations of empirical Bayes shrinkage are less flexible than they could be-both in their assumptions on the underlying distribution of effects, and in their ability to handle heteroskedasticity-which limits their signal denoising applications. Here we address this by adopting a particularly flexible, stable and computationally convenient empirical Bayes shrinkage method and applying it to several signal denoising problems. These applications include smoothing of Poisson data and heteroskedastic Gaussian data. We show through empirical comparisons that the results are competitive with other methods, including both simple thresholding rules and purpose-built empirical Bayes procedures. Our methods are implemented in the R package smashr, "SMoothing by Adaptive SHrinkage in R," available at https://www.github.com/stephenslab/smashr.},

 abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm for large-scale regression problems named histogram transform ensembles (HTE), composed of random rotations, stretchings, and translations. First of all, we investigate the theoretical properties of HTE when the regression function lies in the H\"{o}lder space $C^{k,\alpha}$, $k \in \mathbb{N}_0$, $\alpha \in (0,1]$. In the case that $k=0, 1$, we adopt the constant regressors and develop the na\"{i}ve histogram transforms (NHT). Within the space $C^{0,\alpha}$, although almost optimal convergence rates can be derived for both single and ensemble NHT, we fail to show the benefits of ensembles over single estimators theoretically. In contrast, in the subspace $C^{1,\alpha}$, we prove that if $d \geq 2(1+\alpha)/\alpha$, the lower bound of the convergence rates for single NHT turns out to be worse than the upper bound of the convergence rates for ensemble NHT. In the other case when $k \geq 2$, the NHT may no longer be appropriate in predicting smoother regression functions. Instead, we apply kernel histogram transforms (KHT) equipped with smoother regressors such as support vector machines (SVMs), and it turns out that both single and ensemble KHT enjoy almost optimal convergence rates. Then we validate the above theoretical results by numerical experiments. On the one hand, simulations are conducted to elucidate that ensemble NHT outperform single NHT. On the other hand, the effects of bin sizes on accuracy of both NHT and KHT also accord with theoretical analysis. Last but not least, in the real-data experiments, comparisons between the ensemble KHT, equipped with adaptive histogram transforms, and other state-of-the-art large-scale regression estimators verify the effectiveness and accuracy of our algorithm.},

 abstract = {In mixed multi-view data, multiple sets of diverse features are measured on the same set of samples. By integrating all available data sources, we seek to discover common group structure among the samples that may be hidden in individualistic cluster analyses of a single data view. While several techniques for such integrative clustering have been explored, we propose and develop a convex formalization that enjoys strong empirical performance and inherits the mathematical properties of increasingly popular convex clustering methods. Specifically, our Integrative Generalized Convex Clustering Optimization (iGecco) method employs different convex distances, losses, or divergences for each of the different data views with a joint convex fusion penalty that leads to common groups. Additionally, integrating mixed multi-view data is often challenging when each data source is high-dimensional. To perform feature selection in such scenarios, we develop an adaptive shifted group-lasso penalty that selects features by shrinking them towards their loss-specific centers. Our so-called iGecco+ approach selects features from each data view that are best for determining the groups, often leading to improved integrative clustering. To solve our problem, we develop a new type of generalized multi-block ADMM algorithm using sub-problem approximations that more efficiently fits our model for big data sets. Through a series of numerical experiments and real data examples on text mining and genomics, we show that iGecco+ achieves superior empirical performance for high-dimensional mixed multi-view data.},

We illustrate a problem with current DRL formulations, which rely on an overly broad definition of allowed distributions for the adversary, leading to learned classifiers that are unable to predict with any confidence. We propose a solution that incorporates unlabeled data into the DRL problem to further constrain the adversary. We show that this new formulation is tractable for stochastic gradient-based optimization and yields a computable guarantee on the future performance of the learned classifier, analogous to -- but tighter than -- guarantees from conventional DRL. We examine the performance of this new formulation on 14 real datasets and find that it often yields effective classifiers with nontrivial performance guarantees in situations where conventional DRL produces neither. Inspired by these results, we extend our DRL formulation to active learning with a novel, distributionally-robust version of the standard model-change heuristic. Our active learning algorithm often achieves superior learning performance to the original heuristic on real datasets.},

We investigate the impact of communication constraint, $B$, on the expected error and derive a tight lower bound on the error achievable by any algorithm. We then propose an estimator, which we call Multi-Resolution Estimator (MRE), whose expected error (when $B\ge\log mn$) meets the aforementioned lower bound up to poly-logarithmic factors, and is thereby order optimal. We also address the problem of learning under tiny communication budget, and present lower and upper error bounds when $B$ is a constant. The expected error of MRE, unlike existing algorithms, tends to zero as the number of machines ($m$) goes to infinity, even when the number of samples per machine ($n$) remains upper bounded by a constant.

Despite their usefulness, MIP-based global optimization approaches are significantly slower compared to the relatively mature algorithms for $\ell_1$-regularization and heuristics for nonconvex regularized problems. We aim to bridge this gap in computation times by developing new MIP-based algorithms for $\ell_0$-regularized classification. We propose two classes of scalable algorithms: an exact algorithm that can handle $p\approx 50,000$ features in a few minutes, and approximate algorithms that can address instances with $p\approx 10^6$ in times comparable to the fast $\ell_1$-based algorithms. Our exact algorithm is based on the novel idea of \textsl{integrality generation}, which solves the original problem (with $p$ binary variables) via a sequence of mixed integer programs that involve a small number of binary variables. Our approximate algorithms are based on coordinate descent and local combinatorial search. In addition, we present new estimation error bounds for a class of $\ell_0$-regularized estimators.

While much work has been done in the linear regression setting, there is lack of literature on inference for high dimensional generalized linear models. We propose a novel and computationally feasible method, which accommodates a variety of outcome types, including normal, binomial, and Poisson data. We use a "splitting and smoothing" approach, which splits samples into two parts, performs variable selection using one part and conducts partial regression with the other part. Averaging the estimates over multiple random splits, we obtain the smoothed estimates, which are numerically stable. We show that the estimates are consistent, asymptotically normal, and construct confidence intervals with proper coverage probabilities for all predictors.

In the absence of noise, predictive learning on Ising models was recently studied by Bresler and Karzand (2020); this paper quantifies how noise in the hidden model impacts the tasks of structure recovery and marginal distribution estimation by proving upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity. Our results generalize state-of-the-art bounds reported in prior work, and they exactly recover the noiseless case ($q=0$). In fact, for any tree with $p$ vertices and probability of incorrect recovery $\delta>0$, the sufficient number of samples remains logarithmic as in the noiseless case, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(\log(p/\delta))$, while the dependence on $q$ is $\mathcal{O}\big( 1/(1-2q)^{4} \big)$, for both aforementioned tasks.

 abstract = {Interpretable machine learning has become a strong competitor for traditional black-box models. However, the possible loss of the predictive performance for gaining interpretability is often inevitable, putting practitioners in a dilemma of choosing between high accuracy (black-box models) and interpretability (interpretable models). In this work, we propose a novel framework for building a Hybrid Predictive Model (HPM) that integrates an interpretable model with any black-box model to combine their strengths. The interpretable model substitutes the black-box model on a subset of data where the black-box is overkill or nearly overkill, gaining transparency at no or low cost of the predictive accuracy. We design a principled objective function that considers predictive accuracy, model interpretability, and model transparency (defined as the percentage of data processed by the interpretable substitute.) Under this framework, we propose two hybrid models, one substituting with association rules and the other with linear models, and we design customized training algorithms for both models. We test the hybrid models on structured data and text data where interpretable models collaborate with various state-of-the-art black-box models. Results show that hybrid models obtain an efficient trade-off between transparency and predictive performance, characterized by our proposed efficient frontiers.},

 abstract = {Stratified models are models that depend in an arbitrary way on a set of selected categorical features, and depend linearly on the other features. In a basic and traditional formulation a separate model is fit for each value of the categorical feature, using only the data that has the specific categorical value. To this formulation we add Laplacian regularization, which encourages the model parameters for neighboring categorical values to be similar. Laplacian regularization allows us to specify one or more weighted graphs on the stratification feature values. For example, stratifying over the days of the week, we can specify that the Sunday model parameter should be close to the Saturday and Monday model parameters. The regularization improves the performance of the model over the traditional stratified model, since the model for each value of the categorical `borrows strength' from its neighbors. In particular, it produces a model even for categorical values that did not appear in the training data set. 
We propose an efficient distributed method for fitting stratified models, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). When the fitting loss functions are convex, the stratified model fitting problem is convex, and our method computes the global minimizer of the loss plus regularization; in other cases it computes a local minimizer. The method is very efficient, and naturally scales to large data sets or numbers of stratified feature values. We illustrate our method with a variety of examples.},

 abstract = {Efficient explorative data analysis systems must take into account both what a user knows and wants to know. This paper proposes a principled framework for interactive visual exploration of relations in data, through views most informative given the user's current knowledge and objectives. The user can input pre-existing knowledge of relations in the data and also formulate specific exploration interests, which are then taken into account in the exploration. The idea is to steer the exploration process towards the interests of the user, instead of showing uninteresting or already known relations. The user's knowledge is modelled by a distribution over data sets parametrised by subsets of rows and columns of data, called tile constraints. We provide a computationally efficient implementation of this concept based on constrained randomisation. Furthermore, we describe a novel dimensionality reduction method for finding the views most informative to the user, which at the limit of no background knowledge and with generic objectives reduces to PCA. We show that the method is suitable for interactive use and is robust to noise, outperforms standard projection pursuit visualisation methods, and gives understandable and useful results in analysis of real-world data. We provide an open-source implementation of the framework.},

 abstract = {This work describes simple and efficient algorithms for interactively learning non-binary concepts in the learning from random counter-examples (LRC) model. Here, learning takes place from random counter-examples that the learner receives in response to their proper equivalence queries. In this context, the learning time is defined as the number of counter-examples needed by the learner to identify the target concept. Such learning is particularly suited for online ranking, classification, clustering, etc., where machine learning models must be used before they are fully trained. We provide two simple LRC algorithms, deterministic and randomized, for exactly learning non-binary target concepts for any concept class $H$. We show that both of these algorithms have an $\mathcal{O}(\log{}|H|)$ asymptotically optimal average learning time. This solves an open problem on the existence of an efficient LRC randomized algorithm while simplifying and generalizing previous results. We also show that the expected learning time of any arbitrary LRC algorithm can be upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}ε\log{\frac{|H|}δ})$, where $ε$ and $δ$ are the allowed learning error and failure probability respectively. This shows that LRC interactive learning is at least as efficient as non-interactive Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. Our simulations show that in practice, these algorithms outperform their theoretical bounds.},

We propose a novel stochastic proximal algorithm for AUC maximization which is scalable to large scale streaming data. Our algorithm can accommodate general penalty terms and is easy to implement with favorable $O(d)$ space and per-iteration time complexities. We establish a high-probability convergence rate $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for the general convex setting, and improve it to a fast convergence rate $O(1/T)$ for the cases of strongly convex regularizers and no regularization term (without strong convexity). Our proof does not need the uniform boundedness assumption on the loss function or the iterates which is more fidelity to the practice. Finally, we perform extensive experiments over various benchmark data sets from real-world application domains which show the superior performance of our algorithm over the existing AUC maximization algorithms.},

 abstract = {Gradient descent-based optimization methods underpin the parameter training of neural networks, and hence comprise a significant component in the impressive test results found in a number of applications. Introducing stochasticity is key to their success in practical problems, and there is some understanding of the role of stochastic gradient descent in this context. Momentum modifications of gradient descent such as Polyak's Heavy Ball method (HB) and Nesterov's method of accelerated gradients (NAG), are also widely adopted. In this work our focus is on understanding the role of momentum in the training of neural networks, concentrating on the common situation in which the momentum contribution is fixed at each step of the algorithm. To expose the ideas simply we work in the deterministic setting. 
Our approach is to derive continuous time approximations of the discrete algorithms; these continuous time approximations provide insights into the mechanisms at play within the discrete algorithms. We prove three such approximations. Firstly we show that standard implementations of fixed momentum methods approximate a time-rescaled gradient descent flow, asymptotically as the learning rate shrinks to zero; this result does not distinguish momentum methods from pure gradient descent, in the limit of vanishing learning rate. We then proceed to prove two results aimed at understanding the observed practical advantages of fixed momentum methods over gradient descent. We achieve this by proving approximations to continuous time limits in which the small but fixed learning rate appears as a parameter. Furthermore in a third result we show that the momentum methods admit an exponentially attractive invariant manifold on which the dynamics reduces, approximately, to a gradient flow with respect to a modified loss function.},

Algorithmically, we consider two regularized regression models with bivariate forms in this space, including kernel ridge regression (KRR) and support vector regression (SVR) endowed with hyper-RKHS, and further combine divide-and-conquer with Nystr\"{o}m approximation for scalability in large sample cases. This framework is general: the underlying kernel is learned from a broad class, and can be positive definite or not, which adapts to various requirements in kernel learning. Theoretically, we study the convergence behavior of regularized regression algorithms in hyper-RKHS and derive the learning rates, which goes beyond the classical analysis on RKHS due to the non-trivial independence of pairwise samples and the characterisation of hyper-RKHS. Experimentally, results on several benchmarks suggest that the employed framework is able to learn a general kernel function form an arbitrary similarity matrix, and thus achieves a satisfactory performance on classification tasks.},

 abstract = {Bayesian inference in the presence of an intractable likelihood function is computationally challenging. When following a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to approximate the posterior distribution in this context, one typically either uses MCMC schemes which target the joint posterior of the parameters and some auxiliary latent variables, or pseudo-marginal Metropolis--Hastings (MH) schemes. The latter mimic a MH algorithm targeting the marginal posterior of the parameters by approximating unbiasedly the intractable likelihood. However, in scenarios where the parameters and auxiliary variables are strongly correlated under the posterior and/or this posterior is multimodal, Gibbs sampling or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) will perform poorly and the pseudo-marginal MH algorithm, as any other MH scheme, will be inefficient for high dimensional parameters. We propose here an original MCMC algorithm, termed pseudo-marginal HMC, which combines the advantages of both HMC and pseudo-marginal schemes. Specifically, the pseudo-marginal HMC method is controlled by a precision parameter N, controlling the approximation of the likelihood and, for any N, it samples the marginal posterior of the parameters. Additionally, as N tends to infinity, its sample trajectories and acceptance probability converge to those of an ideal, but intractable, HMC algorithm which would have access to the marginal posterior of parameters and its gradient. We demonstrate through experiments that pseudo-marginal HMC can outperform significantly both standard HMC and pseudo-marginal MH schemes.},

In this paper, we study multiple change-point localization in the high-dimensional regression setting, which is particularly challenging as no direct observations of the parameter of interest is available. Specifically, we assume we observe $\{ x_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^n$ where $ \{ x_t\}_{t=1}^n $ are $p$-dimensional covariates, $\{y_t\}_{t=1}^n$ are the univariate responses satisfying $\mathbb{E}(y_t) = x_t^\top \beta_t^* \text{ for } 1\le t \le n $ and $\{\beta_t^*\}_{t=1}^n $ are the unobserved regression coefficients that change over time in a piecewise constant manner. We propose a novel projection-based algorithm, Variance Projected Wild Binary Segmentation~(VPWBS), which transforms the original (difficult) problem of change-point detection in $p$-dimensional regression to a simpler problem of change-point detection in mean of a one-dimensional time series. VPWBS is shown to achieve sharp localization rate $O_p(1/n)$ up to a log factor, a significant improvement from the best rate $O_p(1/\sqrt{n})$ known in the existing literature for multiple change-point localization in high-dimensional regression. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the robust and favorable performance of VPWBS over two state-of-the-art algorithms, especially when the size of change in the regression coefficients $\{\beta_t^*\}_{t=1}^n $ is small.},

 abstract = {The development of models and methodology for the analysis of data from multiple heterogeneous networks is of importance both in statistical network theory and across a wide spectrum of application domains. Although single-graph analysis is well-studied, multiple graph inference is largely unexplored, in part because of the challenges inherent in appropriately modeling graph differences and yet retaining sufficient model simplicity to render estimation feasible. This paper addresses exactly this gap, by introducing a new model, the common subspace independent-edge multiple random graph model, which describes a heterogeneous collection of networks with a shared latent structure on the vertices but potentially different connectivity patterns for each graph. The model encompasses many popular network representations, including the stochastic blockmodel. The model is both flexible enough to meaningfully account for important graph differences, and tractable enough to allow for accurate inference in multiple networks. In particular, a joint spectral embedding of adjacency matrices-the multiple adjacency spectral embedding-leads to simultaneous consistent estimation of underlying parameters for each graph. Under mild additional assumptions, the estimates satisfy asymptotic normality and yield improvements for graph eigenvalue estimation. In both simulated and real data, the model and the embedding can be deployed for a number of subsequent network inference tasks, including dimensionality reduction, classification, hypothesis testing, and community detection. Specifically, when the embedding is applied to a data set of connectomes constructed through diffusion magnetic resonance imaging, the result is an accurate classification of brain scans by human subject and a meaningful determination of heterogeneity across scans of different individuals.},

Despite recent progress, the reason for this outcome is not fully understood. Could deep networks have very few, if at all, suboptimal local optima? or could all of them be equally good? We provide a construction to show that suboptimal local minima (i.e., non-global ones), even though degenerate, exist for fully connected neural networks with sigmoid activation functions. The local minima obtained by our construction belong to a connected set of local solutions that can be escaped from via a non-increasing path on the loss curve. For extremely wide neural networks of decreasing width after the wide layer, we prove that every suboptimal local minimum belongs to such a connected set. This provides a partial explanation for the successful application of deep neural networks. In addition, we also characterize under what conditions the same construction leads to saddle points instead of local minima for deep neural networks.},

When the support points of the barycenter are pre-specified, this problem can be modeled as a linear programming (LP) problem whose size can be extremely large. To handle this large-scale LP, we analyse the structure of its dual problem, which is conceivably more tractable and can be reformulated as a well-structured convex problem with 3 kinds of block variables and a coupling linear equality constraint. We then adapt a symmetric Gauss-Seidel based alternating direction method of multipliers (sGS-ADMM) to solve the resulting dual problem and establish its global convergence and global linear convergence rate. As a critical component for efficient computation, we also show how all the subproblems involved can be solved exactly and efficiently. This makes our method suitable for computing a Wasserstein barycenter on a large-scale data set, without introducing an entropy regularization term as is commonly practiced. In addition, our sGS-ADMM can be used as a subroutine in an alternating minimization method to compute a barycenter when its support points are not pre-specified. Numerical results on synthetic data sets and image data sets demonstrate that our method is highly competitive for solving large-scale Wasserstein barycenter problems, in comparison to two existing representative methods and the commercial software Gurobi.},

@article{JMLR:v22:19-658,
 abstract = {Since many critical decisions impacting human lives are increasingly being made by algorithms, it is important to ensure that the treatment of individuals under such algorithms is demonstrably fair under reasonable notions of fairness. One compelling notion proposed in the literature is that of individual fairness (IF), which advocates that similar individuals should be treated similarly (Dwork et al. 2012). Originally proposed for offline decisions, this notion does not, however, account for temporal considerations relevant for online decision-making. In this paper, we extend the notion of IF to account for the time at which a decision is made, in settings where there exists a notion of conduciveness of decisions as perceived by the affected individuals. We introduce two definitions: (i) fairness-across-time (FT) and (ii) fairness-in-hindsight (FH). FT is the simplest temporal extension of IF where treatment of individuals is required to be individually fair relative to the past as well as future, while in FH, we require a one-sided notion of individual fairness that is defined relative to only the past decisions. We show that these two definitions can have drastically different implications in the setting where the principal needs to learn the utility model. Linear regret relative to optimal individually fair decisions is inevitable under FT for non-trivial examples. On the other hand, we design a new algorithm: Cautious Fair Exploration (CAFE), which satisfies FH and achieves sub-linear regret guarantees for a broad range of settings. We characterize lower bounds showing that these guarantees are order-optimal in the worst case. FH can thus be embedded as a primary safeguard against unfair discrimination in algorithmic deployments, without hindering the ability to take good decisions in the long-run.},

Borrowing tools and concepts from the field of quantum computing, such as partial trace and entanglement, we propose a new view on operator-valued kernels and define a general family of kernels that encompasses previously known operator-valued kernels, including separable and transformable kernels. Within this framework, we introduce another novel class of operator-valued kernels called entangled kernels that are not separable. We propose an efficient two-step algorithm for this framework, where the entangled kernel is learned based on a novel extension of kernel alignment to operator-valued kernels. We illustrate our algorithm with an application to supervised dimensionality reduction, and demonstrate its effectiveness with both artificial and real data for multi-output regression.},

More precisely, we assume that the data is sampled from a mixture model supported on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and pick a connectivity length-scale $\varepsilon&gt;0$ to construct a kernelized graph Laplacian. We introduce a notion of a well-separated mixture model which only depends on the model itself, and prove that when the model is well separated, with high probability the embedded data set concentrates on cones that are centered around orthogonal vectors. Our results are meaningful in the regime where $\varepsilon = \varepsilon(n)$ is allowed to decay to zero at a slow enough rate as the number of data points grows. This rate depends on the intrinsic dimension of the manifold on which the data is supported.},

However, little is known about even their most basic theoretical convergence properties, including: if and how fast they converge to a globally optimal solution or how they cope with approximation error due to using a restricted class of parametric policies. This work provides provable characterizations of the computational, approximation, and sample size properties of policy gradient methods in the context of discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We focus on both: tabular policy parameterizations, where the optimal policy is contained in the class and where we show global convergence to the optimal policy; and parametric policy classes (considering both log-linear and neural policy classes), which may not contain the optimal policy and where we provide agnostic learning results. One central contribution of this work is in providing approximation guarantees that are average case -- which avoid explicit worst-case dependencies on the size of state space -- by making a formal connection to supervised learning under distribution shift. This characterization shows an important interplay between estimation error, approximation error, and exploration (as characterized through a precisely defined condition number).},

Under elliptical symmetry, the problem can be reformulated as a proxy linear model in terms of an identifiable parameter, which characterization is then used to construct estimates of the regression coefficients of interest that are similar to the de-biased lasso estimates in the standard linear model and exhibit similar properties: square-root consistency and asymptotic normality. The procedure is agnostic in the sense that it completely bypasses the estimation of the link function, which can be extremely challenging depending on the underlying structure of the problem. Our method allows testing for the importance of pre-fixed covariates in the single-index model, as well as testing for the relative importance of coefficients via straightforward application of the delta method. Furthermore, under Gaussianity, we extend our approach to prescribe improved, i.e., more efficient estimates of the coefficients using a sieved strategy that involves an expansion of the true regression function in terms of Hermite polynomials. Finally, we illustrate our approach via carefully designed simulation experiments.},

 abstract = {Network complexity has been studied for over half a century and has found a wide range of applications. Many methods have been developed to characterize and estimate the complexity of networks. However, there has been little research with statistical guarantees. In this paper, we develop a statistical theory of graph complexity in a general model of random graphs, the so-called graphon model. Given a graphon, we endow the latent space of the nodes with the neighborhood distance that measures the propensity of two nodes to be connected with similar nodes. Our complexity index is then based on the covering number and the Minkowski dimension of (a purified version of) this metric space. Although the latent space is not identifiable, these indices turn out to be identifiable. This notion of complexity has simple interpretations on popular examples of random graphs: it matches the number of communities in stochastic block models; the dimension of the Euclidean space in random geometric graphs; the regularity of the link function in Hölder graphon models. From a single observation of the graph, we construct an estimator of the neighborhood-distance and show universal non-asymptotic bounds for its risk, matching minimax lower bounds. Based on this estimated distance, we compute the corresponding covering number and Minkowski dimension and we provide optimal non-asymptotic error bounds for these two plug-in estimators.},

More generally, we define an adversarial regime with a self-bounding constraint, which includes stochastic regime, stochastically constrained adversarial regime (Wei and Luo), and stochastic regime with adversarial corruptions (Lykouris et al.) as special cases, and show that the algorithm achieves logarithmic regret guarantee in this regime and all of its special cases simultaneously with the adversarial regret guarantee.} The algorithm also achieves adversarial and stochastic optimality in the utility-based dueling bandit setting. We provide empirical evaluation of the algorithm demonstrating that it significantly outperforms UCB1 and EXP3 in stochastic environments. We also provide examples of adversarial environments, where UCB1 and Thompson Sampling exhibit almost linear regret, whereas our algorithm suffers only logarithmic regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example demonstrating vulnerability of Thompson Sampling in adversarial environments.

We establish key theoretical results for the proposed MOCE procedure from which the expanded model can be selected with theoretical guarantees and simultaneous confidence regions can be constructed by the joint asymptotic normal distribution. In comparison with existing methods, our proposed method exhibits stable and reliable coverage at a nominal significance level with substantially less computational burden, and thus it is trustworthy for its application in solving real-world problems.},

Since some consumers and companies need a recommendation or prediction for future budget, labor and supply chain coordination, dynamic recommender systems for precise forecasting have become extremely necessary. In this article, we propose a new recommendation method, namely the dynamic tensor recommender system (DTRS), which aims particularly at forecasting future recommendation. The proposed method utilizes a tensor-valued function of time to integrate time and contextual information, and creates a time-varying coefficient model for temporal tensor factorization through a polynomial spline approximation. Major advantages of the proposed method include competitive future recommendation predictions and effective prediction interval estimations. In theory, we establish the convergence rate of the proposed tensor factorization and asymptotic normality of the spline coefficient estimator. The proposed method is applied to simulations and IRI marketing data. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of future time forecasting.},

Most dimensionality reduction methods allow out-of-sample extensions, by which an embedding can be applied to observations not present in the training set. Applied to graphs, the out-of-sample extension problem concerns how to compute the embedding of a vertex that is added to the graph after an embedding has already been computed. In this paper, we consider the out-of-sample extension problem for two graph embedding procedures: the adjacency spectral embedding and the Laplacian spectral embedding. In both cases, we prove that when the underlying graph is generated according to a latent space model called the random dot product graph, which includes the popular stochastic block model as a special case, an out-of-sample extension based on a least-squares objective obeys a central limit theorem about the true latent position of the out-of-sample vertex. In addition, we prove a concentration inequality for the out-of-sample extension of the adjacency spectral embedding based on a maximum-likelihood objective. Our results also yield a convenient framework in which to analyze trade-offs between estimation accuracy and computational expense, which we explore briefly.},

In this work, we propose a method that computes high quality almost-exact matches for high-dimensional categorical datasets. This method, called FLAME (Fast Large-scale Almost Matching Exactly), learns a distance metric for matching using a hold-out training data set. In order to perform matching efficiently for large datasets, FLAME leverages techniques that are natural for query processing in the area of database management, and two implementations of FLAME are provided: the first uses SQL queries and the second uses bit-vector techniques. The algorithm starts by constructing matches of the highest quality (exact matches on all covariates), and successively eliminates variables in order to match exactly on as many variables as possible, while still maintaining interpretable high-quality matches and balance between treatment and control groups. We leverage these high quality matches to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATEs). Our experiments show that FLAME scales to huge datasets with millions of observations where existing state-of-the-art methods fail, and that it achieves significantly better performance than other matching methods.},

 abstract = {Systems of interacting particles or agents have wide applications in many disciplines such as Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Economics. These systems are governed by interaction laws, which are often unknown: estimating them from observation data is a fundamental task that can provide meaningful insights and accurate predictions of the behaviour of the agents. In this paper, we consider the inverse problem of learning interaction laws given data from multiple trajectories, in a nonparametric fashion, when the interaction kernels depend on pairwise distances. We establish a condition for learnability of interaction kernels, and construct estimators that are guaranteed to converge in a suitable $L^2$ space, at the optimal min-max rate for 1-dimensional nonparametric regression. We propose an efficient learning algorithm based on least squares, which can be implemented in parallel for multiple trajectories and is therefore well-suited for the high dimensional, big data regime. Numerical simulations on a variety examples, including opinion dynamics, predator-swarm dynamics and heterogeneous particle dynamics, suggest that the learnability condition is satisfied in models used in practice, and the rate of convergence of our estimator is consistent with the theory. These simulations also suggest that our estimators are robust to noise in the observations, and produce accurate predictions of dynamics in relative large time intervals, even when they are learned from data collected in short time intervals.},

We present a general framework that addresses both of these issues via a unified computational abstraction that we refer to as "conflict sets."

But NMF do not have the provision to include the neighborhood structure information and, as a result, may fail to provide satisfactory performance in presence of nonlinear manifold structure. To address that shortcoming, we propose to consider and incorporate the neighborhood structural similarity information within the NMF framework by modeling the data through a minimum spanning tree. We label the resulting method as the neighborhood structure assisted NMF. We further devise both offline and online algorithmic versions of the proposed method. Empirical comparisons using twenty benchmark datasets as well as an industrial dataset extracted from a hydropower plant demonstrate the superiority of the neighborhood structure assisted NMF and support our claim of merit. Looking closer into the formulation and properties of the neighborhood structure assisted NMF with other recent, enhanced versions of NMF reveals that inclusion of the neighborhood structure information using MST plays a key role in attaining the enhanced performance in anomaly detection.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a formal approach to online learning and planning for agents operating in a priori unknown, time-varying environments. The proposed method computes the maximally likely model of the environment, given the observations about the environment made by an agent earlier in the system run and assuming knowledge of a bound on the maximal rate of change of system dynamics. Such an approach generalizes the estimation method commonly used in learning algorithms for unknown Markov decision processes with time-invariant transition probabilities, but is also able to quickly and correctly identify the system dynamics following a change. Based on the proposed method, we generalize the exploration bonuses used in learning for time-invariant Markov decision processes by introducing a notion of uncertainty in a learned time-varying model, and develop a control policy for time-varying Markov decision processes based on the exploitation and exploration trade-off. We demonstrate the proposed methods on four numerical examples: a patrolling task with a change in system dynamics, a two-state MDP with periodically changing outcomes of actions, a wind flow estimation task, and a multi-armed bandit problem with periodically changing probabilities of different rewards.},

 abstract = {Local graph clustering methods aim to find small clusters in very large graphs. These methods take as input a graph and a seed node, and they return as output a good cluster in a running time that depends on the size of the output cluster but that is independent of the size of the input graph. In this paper, we adopt a statistical perspective on local graph clustering, and we analyze the performance of the l1-regularized PageRank method~(Fountoulakis et. al.) for the recovery of a single target cluster, given a seed node inside the cluster. Assuming the target cluster has been generated by a random model, we present two results. In the first, we show that the optimal support of l1-regularized PageRank recovers the full target cluster, with bounded false positives. In the second, we show that if the seed node is connected solely to the target cluster then the optimal support of l1-regularized PageRank recovers exactly the target cluster. We also show empirically that l1-regularized PageRank has a state-of-the-art performance on many real graphs, demonstrating the superiority of the method. From a computational perspective, we show that the solution path of l1-regularized PageRank is monotonic. This allows for the application of the forward stagewise algorithm, which approximates the solution path in running time that does not depend on the size of the whole graph. Finally, we show that l1-regularized PageRank and approximate personalized PageRank (APPR), another very popular method for local graph clustering, are equivalent in the sense that we can lower and upper bound the output of one with the output of the other. Based on this relation, we establish for APPR similar results to those we establish for l1-regularized PageRank.},

Extensive experiments are conducted on both global optimization tasks and HPO applications. The numerical results show that the proposed SeqUD strategy outperforms benchmark HPO methods, and it can be therefore a promising and competitive alternative to existing AutoML tools.},

As a non-parametric approach, kernel learning faces a major challenge in distributed implementation: the decision variables of local objective functions are data-dependent and thus cannot be optimized under the decentralized consensus framework without any raw data exchange among agents. To circumvent this major challenge, we leverage the random feature (RF) approximation approach to enable consensus on the function modeled in the RF space by data-independent parameters across different agents. We then design an iterative algorithm, termed DKLA, for fast-convergent implementation via ADMM. Based on DKLA, we further develop a communication-censored kernel learning (COKE) algorithm that reduces the communication load of DKLA by preventing an agent from transmitting at every iteration unless its local updates are deemed informative. Theoretical results in terms of linear convergence guarantee and generalization performance analysis of DKLA and COKE are provided. Comprehensive tests on both synthetic and real datasets are conducted to verify the communication efficiency and learning effectiveness of COKE.},

 abstract = {Bayesian feature allocation models are a popular tool for modelling data with a combinatorial latent structure. Exact inference in these models is generally intractable and so practitioners typically apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for posterior inference. The most widely used MCMC strategies rely on an element wise Gibbs update of the feature allocation matrix. These element wise updates can be inefficient as features are typically strongly correlated. To overcome this problem we have developed a Gibbs sampler that can update an entire row of the feature allocation matrix in a single move. However, this sampler is impractical for models with a large number of features as the computational complexity scales exponentially in the number of features. We develop a Particle Gibbs sampler that targets the same distribution as the row wise Gibbs updates, but has computational complexity that only grows linearly in the number of features. We compare the performance of our proposed methods to the standard Gibbs sampler using synthetic data from a range of feature allocation models. Our results suggest that row wise updates using the PG methodology can significantly improve the performance of samplers for feature allocation models.},

We develop a new unsupervised data integration method named Integrated Principal Components Analysis (iPCA), which is a model-based generalization of PCA and serves as a practical tool to find and visualize common patterns that occur in multiple data sets. The key idea driving iPCA is the matrix-variate normal model, whose Kronecker product covariance structure captures both individual patterns within each data set and joint patterns shared by multiple data sets. Building upon this model, we develop several penalized (sparse and non-sparse) covariance estimators for iPCA, and using geodesic convexity, we prove that our non-sparse iPCA estimator converges to the global solution of a non-convex problem. We also demonstrate the practical advantages of iPCA through extensive simulations and a case study application to integrative genomics for Alzheimer's disease. In particular, we show that the joint patterns extracted via iPCA are highly predictive of a patient's cognition and Alzheimer's diagnosis.},

A key component of the algorithm is componentwise ordering and parent estimations, where both problems can be efficiently addressed using '1-regularized regression. This paper proves that sample sizes n = (d2 log p) and n = (d2p2=m) are sufficient for the proposed algorithm to recover linear SEMs with sub- Gaussian and (4m)-th bounded-moment error distributions, respectively, where p is the number of nodes and d is the maximum degree of the moralized graph. Further shown is the worst-case computational complexity O(n(p3 + p2d2)), and hence, the proposed algorithm is statistically consistent and computationally feasible for learning a high-dimensional linear SEM when its moralized graph is sparse. Through simulations, we verify that the proposed algorithm is statistically consistent and computationally feasible, and it performs well compared to the state-of-the-art US, GDS, LISTEN and TD algorithms with our settings.

In particular, we prove that the approximation capability of deep sigmoid nets is not worse than that of deep ReLU nets by showing that ReLU activation function can be well approximated by deep sigmoid nets with two hidden layers and finitely many free parameters but not vice-verse. We also establish the global convergence of the proposed ADMM for the nonlinearly constrained formulation of the deep sigmoid nets training from arbitrary initial points to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point at a rate of order ${\cal O}(1/k)$. Besides sigmoid activation, such a convergence theorem holds for a general class of smooth activations. Compared with the widely used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for the deep ReLU nets training (called ReLU-SGD pair), the proposed sigmoid-ADMM pair is practically stable with respect to the algorithmic hyperparameters including the learning rate, initial schemes and the pro-processing of the input data. Moreover, we find that to approximate and learn simple but important functions the proposed sigmoid-ADMM pair numerically outperforms the ReLU-SGD pair.},

This abstract tool was successfully used for the construction of optimal strategies in various repeated games, but also found several applications in online learning. By extending an approach proposed by (Abernethy et al., 2011), we construct and analyze a class of Follow the Regularized Leader algorithms (FTRL) for Blackwell's approachability which are able to minimize not only the Euclidean distance to the target set (as it is often the case in the context of Blackwell's approachability) but a wide range of distance-like quantities. This flexibility enables us to apply these algorithms to closely minimize the quantity of interest in various online learning problems. In particular, for regret minimization with $\ell_p$ global costs, we obtain the first bounds with explicit dependence in $p$ and the dimension $d$.},

 abstract = {Spiking neural networks (SNNs) has attracted much attention due to its great potential of modeling time-dependent signals. The firing rate of spiking neurons is decided by control rate which is fixed manually in advance, and thus, whether the firing rate is adequate for modeling actual time series relies on fortune. Though it is demanded to have an adaptive control rate, it is a non-trivial task because the control rate and the connection weights learned during the training process are usually entangled. In this paper, we show that the firing rate is related to the eigenvalue of the spike generation function. Inspired by this insight, by enabling the spike generation function to have adaptable eigenvalues rather than parametric control rates, we develop the Bifurcation Spiking Neural Network (BSNN), which has an adaptive firing rate and is insensitive to the setting of control rates. Experiments validate the effectiveness of BSNN on a broad range of tasks, showing that BSNN achieves superior performance to existing SNNs and is robust to the setting of control rates.},

In this work, our main goal is to understand what aspects of DR methods are important for preserving both local and global structure: it is difficult to design a better method without a true understanding of the choices we make in our algorithms and their empirical impact on the lower-dimensional embeddings they produce. Towards the goal of local structure preservation, we provide several useful design principles for DR loss functions based on our new understanding of the mechanisms behind successful DR methods. Towards the goal of global structure preservation, our analysis illuminates that the choice of which components to preserve is important. We leverage these insights to design a new algorithm for DR, called Pairwise Controlled Manifold Approximation Projection (PaCMAP), which preserves both local and global structure.

 abstract = {Low-rank matrix estimation is a canonical problem that finds numerous applications in signal processing, machine learning and imaging science. A popular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact low-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative methods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite nonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in fact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number of problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches can still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices: the convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition number of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating minimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is to set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient descent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a minimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix sensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we theoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges linearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix similar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss functions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank matrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that provably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation tasks.},

 abstract = {The theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) allows the certification of exponential convergence of interconnected systems containing nonlinear or uncertain elements. In this work, we adapt the IQC theory to study first-order methods for smooth and strongly-monotone games and show how to design tailored quadratic constraints to get tight upper bounds of convergence rates. Using this framework, we recover the existing bound for the gradient method~(GD), derive sharper bounds for the proximal point method~(PPM) and optimistic gradient method~(OG), and provide \emph{for the first time} a global convergence rate for the negative momentum method~(NM) with an iteration complexity $\mathcal{O}(κ^{1.5})$, which matches its known lower bound. In addition, for time-varying systems, we prove that the gradient method with optimal step size achieves the fastest provable worst-case convergence rate with quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, we further extend our analysis to stochastic games and study the impact of multiplicative noise on different algorithms. We show that it is impossible for an algorithm with one step of memory to achieve acceleration if it only queries the gradient once per batch (in contrast with the stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting, where such acceleration has been demonstrated). However, we exhibit an algorithm which achieves acceleration with two gradient queries per batch.},

 abstract = {It is a common practice in the machine learning community to assume that the observed data are noise-free in the input attributes. Nevertheless, scenarios with input noise are common in real problems, as measurements are never perfectly accurate. If this input noise is not taken into account, a supervised machine learning method is expected to perform sub-optimally. In this paper, we focus on multi-class classification problems and use Gaussian processes (GPs) as the underlying classifier. Motivated by a data set coming from the astrophysics domain, we hypothesize that the observed data may contain noise in the inputs. Therefore, we devise several multi-class GP classifiers that can account for input noise. Such classifiers can be efficiently trained using variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables of the model. Moreover, in some situations, the amount of noise can be known before-hand. If this is the case, it can be readily introduced in the proposed methods. This prior information is expected to lead to better performance results. We have evaluated the proposed methods by carrying out several experiments, involving synthetic and real data. These include several data sets from the UCI repository, the MNIST data set and a data set coming from astrophysics. The results obtained show that, although the classification error is similar across methods, the predictive distribution of the proposed methods is better, in terms of the test log-likelihood, than the predictive distribution of a classifier based on GPs that ignores input noise.},

 abstract = {We consider a distributed learning setting where each agent/learner holds a specific parametric model and data source. The goal is to integrate information across a set of learners to enhance the prediction accuracy of a given learner. A natural way to integrate information is to build a joint model across a group of learners that shares common parameters of interest. However, the underlying parameter sharing patterns across a set of learners may not be a priori known. Misspecifying the parameter sharing patterns or the parametric model for each learner often yields a biased estimation and degrades the prediction accuracy. We propose a general method to integrate information across a set of learners that is robust against misspecifications of both models and parameter sharing patterns. The main crux is to sequentially incorporate additional learners that can enhance the prediction accuracy of an existing joint model based on user-specified parameter sharing patterns across a set of learners. Theoretically, we show that the proposed method can data-adaptively select the most suitable way of parameter sharing and thus enhance the predictive performance of any particular learner of interest. Extensive numerical studies show the promising performance of the proposed method.},

Proto-NN is a significant simplification of OptiNet, a recently proposed compression-based algorithm that, to date, was the only algorithm known to be universally consistent in such a general setting. Practically, Proto-NN is simpler to implement and enjoys reduced computational complexity. We then proceed to study convergence rates of the excess error probability. We first obtain rates for the standard $k$-NN rule under a margin condition and a new generalized-Lipschitz condition. The latter is an extension of a recently proposed modified-Lipschitz condition from $\mathbb R^d$ to metric spaces. Similarly to the modified-Lipschitz condition, the new condition avoids any boundness assumptions on the data distribution. While obtaining rates for Proto-NN is left open, we show that a second prototype rule that hybridizes between $k$-NN and Proto-NN achieves the same rates as $k$-NN while enjoying similar computational advantages as Proto-NN. However, as $k$-NN, this hybrid rule is not consistent in general.},

 abstract = {Effective decision making requires understanding the uncertainty inherent in a prediction. In regression, this uncertainty can be estimated by a variety of methods; however, many of these methods are laborious to tune, generate overconfident uncertainty intervals, or lack sharpness (give imprecise intervals). We address these challenges by proposing a novel method to capture predictive distributions in regression by defining two neural networks with two distinct loss functions. Specifically, one network approximates the cumulative distribution function, and the second network approximates its inverse. We refer to this method as Collaborating Networks (CN). Theoretical analysis demonstrates that a fixed point of the optimization is at the idealized solution, and that the method is asymptotically consistent to the ground truth distribution. Empirically, learning is straightforward and robust. We benchmark CN against several common approaches on two synthetic and six real-world datasets, including forecasting A1c values in diabetic patients from electronic health records, where uncertainty is critical. In the synthetic data, the proposed approach essentially matches ground truth. In the real-world datasets, CN improves results on many performance metrics, including log-likelihood estimates, mean absolute errors, coverage estimates, and prediction interval widths.},

In this work, inspired by the phase diagram in statistical mechanics, we draw the phase diagram for the two-layer ReLU neural network at the infinite-width limit for a complete characterization of its dynamical regimes and their dependence on hyperparameters related to initialization. Through both experimental and theoretical approaches, we identify three regimes in the phase diagram, i.e., linear regime, critical regime and condensed regime, based on the relative change of input weights as the width approaches infinity, which tends to $0$, $O(1)$ and $+\infty$, respectively. In the linear regime, NN training dynamics is approximately linear similar to a random feature model with an exponential loss decay. In the condensed regime, we demonstrate through experiments that active neurons are condensed at several discrete orientations. The critical regime serves as the boundary between above two regimes, which exhibits an intermediate nonlinear behavior with the mean-field model as a typical example. Overall, our phase diagram for the two-layer ReLU NN serves as a map for the future studies and is a first step towards a more systematical investigation of the training behavior and the implicit regularization of NNs of different structures.},

The formulation can be applied directly to post-process classifier outputs and we also explore a pre-processing extension, thus allowing maximum freedom in selecting a classification algorithm. We derive a closed-form expression for the optimal transformed scores and a convex optimization problem for the transformation parameters. In the population limit, the transformed score function is the fairness-constrained minimizer of cross-entropy with respect to the true conditional probability of the outcome. In the finite sample setting, we propose a method called FairScoreTransformer to approach this solution using a combination of standard probabilistic classifiers and ADMM. We provide several consistency and finite-sample guarantees for FairScoreTransformer, relating to the transformation parameters and transformed score function that it obtains. Comprehensive experiments comparing to 10 existing methods show that FairScoreTransformer has advantages for score-based metrics such as Brier score and AUC while remaining competitive for binary label-based metrics such as accuracy.},

Given sample access to the Gibbs distribution corresponding to an unknown or hidden model $M^*$ and given an explicit model $M$, can we distinguish if either $M = M^*$ or if they are (statistically) far apart? Daskalakis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model. In contrast, for the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) Ising model, Bezakova et al.

We prove analogous hardness results for RBMs (i.e., mixed Ising models on bipartite graphs), even when there are no latent variables or an external field. Specifically, we show that if $RP \neq NP$, then when $\beta d=\omega(\log{n})$ there is no polynomial-time algorithm for identity testing for RBMs; when $\beta d =O(\log{n})$ there is an efficient identity testing algorithm that utilizes the structure learning algorithm of Klivans and Meka (2017). In addition, we prove similar lower bounds for purely ferromagnetic RBMs with inconsistent external fields, and for the ferromagnetic Potts model. Previous hardness results for identity testing of Bezakova et al. (2019) utilized the hardness of finding the maximum cuts, which corresponds to the ground states of the antiferromagnetic Ising model. Since RBMs are on bipartite graphs such an approach is not feasible. We instead introduce a general methodology to reduce from the corresponding approximate counting problem and utilize the phase transition that is exhibited by RBMs and the mean-field Potts model.},

 abstract = {Factorization machines (FMs) are machine learning predictive models based on second-order feature interactions and FMs with sparse regularization are called sparse FMs. Such regularizations enable feature selection, which selects the most relevant features for accurate prediction, and therefore they can contribute to the improvement of the model accuracy and interpretability. However, because FMs use second-order feature interactions, the selection of features often causes the loss of many relevant feature interactions in the resultant models. In such cases, FMs with regularization specially designed for feature interaction selection trying to achieve interaction-level sparsity may be preferred instead of those just for feature selection trying to achieve feature-level sparsity. In this paper, we present a new regularization scheme for feature interaction selection in FMs. The proposed regularizer is an upper bound of the $\ell_1$ regularizer for the feature interaction matrix, which is computed from the parameter matrix of FMs. For feature interaction selection, our proposed regularizer makes the feature interaction matrix sparse without a restriction on sparsity patterns imposed by the existing methods. We also describe efficient proximal algorithms for the proposed FMs and present theoretical analyses of both existing and the new regularize. In addition, we will discuss how our ideas can be applied or extended to more accurate feature selection and other related models such as higher-order FMs and the all-subsets model.

 abstract = {Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) is a popular Bayesian sampling method. For the log-concave distribution function, the method converges exponentially fast, up to a controllable discretization error. However, the method requires the evaluation of a full gradient in each iteration, and for a problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$, this amounts to $d$ times partial derivative evaluations per iteration. The cost is high when $d\gg1$. In this paper, we investigate how to enhance computational efficiency through the application of RCD (random coordinate descent) on LMC. There are two sides of the theory: 1 By blindly applying RCD to LMC, one surrogates the full gradient by a randomly selected directional derivative per iteration. Although the cost is reduced per iteration, the total number of iteration is increased to achieve a preset error tolerance. Ultimately there is no computational gain; 2 We then incorporate variance reduction techniques, such as SAGA (stochastic average gradient) and SVRG (stochastic variance reduced gradient), into RCD-LMC. It will be proved that the cost is reduced compared with the classical LMC, and in the underdamped case, convergence is achieved with the same number of iterations, while each iteration requires merely one-directional derivative. This means we obtain the best possible computational cost in the underdamped-LMC framework.},

 abstract = {Modern machine learning methods are often overparametrized, allowing adaptation to the data at a fine level. This can seem puzzling; in the worst case, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great amount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a phenomenon called "double descent". Recent work aimed to understand in greater depth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This leads to discovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of parametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label noise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the sources of the error. In this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we propose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the test error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of certain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis of variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and training data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the monotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work studied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of each term in variance decomposition. One key insight is that in typical settings, the interaction between training samples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger than their marginal effect. Also, we characterize "phase transitions" where the variance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage advanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that -- to our knowledge -- have not yet been used in the area. We also verify our results in numerical simulations and on empirical data examples.},

To understand the empirical successes and failures of DA methods, we propose a theoretical framework via structural causal models that enables analysis and comparison of the prediction performance of DA methods. This framework also allows us to itemize the assumptions needed for the DA methods to have a low target error.

Our method deterministically quantizes layers in an iterative fashion with no complicated re-training required. Specifically, we quantize each neuron, or hidden unit, using a greedy path-following algorithm. This simple algorithm is equivalent to running a dynamical system, which we prove is stable for quantizing a single-layer neural network (or, alternatively, for quantizing the first layer of a multi-layer network) when the training data are Gaussian. We show that under these assumptions, the quantization error decays with the width of the layer, i.e., its level of over-parametrization. We provide numerical experiments, on multi-layer networks, to illustrate the performance of our methods on MNIST and CIFAR10 data, as well as for quantizing the VGG16 network using ImageNet data.},

Our method is based on a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations derived from applying the dynamic programming principle to continuous-time Q-functions. A novel semi-discrete version of the HJB equation is proposed to design a Q-learning algorithm that uses data collected in discrete time without discretizing or approximating the system dynamics. We identify the condition under which the Q-function estimated by this algorithm converges to the optimal Q-function. For practical implementation, we propose the Hamilton-Jacobi DQN, which extends the idea of deep Q-networks (DQN) to our continuous control setting. This approach does not require actor networks or numerical solutions to optimization problems for greedy actions since the HJB equation provides a simple characterization of optimal controls via ordinary differential equations. We empirically demonstrate the performance of our method through benchmark tasks and high-dimensional linear-quadratic problems.},

We focus on two different settings: strongly convex and nonconvex problems, but also discuss the non-strongly convex case. Our main contribution consists of new non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates for a wide class of shuffling-type gradient methods in both nonconvex and convex settings. We also study uniformly randomized shuffling variants with different learning rates and model assumptions. While our rate in the nonconvex case is new and significantly improved over existing works under standard assumptions, the rate on the strongly convex one matches the existing best-known rates prior to this paper up to a constant factor without imposing a bounded gradient condition. Finally, we empirically illustrate our theoretical results via two numerical examples: nonconvex logistic regression and neural network training examples. As byproducts, our results suggest some appropriate choices for diminishing learning rates in certain shuffling variants.},

We fill in this gap by introducing the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) and establish stronger and more interpretable learning bounds. These bounds provide new insights into when PATE works and improve over existing results even in the narrower realizable setting. We also investigate the compelling idea of using active learning for saving privacy budget, and empirical studies show the effectiveness of this new idea. The novel components in the proofs include a more refined analysis of the majority voting classifier - which could be of independent interest - and an observation that the synthetic "student" learning problem is nearly realizable by construction under the Tsybakov noise condition.},

 abstract = {We study the optimization landscape and the stability properties of training problems with squared loss for neural networks and general nonlinear conic approximation schemes. It is demonstrated that, if a nonlinear conic approximation scheme is considered that is (in an appropriately defined sense) more expressive than a classical linear approximation approach and if there exist unrealizable label vectors, then a training problem with squared loss is necessarily unstable in the sense that its solution set depends discontinuously on the label vector in the training data. We further prove that the same effects that are responsible for these instability properties are also the reason for the emergence of saddle points and spurious local minima, which may be arbitrarily far away from global solutions, and that neither the instability of the training problem nor the existence of spurious local minima can, in general, be overcome by adding a regularization term to the objective function that penalizes the size of the parameters in the approximation scheme. The latter results are shown to be true regardless of whether the assumption of realizability is satisfied or not. We demonstrate that our analysis in particular applies to training problems for free-knot interpolation schemes and deep and shallow neural networks with variable widths that involve an arbitrary mixture of various activation functions (e.g., binary, sigmoid, tanh, arctan, soft-sign, ISRU, soft-clip, SQNL, ReLU, leaky ReLU, soft-plus, bent identity, SILU, ISRLU, and ELU). In summary, the findings of this paper illustrate that the improved approximation properties of neural networks and general nonlinear conic approximation instruments are linked in a direct and quantifiable way to undesirable properties of the optimization problems that have to be solved in order to train them.},

 abstract = {As Gaussian processes are used to answer increasingly complex questions, analytic solutions become scarcer and scarcer. Monte Carlo methods act as a convenient bridge for connecting intractable mathematical expressions with actionable estimates via sampling. Conventional approaches for simulating Gaussian process posteriors view samples as draws from marginal distributions of process values at finite sets of input locations. This distribution-centric characterization leads to generative strategies that scale cubically in the size of the desired random vector. These methods are prohibitively expensive in cases where we would, ideally, like to draw high-dimensional vectors or even continuous sample paths. In this work, we investigate a different line of reasoning: rather than focusing on distributions, we articulate Gaussian conditionals at the level of random variables. We show how this pathwise interpretation of conditioning gives rise to a general family of approximations that lend themselves to efficiently sampling Gaussian process posteriors. Starting from first principles, we derive these methods and analyze the approximation errors they introduce. We, then, ground these results by exploring the practical implications of pathwise conditioning in various applied settings, such as global optimization and reinforcement learning.},

 abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm for optimization problems arising in high-dimensional inference tasks. Here one produces an estimator of an unknown parameter from independent samples of data by iteratively optimizing a loss function. This loss function is random and often non-convex. We study the performance of the simplest version of SGD, namely online SGD, from a random start in the setting where the parameter space is high-dimensional. We develop nearly sharp thresholds for the number of samples needed for consistent estimation as one varies the dimension. Our thresholds depend only on an intrinsic property of the population loss which we call the information exponent. In particular, our results do not assume uniform control on the loss itself, such as convexity or uniform derivative bounds. The thresholds we obtain are polynomial in the dimension and the precise exponent depends explicitly on the information exponent. As a consequence of our results, we find that except for the simplest tasks, almost all of the data is used simply in the initial search phase to obtain non-trivial correlation with the ground truth. Upon attaining non-trivial correlation, the descent is rapid and exhibits law of large numbers type behavior. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a wide set of inference tasks such as phase retrieval, and parameter estimation for generalized linear models, online PCA, and spiked tensor models, as well as to supervised learning for single-layer networks with general activation functions.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of $k$-way clustering in signed graphs. Considerable attention in recent years has been devoted to analyzing and modeling signed graphs, where the affinity measure between nodes takes either positive or negative values. Recently, Cucuringu et al. [CDGT 2019] proposed a spectral method, namely SPONGE (Signed Positive over Negative Generalized Eigenproblem), which casts the clustering task as a generalized eigenvalue problem optimizing a suitably defined objective function. This approach is motivated by social balance theory, where the clustering task aims to decompose a given network into disjoint groups, such that individuals within the same group are connected by as many positive edges as possible, while individuals from different groups are mainly connected by negative edges. Through extensive numerical simulations, SPONGE was shown to achieve state-of-the-art empirical performance. On the theoretical front, [CDGT 2019] analyzed SPONGE and the popular Signed Laplacian method under the setting of a Signed Stochastic Block Model (SSBM), for $k=2$ equal-sized clusters, in the regime where the graph is moderately dense. In this work, we build on the results in [CDGT 2019] on two fronts for the normalized versions of SPONGE and the Signed Laplacian. Firstly, for both algorithms, we extend the theoretical analysis in [CDGT 2019] to the general setting of $k \geq 2$ unequal-sized clusters in the moderately dense regime. Secondly, we introduce regularized versions of both methods to handle sparse graphs -- a regime where standard spectral methods underperform -- and provide theoretical guarantees under the same SSBM model. To the best of our knowledge, regularized spectral methods have so far not been considered in the setting of clustering signed graphs. We complement our theoretical results with an extensive set of numerical experiments on synthetic data.},

One reason is a limited understanding of the behavior of reinforcement algorithms, both in terms of their regret and their ability to learn the underlying system dynamics---existing work is focused almost exclusively on characterizing rates, with little attention paid to the constants multiplying those rates that can be critically important in practice. To start to address this challenge, we study perhaps the simplest non-bandit reinforcement learning problem: linear quadratic adaptive control (LQAC). By carefully combining recent finite-sample performance bounds for the LQAC problem with a particular (less-recent) martingale central limit theorem, we are able to derive asymptotically-exact expressions for the regret, estimation error, and prediction error of a rate-optimal stepwise-updating LQAC algorithm. In simulations on both stable and unstable systems, we find that our asymptotic theory also describes the algorithm's finite-sample behavior remarkably well.},

A possible solution is proposed that enables the user to posit an appropriate Gaussian process covariance function for the task at hand. Our approach constructs a prior distribution for the parameters of the network, called a ridgelet prior, that approximates the posited Gaussian process in the output space of the network. In contrast to existing work on the connection between neural networks and Gaussian processes, our analysis is non-asymptotic, with finite sample-size error bounds provided. This establishes the universality property that a Bayesian neural network can approximate any Gaussian process whose covariance function is sufficiently regular. Our experimental assessment is limited to a proof-of-concept, where we demonstrate that the ridgelet prior can out-perform an unstructured prior on regression problems for which a suitable Gaussian process prior can be provided.},

We describe a new unified class of methods, removal-based explanations, that are based on the principle of simulating feature removal to quantify each feature's influence. These methods vary in several respects, so we develop a framework that characterizes each method along three dimensions: 1) how the method removes features, 2) what model behavior the method explains, and 3) how the method summarizes each feature's influence. Our framework unifies 26 existing methods, including several of the most widely used approaches: SHAP, LIME, Meaningful Perturbations, and permutation tests. This newly understood class of explanation methods has rich connections that we examine using tools that have been largely overlooked by the explainability literature. To anchor removal-based explanations in cognitive psychology, we show that feature removal is a simple application of subtractive counterfactual reasoning. Ideas from cooperative game theory shed light on the relationships and trade-offs among different methods, and we derive conditions under which all removal-based explanations have information-theoretic interpretations. Through this analysis, we develop a unified framework that helps practitioners better understand model explanation tools, and that offers a strong theoretical foundation upon which future explainability research can build.},

However, existing solutions are mainly for continuous and nominal data. In this work, we propose an iterative score-and-search method - called the Ordinal Structural EM (OSEM) algorithm - for learning Bayesian networks from ordinal data. Unlike traditional approaches designed for nominal data, we explicitly respect the ordering amongst the categories. More precisely, we assume that the ordinal variables originate from marginally discretizing a set of Gaussian variables, whose structural dependence in the latent space follows a directed acyclic graph. Then, we adopt the Structural EM algorithm and derive closed-form scoring functions for efficient graph searching. Through simulation studies, we illustrate the superior performance of the OSEM algorithm compared to the alternatives and analyze various factors that may influence the learning accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our method with a real-world application on psychological survey data from 408 patients with co-morbid symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression.},

 abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the dominant neural network architecture for solving visual processing tasks. One of the major obstacles hindering the ubiquitous use of CNNs for inference is their relatively high memory bandwidth requirements, which can be a main energy consumer and throughput bottleneck in hardware accelerators. Accordingly, an efficient feature map compression method can result in substantial performance gains. Inspired by quantization-aware training approaches, we propose a compression-aware training (CAT) method that involves training the model in a way that allows better compression of feature maps during inference. Our method trains the model to achieve low-entropy feature maps, which enables efficient compression at inference time using classical transform coding methods. CAT significantly improves the state-of-the-art results reported for quantization. For example, on ResNet-34 we achieve 73.1% accuracy (0.2% degradation from the baseline) with an average representation of only 1.79 bits per value.

In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive empirical study of approaches to maximise the acquisition function. Additionally, by deriving novel, yet mathematically equivalent, compositional forms for popular acquisition functions, we recast the maximisation task as a compositional optimisation problem, allowing us to benefit from the extensive literature in this field. We highlight the empirical advantages of the compositional approach to acquisition function maximisation across 3958 individual experiments comprising synthetic optimisation tasks as well as tasks from Bayesmark. Given the generality of the acquisition function maximisation subroutine, we posit that the adoption of compositional optimisers has the potential to yield performance improvements across all domains in which Bayesian optimisation is currently being applied.},

We prove this by drawing a connection to the Bernstein condition, which is known to imply fast rates in offline statistical learning. MetaGrad further adapts automatically to the size of the gradients. Its main feature is that it simultaneously considers multiple learning rates, which are weighted directly proportional to their empirical performance on the data using a new meta-algorithm. We provide three versions of MetaGrad. The full matrix version maintains a full covariance matrix and is applicable to learning tasks for which we can afford update time quadratic in the dimension. The other two versions provide speed-ups for high-dimensional learning tasks with an update time that is linear in the dimension: one is based on sketching, the other on running a separate copy of the basic algorithm per coordinate. We evaluate all versions of MetaGrad on benchmark online classification and regression tasks, on which they consistently outperform both online gradient descent and AdaGrad.},

We also characterize the classification decision regions in terms of a kernel matrix and minimum $\ell_1$-norm solutions. This is in contrast to Neural Tangent Kernel which is unable to explain predictions of finite width networks. Our convex geometric characterization also provides intuitive explanations of hidden neurons as auto-encoders. In higher dimensions, we show that the training problem can be cast as a finite dimensional convex problem with infinitely many constraints. Then, we apply certain convex relaxations and introduce a cutting-plane algorithm to globally optimize the network. We further analyze the exactness of the relaxations to provide conditions for the convergence to a global optimum.

The joint embedding is modeled by representing the processes in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The functions can be defined on arbitrary smooth manifolds where the action of a Lie group aligns them. The continuous functions allow the registration to be independent of a specific signal resolution. The framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the Riemannian gradient and Hessian. We study a more specialized but widely used case where the Lie group acts on functions isometrically. We solve the problem by maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over data, while the continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured through the integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Low-dimensional cases are derived with numerical examples to show the generality of the proposed framework. The high-dimensional derivation for the special Euclidean group acting on the Euclidean space showcases the point cloud registration and bird's-eye view map registration abilities. An implementation of this framework for RGB-D cameras outperforms the state-of-the-art robust visual odometry and performs well in texture and structure-scarce environments.},

 abstract = {Counterfactual inference has become a ubiquitous tool in online advertisement, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, and econometrics. Accurate modeling of outcome distributions associated with different interventions -- known as counterfactual distributions -- is crucial for the success of these applications. In this work, we propose to model counterfactual distributions using a novel Hilbert space representation called counterfactual mean embedding (CME). The CME embeds the associated counterfactual distribution into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) endowed with a positive definite kernel, which allows us to perform causal inference over the entire landscape of the counterfactual distribution. Based on this representation, we propose a distributional treatment effect (DTE) that can quantify the causal effect over entire outcome distributions. Our approach is nonparametric as the CME can be estimated under the unconfoundedness assumption from observational data without requiring any parametric assumption about the underlying distributions. We also establish a rate of convergence of the proposed estimator which depends on the smoothness of the conditional mean and the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the underlying marginal distributions. Furthermore, our framework allows for more complex outcomes such as images, sequences, and graphs. Our experimental results on synthetic data and off-policy evaluation tasks demonstrate the advantages of the proposed estimator.},

In machine learning settings where the dataset consists of signals defined on many different graphs, the trained ConvNet should generalize to signals on graphs unseen in the training set. It is thus important to transfer ConvNets between graphs. Transferability, which is a certain type of generalization capability, can be loosely defined as follows: if two graphs describe the same phenomenon, then a single filter or ConvNet should have similar repercussions on both graphs. This paper aims at debunking the common misconception that spectral filters are not transferable. We show that if two graphs discretize the same "continuous" space, then a spectral filter or ConvNet has approximately the same repercussion on both graphs. Our analysis is more permissive than the standard analysis. Transferability is typically described as the robustness of the filter to small graph perturbations and re-indexing of the vertices. Our analysis accounts also for large graph perturbations. We prove transferability between graphs that can have completely different dimensions and topologies, only requiring that both graphs discretize the same underlying space in some generic sense.},

 abstract = {It is becoming increasingly important to understand the vulnerability of machine learning models to adversarial attacks. In this paper we study the feasibility of robust learning from the perspective of computational learning theory, considering both sample and computational complexity. In particular, our definition of robust learnability requires polynomial sample complexity. We start with two negative results. We show that no non-trivial concept class can be robustly learned in the distribution-free setting against an adversary who can perturb just a single input bit. We show moreover that the class of monotone conjunctions cannot be robustly learned under the uniform distribution against an adversary who can perturb $\omega(\log n)$ input bits. However if the adversary is restricted to perturbing $O(\log n)$ bits, then the class of monotone conjunctions can be robustly learned with respect to a general class of distributions (that includes the uniform distribution). Finally, we provide a simple proof of the computational hardness of robust learning on the boolean hypercube. Unlike previous results of this nature, our result does not rely on another computational model (e.g. the statistical query model) nor on any hardness assumption other than the existence of a hard learning problem in the PAC framework.},

 abstract = {One of the challenges in machine learning research is to ensure that presented and published results are sound and reliable. Reproducibility, that is obtaining similar results as presented in a paper or talk, using the same code and data (when available), is a necessary step to verify the reliability of research findings. Reproducibility is also an important step to promote open and accessible research, thereby allowing the scientific community to quickly integrate new findings and convert ideas to practice. Reproducibility also promotes the use of robust experimental workflows, which potentially reduce unintentional errors. In 2019, the Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) conference, the premier international conference for research in machine learning, introduced a reproducibility program, designed to improve the standards across the community for how we conduct, communicate, and evaluate machine learning research. The program contained three components: a code submission policy, a community-wide reproducibility challenge, and the inclusion of the Machine Learning Reproducibility checklist as part of the paper submission process. In this paper, we describe each of these components, how it was deployed, as well as what we were able to learn from this initiative.},

The dominant parametric approach is based on locally normalized models which predict one word at a time. While these work remarkably well, they are plagued by exposure bias due to the greedy nature of the generation process. In this work, we investigate un-normalized energy-based models (EBMs) which operate not at the token but at the sequence level. In order to make training tractable, we first work in the residual of a pretrained locally normalized language model and second we train using noise contrastive estimation. Furthermore, since the EBM works at the sequence level, we can leverage pretrained bi-directional contextual representations, such as BERT and RoBERTa. Our experiments on two large language modeling datasets show that residual EBMs yield lower perplexity compared to locally normalized baselines. Moreover, generation via importance sampling is very efficient and of higher quality than the baseline models according to human evaluation.},

From these finite-sample bounds it follows that the classical discrepancy principle is statistically adaptive for slow rates occurring in the hard learning scenario, while the smoothed discrepancy principles are adaptive over ranges of faster rates (resp. higher smoothness parameters).

For linear signals, we introduce an algorithm with similarities to the Fourier transform but which does not rely on periodicity assumptions, allowing for forecasting given potentially arbitrary sampling intervals. We then extend this algorithm to handle nonlinearities by leveraging Koopman theory. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition in a nonlinear, data-dependent basis. The optimization objective for both algorithms is highly non-convex. However, expressing the objective in the frequency domain allows us to compute global optima of the error surface in a scalable and efficient manner, partially by exploiting the computational properties of the Fast Fourier Transform. Because of their close relation to Bayesian Spectral Analysis, uncertainty quantification metrics are a natural byproduct of the spectral forecasting methods. We extensively benchmark these algorithms against other leading forecasting methods on a range of synthetic experiments as well as in the context of real-world power systems and fluid flows.},

 abstract = {Random Matrix Theory (RMT) is applied to analyze weight matrices of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), including both production quality, pre-trained models such as AlexNet and Inception, and smaller models trained from scratch, such as LeNet5 and a miniature-AlexNet. Empirical and theoretical results clearly indicate that the DNN training process itself implicitly implements a form of Self-Regularization. The empirical spectral density (ESD) of DNN layer matrices displays signatures of traditionally-regularized statistical models, even in the absence of exogenously specifying traditional forms of explicit regularization. Building on relatively recent results in RMT, most notably its extension to Universality classes of Heavy-Tailed matrices, we develop a theory to identify 5+1 Phases of Training, corresponding to increasing amounts of Implicit Self-Regularization. These phases can be observed during the training process as well as in the final learned DNNs. For smaller and/or older DNNs, this Implicit Self-Regularization is like traditional Tikhonov regularization, in that there is a "size scale" separating signal from noise. For state-of-the-art DNNs, however, we identify a novel form of Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization, similar to the self-organization seen in the statistical physics of disordered systems. This results from correlations arising at all size scales, which arises implicitly due to the training process itself. This implicit Self-Regularization can depend strongly on the many knobs of the training process. By exploiting the generalization gap phenomena, we demonstrate that we can cause a small model to exhibit all 5+1 phases of training simply by changing the batch size. This demonstrates that---all else being equal---DNN optimization with larger batch sizes leads to less-well implicitly-regularized models, and it provides an explanation for the generalization gap phenomena.},

 abstract = {There is tremendous interest in precision medicine as a means to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatment to individual characteristics. An individualized treatment rule formalizes precision medicine as a map from patient information to a recommended treatment. A treatment rule is defined to be optimal if it maximizes the mean of a scalar outcome in a population of interest, e.g., symptom reduction. However, clinical and intervention scientists often seek to balance multiple and possibly competing outcomes, e.g., symptom reduction and the risk of an adverse event. One approach to precision medicine in this setting is to elicit a composite outcome which balances all competing outcomes; unfortunately, eliciting a composite outcome directly from patients is difficult without a high-quality instrument, and an expert-derived composite outcome may not account for heterogeneity in patient preferences. We propose a new paradigm for the study of precision medicine using observational data that relies solely on the assumption that clinicians are approximately (i.e., imperfectly) making decisions to maximize individual patient utility. Estimated composite outcomes are subsequently used to construct an estimator of an individualized treatment rule which maximizes the mean of patient-specific composite outcomes. The estimated composite outcomes and estimated optimal individualized treatment rule provide new insights into patient preference heterogeneity, clinician behavior, and the value of precision medicine in a given domain. We derive inference procedures for the proposed estimators under mild conditions and demonstrate their finite sample performance through a suite of simulation experiments and an illustrative application to data from a study of bipolar depression.},

We propose partial policy iteration, a new, efficient, flexible, and general policy iteration scheme for robust MDPs. We also propose fast methods for computing the robust Bellman operator in quasi-linear time, nearly matching the linear complexity the non-robust Bellman operator.

 abstract = {Statistical methods relating tensor predictors to scalar outcomes in a regression model generally vectorize the tensor predictor and estimate the coefficients of its entries employing some form of regularization, use summaries of the tensor covariate, or use a low dimensional approximation of the coefficient tensor. However, low rank approximations of the coefficient tensor can suffer if the true rank is not small. We propose a tensor regression framework which assumes a soft version of the parallel factors (PARAFAC) approximation. In contrast to classic PARAFAC, where each entry of the coefficient tensor is the sum of products of row-specific contributions across the tensor modes, the soft tensor regression (Softer) framework allows the row-specific contributions to vary around an overall mean. We follow a Bayesian approach to inference, and show that softening the PARAFAC increases model flexibility, leads to improved estimation of coefficient tensors, more accurate identification of important predictor entries, and more precise predictions, even for a low approximation rank. From a theoretical perspective, we show that employing Softer leads to a weakly consistent posterior distribution of the coefficient tensor, irrespective of the true or approximation tensor rank, a result that is not true when employing the classic PARAFAC for tensor regression. In the context of our motivating application, we adapt Softer to symmetric and semi-symmetric tensor predictors and analyze the relationship between brain network characteristics and human traits.soft},

Building on these successes, a large number of empirical studies have validated the benefits of the cousin approach called Wasserstein GANs (WGANs), which brings stabilization in the training process. In the present paper, we add a new stone to the edifice by proposing some theoretical advances in the properties of WGANs. First, we properly define the architecture of WGANs in the context of integral probability metrics parameterized by neural networks and highlight some of their basic mathematical features. We stress in particular interesting optimization properties arising from the use of a parametric 1-Lipschitz discriminator. Then, in a statistically-driven approach, we study the convergence of empirical WGANs as the sample size tends to infinity, and clarify the adversarial effects of the generator and the discriminator by underlining some trade-off properties. These features are finally illustrated with experiments using both synthetic and real-world datasets.},

In this paper, we argue for examining adversarial examples from the perspective of Bayes-Optimal classification. We construct realistic image datasets for which the Bayes-Optimal classifier can be efficiently computed and derive analytic conditions on the distributions under which these classifiers are provably robust against any adversarial attack even in high dimensions. Our results show that even when these "gold standard" optimal classifiers are robust, CNNs trained on the same datasets consistently learn a vulnerable classifier, indicating that adversarial examples are often an avoidable "bug". We further show that RBF SVMs trained on the same data consistently learn a robust classifier. The same trend is observed in experiments with real images in different datasets.},

 abstract = {We propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on third-order Langevin dynamics for sampling from distributions with log-concave and smooth densities. The higher-order dynamics allow for more flexible discretization schemes, and we develop a specific method that combines splitting with more accurate integration. For a broad class of $d$-dimensional distributions arising from generalized linear models, we prove that the resulting third-order algorithm produces samples from a distribution that is at most $\varepsilon > 0$ in Wasserstein distance from the target distribution in $O\left(\frac{d^{1/4}}{ \varepsilon^{1/2}} \right)$ steps. This result requires only Lipschitz conditions on the gradient. For general strongly convex potentials with $\alpha$-th order smoothness, we prove that the mixing time scales as $O \left(\frac{d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}} + \frac{d^{1/2}}{\varepsilon^{1/(\alpha - 1)}} \right)$.},

 abstract = {We develop a variational framework to understand the properties of the functions learned by neural networks fit to data. We propose and study a family of continuous-domain linear inverse problems with total variation-like regularization in the Radon domain subject to data fitting constraints. We derive a representer theorem showing that finite-width, single-hidden layer neural networks are solutions to these inverse problems. We draw on many techniques from variational spline theory and so we propose the notion of polynomial ridge splines, which correspond to single-hidden layer neural networks with truncated power functions as the activation function. The representer theorem is reminiscent of the classical reproducing kernel Hilbert space representer theorem, but we show that the neural network problem is posed over a non-Hilbertian Banach space. While the learning problems are posed in the continuous-domain, similar to kernel methods, the problems can be recast as finite-dimensional neural network training problems. These neural network training problems have regularizers which are related to the well-known weight decay and path-norm regularizers. Thus, our result gives insight into functional characteristics of trained neural networks and also into the design neural network regularizers. We also show that these regularizers promote neural network solutions with desirable generalization properties.},

 abstract = {Matrix factorization methods - including Factor analysis (FA), and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) - are widely used for inferring and summarizing structure in multivariate data. Many matrix factorization methods exist, corresponding to different assumptions on the elements of the underlying matrix factors. For example, many recent methods use a penalty or prior distribution to achieve sparse representations (Sparse FA/PCA). Here we introduce a general Empirical Bayes approach to matrix factorization (EBMF), whose key feature is that it uses the observed data to estimate prior distributions on matrix elements. We derive a correspondingly-general variational fitting algorithm, which reduces fitting EBMF to solving a simpler problem - the so-called normal means problem. We implement this general algorithm, but focus particular attention on the use of sparsity-inducing priors that are uni-modal at 0. This yields a sparse EBMF approach - essentially a version of sparse FA/PCA - that automatically adapts the amount of sparsity to the data. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through both numerical comparisons with competing methods and through analysis of data from the GTEx (Genotype Tissue Expression) project on genetic associations across 44 human tissues. In numerical comparisons EBMF often provides more accurate inferences than other methods. In the GTEx data, EBMF identifies interpretable structure that concords with known relationships among human tissues. Software implementing our approach is available at this https URL},

In the RaSE algorithm, we aggregate many weak learners, where each weak learner is a base classifier trained in a subspace optimally selected from a collection of random subspaces. To conduct subspace selection, we propose a new criterion, ratio information criterion (RIC), based on weighted Kullback-Leibler divergence. The theoretical analysis includes the risk and Monte-Carlo variance of the RaSE classifier, establishing the screening consistency and weak consistency of RIC, and providing an upper bound for the misclassification rate of the RaSE classifier. In addition, we show that in a high-dimensional framework, the number of random subspaces needs to be very large to guarantee that a subspace covering signals is selected. Therefore, we propose an iterative version of the RaSE algorithm and prove that under some specific conditions, a smaller number of generated random subspaces are needed to find a desirable subspace through iteration. An array of simulations under various models and real-data applications demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the RaSE classifier and its iterative version in terms of low misclassification rate and accurate feature ranking.

For a class of continuous-time stochastic RNNs (SRNNs) driven by an input signal, we derive a Volterra type series representation for their output. This representation is interpretable and disentangles the input signal from the SRNN architecture. The kernels of the series are certain recursively defined correlation functions with respect to the unperturbed dynamics that completely determine the output. Exploiting connections of this representation and its implications to rough paths theory, we identify a universal feature -- the response feature, which turns out to be the signature of tensor product of the input signal and a natural support basis. In particular, we show that the SRNNs can be viewed as kernel machines operating on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the response feature.},

 abstract = {Distributed machine learning systems have been receiving increasing attentions for their efficiency to process large scale data. Many distributed frameworks have been proposed for different machine learning tasks. In this paper, we study the distributed kernel regression via the divide and conquer approach. This approach has been proved asymptotically minimax optimal if the kernel is perfectly selected so that the true regression function lies in the associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, this is usually, if not always, impractical because kernels that can only be selected via prior knowledge or a tuning process are hardly perfect. Instead it is more common that the kernel is good enough but imperfect in the sense that the true regression can be well approximated by but does not lie exactly in the kernel space. We show distributed kernel regression can still achieves capacity independent optimal rate in this case. To this end, we first establish a general framework that allows to analyze distributed regression with response weighted base algorithms by bounding the error of such algorithms on a single data set, provided that the error bounds has factored the impact of the unexplained variance of the response variable. Then we perform a leave one out analysis of the kernel ridge regression and bias corrected kernel ridge regression, which in combination with the aforementioned framework allows us to derive sharp error bounds and capacity independent optimal rates for the associated distributed kernel regression algorithms. As a byproduct of the thorough analysis, we also prove the kernel ridge regression can achieve rates faster than $N^{-1}$ (where $N$ is the sample size) in the noise free setting which, to our best knowledge, are first observed and novel in regression learning.},

There has been a lot of work to analyze the sparsity guarantees of various algorithms (LASSO, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT)) in terms of the Restricted Condition Number $\kappa$. The best known algorithms guarantee to find an approximate solution of value $f(x^*)+\epsilon$ with the sparsity bound of $\gamma = O\left(\kappa\min\left\{\log \frac{f(x^0)-f(x^*)}{\epsilon}, \kappa\right\}\right)$, where $x^*$ is the target solution. We present a new Adaptively Regularized Hard Thresholding (ARHT) algorithm that makes significant progress on this problem by bringing the bound down to $\gamma=O(\kappa)$, which has been shown to be tight for a general class of algorithms including LASSO, OMP, and IHT. This is achieved without significant sacrifice in the runtime efficiency compared to the fastest known algorithms. We also provide a new analysis of OMP with Replacement (OMPR) for general $f$, under the condition $s > s^* \frac{\kappa^2}{4}$, which yields Compressed Sensing bounds under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP). When compared to other Compressed Sensing approaches, it has the advantage of providing a strong tradeoff between the RIP condition and the solution sparsity, while working for any general function $f$ that meets the RIP condition.},

 abstract = {Despite the availability of numerous statistical and machine learning tools for joint feature modeling, many scientists investigate features marginally, i.e., one feature at a time. This is partly due to training and convention but also roots in scientists' strong interests in simple visualization and interpretability. As such, marginal feature ranking for some predictive tasks, e.g., prediction of cancer driver genes, is widely practiced in the process of scientific discoveries. In this work, we focus on marginal ranking for binary classification, one of the most common predictive tasks. We argue that the most widely used marginal ranking criteria, including the Pearson correlation, the two-sample t test, and two-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test, do not fully take feature distributions and prediction objectives into account. To address this gap in practice, we propose two ranking criteria corresponding to two prediction objectives: the classical criterion (CC) and the Neyman-Pearson criterion (NPC), both of which use model-free nonparametric implementations to accommodate diverse feature distributions. Theoretically, we show that under regularity conditions, both criteria achieve sample-level ranking that is consistent with their population-level counterpart with high probability. Moreover, NPC is robust to sampling bias when the two class proportions in a sample deviate from those in the population. This property endows NPC good potential in biomedical research where sampling biases are ubiquitous. We demonstrate the use and relative advantages of CC and NPC in simulation and real data studies. Our model-free objective-based ranking idea is extendable to ranking feature subsets and generalizable to other prediction tasks and learning objectives.},

 abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) generalise remarkably well in the overparameterised regime, suggesting a strong inductive bias towards functions with low generalisation error. We empirically investigate this bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the probability PSGD(f∣S) that an overparameterised DNN, trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a function f consistent with a training set S. We also use Gaussian processes to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability PB(f∣S) that the DNN expresses f upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on S. Our main findings are that PSGD(f∣S) correlates remarkably well with PB(f∣S) and that PB(f∣S) is strongly biased towards low-error and low complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the parameter-function map (which determines PB(f∣S)), rather than a special property of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in the overparameterised regime. While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior PB(f∣S) is the first order determinant of PSGD(f∣S), there remain second order differences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability picture, based on PSGD(f∣S) and/or PB(f∣S), can shed light on the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as batch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.},

Despite this, it is actually still possible to derive a consistent non-parametric estimator of $m_0$ under the assumption of monotonicity of $m_0$ and knowledge of the distribution of the noise $ε$. In this paper, we establish an upper bound on the rate of convergence of such an estimator under minimal assumption on the distribution of the covariate $X$. We discuss extensions to the case in which the distribution of the noise is unknown. We develop a second order algorithm for its computation, and we demonstrate its use on synthetic data.

 abstract = {Gradient descent (GD) is known to converge quickly for convex objective functions, but it can be trapped at local minima. On the other hand, Langevin dynamics (LD) can explore the state space and find global minima, but in order to give accurate estimates, LD needs to run with a small discretization step size and weak stochastic force, which in general slow down its convergence. This paper shows that these two algorithms and their non-swapping variants. can ``collaborate" through a simple exchange mechanism, in which they swap their current positions if LD yields a lower objective function. This idea can be seen as the singular limit of the replica-exchange technique from the sampling literature. We show that this new algorithm converges to the global minimum linearly with high probability, assuming the objective function is strongly convex in a neighborhood of the unique global minimum. By replacing gradients with stochastic gradients, and adding a proper threshold to the exchange mechanism, our algorithm can also be used in online settings. We also study non-swapping variants of the algorithm, which achieve similar performance. We further verify our theoretical results through some numerical experiments and observe superior performance of the proposed algorithm over running GD or LD alone.},

 abstract = {Modern neural networks (NN) featuring a large number of layers (depth) and units per layer (width) have achieved a remarkable performance across many domains. While there exists a vast literature on the interplay between infinitely wide NNs and Gaussian processes, a little is known about analogous interplays with respect to infinitely deep NNs. NNs with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) initializations exhibit undesirable forward and backward propagation properties as the number of layers increases. To overcome these drawbacks, Peluchetti and Favaro (2020) considered fully-connected residual networks (ResNets) with network's parameters initialized by means of distributions that shrink as the number of layers increases, thus establishing an interplay between infinitely deep ResNets and solutions to stochastic differential equations, i.e. diffusion processes, and showing that infinitely deep ResNets does not suffer from undesirable forward-propagation properties. In this paper, we review the results of Peluchetti and Favaro (2020), extending them to convolutional ResNets, and we establish analogous backward-propagation results, which directly relate to the problem of training fully-connected deep ResNets. Then, we investigate the more general setting of doubly infinite NNs, where both network's width and network's depth grow unboundedly. We focus on doubly infinite fully-connected ResNets, for which we consider i.i.d. initializations. Under this setting, we show that the dynamics of quantities of interest converge, at initialization, to deterministic limits. This allow us to provide analytical expressions for inference, both in the case of weakly trained and fully trained ResNets. Our results highlight a limited expressive power of doubly infinite ResNets when the unscaled network's parameters are i.i.d. and the residual blocks are shallow.},

 abstract = {We design a new algorithm for the Euclidean $k$-means problem that operates in the local model of differential privacy. Unlike in the non-private literature, differentially private algorithms for the $k$-means incur both additive and multiplicative errors. Our algorithm significantly reduces the additive error while keeping the multiplicative error the same as in previous state-of-the-art results. Specifically, on a database of size $n$, our algorithm guarantees $O(1)$ multiplicative error and $\approx n^{1/2+a}$ additive error for an arbitrarily small constant $a$, whereas all previous algorithms in the local model on had additive error $\approx n^{2/3+a}$. 
We give a simple lower bound showing that additive error of $\approx\sqrt{n}$ is necessary for $k$-means algorithms in the local model (at least for algorithms with a constant number of interaction rounds, which is the setting we consider in this paper).},

 abstract = {Constructing or learning a function from a finite number of sampled data points (measurements) is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. This is often formulated as a minimum norm interpolation problem, regularized learning problem or, in general, a semi-discrete inverse problem, in certain functional spaces. The choice of an appropriate space is crucial for solutions of these problems. Motivated by sparse representations of the reconstructed functions such as compressed sensing and sparse learning, much of the recent research interest has been directed to considering these problems in certain Banach spaces in order to obtain their sparse solutions, which is a feasible approach to overcome challenges coming from the big data nature of most practical applications. It is the goal of this paper to provide a systematic study of the representer theorems for these problems in Banach spaces. There are a few existing results for these problems in a Banach space, with all of them regarding implicit representer theorems. We aim at obtaining explicit representer theorems based on which convenient solution methods will then be developed. For the minimum norm interpolation, the explicit representer theorems enable us to express the infimum in terms of the norm of the linear combination of the interpolation functionals. For the purpose of developing efficient computational algorithms, we establish the fixed-point equation formulation of solutions of these problems. We reveal that unlike in a Hilbert space, in general, solutions of these problems in a Banach space may not be able to be reduced to truly finite dimensional problems (with certain infinite dimensional components hidden). We demonstrate how this obstacle can be removed, reducing the original problem to a truly finite dimensional one, in the special case when the Banach space is $\ell_1(\mathbb{N})$.},

A challenge here is that typical conformal prediction methods---which give marginal validity (coverage) guarantees---provide uneven coverage, in that they address easy examples at the expense of essentially ignoring difficult examples. By leveraging ideas from quantile regression, we build methods that always guarantee correct coverage but additionally provide (asymptotically optimal) conditional coverage for both multiclass and multilabel prediction problems. To address the potential challenge of exponentially large confidence sets in multilabel prediction, we build tree-structured classifiers that efficiently account for interactions between labels. Our methods can be bolted on top of any classification model---neural network, random forest, boosted tree---to guarantee its validity. We also provide an empirical evaluation, simultaneously providing new validation methods, that suggests the more robust coverage of our confidence sets.},

 abstract = {A sparse regression approach for the computation of high-dimensional optimal feedback laws arising in deterministic nonlinear control is proposed. The approach exploits the control-theoretical link between Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDEs characterizing the value function of the optimal control problems, and first-order optimality conditions via Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. The latter is used as a representation formula to recover the value function and its gradient at arbitrary points in the space-time domain through the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. After generating a dataset consisting of different state-value pairs, a hyperbolic cross polynomial model for the value function is fitted using a LASSO regression. An extended set of low and high-dimensional numerical tests in nonlinear optimal control reveal that enriching the dataset with gradient information reduces the number of training samples, and that the sparse polynomial regression consistently yields a feedback law of lower complexity.},

 abstract = {Identifying informative predictors in a high dimensional regression model is a critical step for association analysis and predictive modeling. Signal detection in the high dimensional setting often fails due to the limited sample size. One approach to improving power is through meta-analyzing multiple studies which address the same scientific question. However, integrative analysis of high dimensional data from multiple studies is challenging in the presence of between-study heterogeneity. The challenge is even more pronounced with additional data sharing constraints under which only summary data can be shared across different sites. In this paper, we propose a novel data shielding integrative large-scale testing (DSILT) approach to signal detection allowing between-study heterogeneity and not requiring the sharing of individual level data. Assuming the underlying high dimensional regression models of the data differ across studies yet share similar support, the proposed method incorporates proper integrative estimation and debiasing procedures to construct test statistics for the overall effects of specific covariates. We also develop a multiple testing procedure to identify significant effects while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) and false discovery proportion (FDP). Theoretical comparisons of the new testing procedure with the ideal individual-level meta-analysis (ILMA) approach and other distributed inference methods are investigated. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed testing procedure performs well in both controlling false discovery and attaining power. The new method is applied to a real example detecting interaction effects of the genetic variants for statins and obesity on the risk for type II diabetes.},

 abstract = {This paper considers online optimization of a renewal-reward system. A controller performs a sequence of tasks back-to-back. Each task has a random vector of parameters, called the task type vector, that affects the task processing options and also affects the resulting reward and time duration of the task. The probability distribution for the task type vector is unknown and the controller must learn to make efficient decisions so that time average reward converges to optimality. Prior work on such renewal optimization problems leaves open the question of optimal convergence time. This paper develops an algorithm with an optimality gap that decays like $O(1/\sqrt{k})$, where $k$ is the number of tasks processed. The same algorithm is shown to have faster $O(\log(k)/k)$ performance when the system satisfies a strong concavity property. The proposed algorithm uses an auxiliary variable that is updated according to a classic Robbins-Monro iteration. It makes online scheduling decisions at the start of each renewal frame based on this variable and on the observed task type. A matching converse is obtained for the strongly concave case by constructing an example system for which all algorithms have performance at best $Ω(\log(k)/k)$. A matching $Ω(1/\sqrt{k})$ converse is also shown for the general case without strong concavity.},

The procedure we propose, called proxBoost, is elementary and builds on two well-known ingredients: robust distance estimation and the proximal point method.

Gaussian tensors of order $k$ with the promise that $\mathbb{E}\mathbf{T}_1$ is a rank-1 tensor and $\|\mathbb{E} \mathbf{T}_1\| = 1$. The goal is to estimate $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{T}_1$. This problem exhibits a large conjectured hard phase when $k&gt;2$: When $d \lesssim n \ll d^{\frac{k}{2}}$ it is information theoretically possible to estimate $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{T}_1$, but no polynomial time estimator is known. We provide a sharp analysis of the optimal sample complexity in the Statistical Query (SQ) model and show that SQ algorithms with polynomial query complexity not only fail to solve Tensor PCA in the conjectured hard phase, but also have a strictly sub-optimal sample complexity compared to some polynomial time estimators such as the Richard-Montanari spectral estimator. Our analysis reveals that the optimal sample complexity in the SQ model depends on whether $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{T}_1$ is symmetric or not. For symmetric, even order tensors, we also isolate a sample size regime in which it is possible to test if $\mathbb{E} \mathbf{T}_1 = \mathbf{0}$ or $\mathbb{E}\mathbf{T}_1 \neq \mathbf{0}$ with polynomially many queries but not estimate $\mathbb{E}\mathbf{T}_1$. Our proofs rely on the Fourier analytic approach of Feldman, Perkins and Vempala (2018) to prove sharp SQ lower bounds.},

 abstract = {Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable, and one obvious approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of the available features. In linear models, Lasso (or $\ell_1$-regularized) regression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features, and is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear models. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global feature selection. Our approach enforces a hierarchy: specifically a feature can participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. On systematic experiments, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks. It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network.},

We present two training objectives, used here for the first time in connection with training neural networks. These two training objectives are derived from tight PAC-Bayes bounds. We also re-implement a previously used training objective based on a classical PAC-Bayes bound, to compare the properties of the predictors learned using the different training objectives. We compute risk certificates for the learnt predictors, based on part of the data used to learn the predictors. We further experiment with different types of priors on the weights (both data-free and data-dependent priors) and neural network architectures. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show that our training methods produce competitive test set errors and non-vacuous risk bounds with much tighter values than previous results in the literature, showing promise not only to guide the learning algorithm through bounding the risk but also for model selection. These observations suggest that the methods studied here might be good candidates for self-certified learning, in the sense of using the whole data set for learning a predictor and certifying its risk on any unseen data (from the same distribution as the training data) potentially without the need for holding out test data.},

We show the upper bounds of mode-$k$ singular subspace estimation are unilateral and converge linearly to a quantity characterized by blockwise errors of the perturbation and signal strength. For the tensor reconstruction error bound, we express the bound through a simple quantity $ξ$, which depends only on perturbation and the multilinear rank of the underlying signal. Rate matching deterministic lower bound for tensor reconstruction, which demonstrates the optimality of HOOI, is also provided. Furthermore, we prove that one-step HOOI (i.e., HOOI with only a single iteration) is also optimal in terms of tensor reconstruction and can be used to lower the computational cost. The perturbation results are also extended to the case that only partial modes of $\bcT$ have low-rank structure. We support our theoretical results by extensive numerical studies. Finally, we apply the novel perturbation bounds of HOOI on two applications, tensor denoising and tensor co-clustering, from machine learning and statistics, which demonstrates the superiority of the new perturbation results.},

In robust statistics, the median-of-means (MOM) has been a popular approach to hedge against Byzantine failures due to its ease of implementation and computational efficiency. However, the MOM estimator has the shortcoming in terms of statistical efficiency. The first main contribution of the paper is to propose a variance reduced median-of-means (VRMOM) estimator, which improves the statistical efficiency over the vanilla MOM estimator and is computationally as efficient as the MOM. Based on the proposed VRMOM estimator, we develop a general distributed inference algorithm that is robust against Byzantine failures. Theoretically, our distributed algorithm achieves a fast convergence rate with only a constant number of rounds of communications. We also provide the asymptotic normality result for the purpose of statistical inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first normality result in the setting of Byzantine-robust distributed learning. The simulation results are also presented to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.},

 abstract = {A line of recent works established that when training linear predictors over separable data, using gradient methods and exponentially-tailed losses, the predictors asymptotically converge in direction to the max-margin predictor. As a consequence, the predictors asymptotically do not overfit. However, this does not address the question of whether overfitting might occur non-asymptotically, after some bounded number of iterations. In this paper, we formally show that standard gradient methods (in particular, gradient flow, gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent) never overfit on separable data: If we run these methods for $T$ iterations on a dataset of size $m$, both the empirical risk and the generalization error decrease at an essentially optimal rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\gamma^2 T)$ up till $T\approx m$, at which point the generalization error remains fixed at an essentially optimal level of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\gamma^2 m)$ regardless of how large $T$ is. Along the way, we present non-asymptotic bounds on the number of margin violations over the dataset, and prove their tightness.},

 abstract = {When seeing a new object, humans can immediately recognize it across different retinal locations: the internal object representation is invariant to translation. It is commonly believed that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are architecturally invariant to translation thanks to the convolution and/or pooling operations they are endowed with. In fact, several studies have found that these networks systematically fail to recognise new objects on untrained locations. In this work, we test a wide variety of CNNs architectures showing how, apart from DenseNet-121, none of the models tested was architecturally invariant to translation. Nevertheless, all of them could learn to be invariant to translation. We show how this can be achieved by pretraining on ImageNet, and it is sometimes possible with much simpler data sets when all the items are fully translated across the input canvas. At the same time, this invariance can be disrupted by further training due to catastrophic forgetting/interference. These experiments show how pretraining a network on an environment with the right `latent' characteristics (a more naturalistic environment) can result in the network learning deep perceptual rules which would dramatically improve subsequent generalization.},

 abstract = {Graph matching aims to find the latent vertex correspondence between two edge-correlated graphs and has found numerous applications across different fields. In this paper, we study a seeded graph matching problem, which assumes that a set of seeds, i.e., pre-mapped vertex-pairs, is given in advance. While most previous work requires all seeds to be correct, we focus on the setting where the seeds are partially correct. Specifically, consider two correlated graphs whose edges are sampled independently from a parent \ER graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. A mapping between the vertices of the two graphs is provided as seeds, of which an unknown $β$ fraction is correct. We first analyze a simple algorithm that matches vertices based on the number of common seeds in the $1$-hop neighborhoods, and then further propose a new algorithm that uses seeds in the $2$-hop neighborhoods. We establish non-asymptotic performance guarantees of perfect matching for both $1$-hop and $2$-hop algorithms, showing that our new $2$-hop algorithm requires substantially fewer correct seeds than the $1$-hop algorithm when graphs are sparse. Moreover, by combining our new performance guarantees for the $1$-hop and $2$-hop algorithms, we attain the best-known results (in terms of the required fraction of correct seeds) across the entire range of graph sparsity and significantly improve the previous results in \cite{10.14778/2794367.2794371,lubars2018correcting} when $p\ge n^{-5/6}$. For instance, when $p$ is a constant or $p=n^{-3/4}$, we show that only $Ω(\sqrt{n\log n})$ correct seeds suffice for perfect matching, while the previously best-known results demand $Ω(n)$ and $Ω(n^{3/4}\log n)$ correct seeds, respectively. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superiority of our $2$-hop algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real graphs.},

Given the growing range of applications of SDP-based techniques to machine learning problems, and the rapid progress in the design of efficient algorithms for solving SDPs, an intriguing question is to understand how the recent advances from empirical process theory and Statistical Learning Theory can be leveraged for providing a precise statistical analysis of SDP estimators. In the present paper, we borrow cutting edge techniques and concepts from the Learning Theory literature, such as fixed point equations and excess risk curvature arguments, which yield general estimation and prediction results for a wide class of SDP estimators. From this perspective, we revisit some classical results in community detection from Guedon and Vershynin (2016) and Fei and Chen (2019), and we obtain statistical guarantees for SDP estimators used in signed clustering, angular group synchronization (for both multiplicative and additive models) and MAX-CUT. Our theoretical findings are complemented by numerical experiments for each of the three problems considered, showcasing the competitiveness of the SDP estimators.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic perspective on iterative methods for approximating the solution $\mathbf{x}_* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ of a nonsingular linear system $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_* = \mathbf{b}$. In the approach a standard iterative method on $\mathbb{R}^d$ is lifted to act on the space of probability distributions $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Classically, an iterative method produces a sequence $\mathbf{x}_m$ of approximations that converge to $\mathbf{x}_*$. The output of the iterative methods proposed in this paper is, instead, a sequence of probability distributions $\mu_m \in \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The distributional output both provides a best guess for $\mathbf{x}_*$, for example as the mean of $\mu_m$, and also probabilistic uncertainty quantification for the value of $\mathbf{x}_*$ when it has not been exactly determined. Theoretical analysis is provided in the prototypical case of a stationary linear iterative method. In this setting we characterise both the rate of contraction of $\mu_m$ to an atomic measure on $\mathbf{x}_*$ and the nature of the uncertainty quantification being provided. We conclude with an empirical illustration that highlights the insight into solution uncertainty that can be provided by probabilistic iterative methods.},

As a result, we can initialize $\beta$-VAE nets by maximum likelihood estimates (MLE) that enhance the training performance on both synthetic and real world data sets.

 abstract = {Across machine learning, the use of curricula has shown strong empirical potential to improve learning from data by avoiding local optima of training objectives. For reinforcement learning (RL), curricula are especially interesting, as the underlying optimization has a strong tendency to get stuck in local optima due to the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Recently, a number of approaches for an automatic generation of curricula for RL have been shown to increase performance while requiring less expert knowledge compared to manually designed curricula. However, these approaches are seldomly investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deeper understanding of their mechanics. In this paper, we present an approach for automated curriculum generation in RL with a clear theoretical underpinning. More precisely, we formalize the well-known self-paced learning paradigm as inducing a distribution over training tasks, which trades off between task complexity and the objective to match a desired task distribution. Experiments show that training on this induced distribution helps to avoid poor local optima across RL algorithms in different tasks with uninformative rewards and challenging exploration requirements.},

A novel approximation is proposed for the information gain -- an information-theoretic quantity central to solving a range of BO problems, including noisy, multi-fidelity and batch optimisations across both continuous and highly-structured discrete spaces. Previously, these problems have been tackled separately within information-theoretic BO, each requiring a different sophisticated approximation scheme, except for batch BO, for which no computationally-lightweight information-theoretic approach has previously been proposed. GIBBON (General-purpose Information-Based Bayesian OptimisatioN) provides a single principled framework suitable for all the above, out-performing existing approaches whilst incurring substantially lower computational overheads. In addition, GIBBON does not require the problem's search space to be Euclidean and so is the first high-performance yet computationally light-weight acquisition function that supports batch BO over general highly structured input spaces like molecular search and gene design. Moreover, our principled derivation of GIBBON yields a natural interpretation of a popular batch BO heuristic based on determinantal point processes. Finally, we analyse GIBBON across a suite of synthetic benchmark tasks, a molecular search loop, and as part of a challenging batch multi-fidelity framework for problems with controllable experimental noise.},

 abstract = {Sparse optimization problems are ubiquitous in many fields such as statistics, signal/image processing and machine learning. This has led to the birth of many iterative algorithms to solve them. A powerful strategy to boost the performance of these algorithms is known as safe screening: it allows the early identification of zero coordinates in the solution, which can then be eliminated to reduce the problem's size and accelerate convergence. In this work, we extend the existing Gap Safe screening framework by relaxing the global strong-concavity assumption on the dual cost function. Instead, we exploit local regularity properties, that is, strong concavity on well-chosen subsets of the domain. The non-negativity constraint is also integrated to the existing framework. Besides making safe screening possible to a broader class of functions that includes beta-divergences (e.g., the Kullback-Leibler divergence), the proposed approach also improves upon the existing Gap Safe screening rules on previously applicable cases (e.g., logistic regression). The proposed general framework is exemplified by some notable particular cases: logistic function, beta = 1.5 and Kullback-Leibler divergences. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of the proposed screening rules with different solvers (coordinate descent, multiplicative-update and proximal gradient algorithms) and different data sets (binary classification, hyperspectral and count data).},

Recently, several methods have been proposed for unsupervised learning of object-centric representations. However, since these models were evaluated on different downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR, which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may provide fruitful guidance towards learning more robust object-centric video representations.},

 abstract = {High-dimensional data sets are often analyzed and explored via the construction of a latent low-dimensional space which enables convenient visualization and efficient predictive modeling or clustering. For complex data structures, linear dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA may not be sufficiently flexible to enable low-dimensional representation. Non-linear dimension reduction techniques, like kernel PCA and autoencoders, suffer from loss of interpretability since each latent variable is dependent of all input dimensions. To address this limitation, we here present path lasso penalized autoencoders. This structured regularization enhances interpretability by penalizing each path through the encoder from an input to a latent variable, thus restricting how many input variables are represented in each latent dimension. Our algorithm uses a group lasso penalty and non-negative matrix factorization to construct a sparse, non-linear latent representation. We compare the path lasso regularized autoencoder to PCA, sparse PCA, autoencoders and sparse autoencoders on real and simulated data sets. We show that the algorithm exhibits much lower reconstruction errors than sparse PCA and parameter-wise lasso regularized autoencoders for low-dimensional representations. Moreover, path lasso representations provide a more accurate reconstruction match, i.e. preserved relative distance between objects in the original and reconstructed spaces.},

This model belongs to the class of Consensus-Based Optimization. In fact, particles move on the sphere driven by a drift towards an instantaneous consensus point, which is computed as a convex combination of particle locations, weighted by the cost function according to Laplace's principle, and it represents an approximation to a global minimizer. The dynamics is further perturbed by a random vector field to favor exploration, whose variance is a function of the distance of the particles to the consensus point. In particular, as soon as the consensus is reached the stochastic component vanishes. The main results of this paper are about the proof of convergence of the numerical scheme to global minimizers provided conditions of well-preparation of the initial datum. The proof combines previous results of mean-field limit with a novel asymptotic analysis, and classical convergence results of numerical methods for SDE. We present several numerical experiments, which show that the algorithm proposed in the present paper scales well with the dimension and is extremely versatile. To quantify the performances of the new approach, we show that the algorithm is able to perform essentially as good as ad hoc state of the art methods in challenging problems in signal processing and machine learning, namely the phase retrieval problem and the robust subspace detection.},

We propose an inferential procedure based on double generative adversarial networks (GANs). Specifically, we first introduce a double GANs framework to learn two generators of the conditional distributions. We then integrate the two generators to construct a test statistic, which takes the form of the maximum of generalized covariance measures of multiple transformation functions. We also employ data-splitting and cross-fitting to minimize the conditions on the generators to achieve the desired asymptotic properties, and employ multiplier bootstrap to obtain the corresponding $p$-value. We show that the constructed test statistic is doubly robust, and the resulting test both controls type-I error and has the power approaching one asymptotically. Also notably, we establish those theoretical guarantees under much weaker and practically more feasible conditions compared to the existing tests, and our proposal gives a concrete example of how to utilize some state-of-the-art deep learning tools, such as GANs, to help address a classical but challenging statistical problem.

This leads to a decentralized PCA algorithm called \texttt{DeEPCA}, which has a convergence rate similar to that of the centralized PCA, while achieving the best communication complexity among existing decentralized PCA algorithms. \texttt{DeEPCA} is the first decentralized PCA algorithm with the number of communication rounds for each power iteration independent of target precision. Compared to existing algorithms, the proposed method is easier to tune in practice, with an improved overall communication cost. Our experiments validate the advantages of \texttt{DeEPCA} empirically.},

 abstract = {Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) are two popular Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference that can scale to large datasets, allowing to sample from the posterior distribution of the parameters of a statistical model given the input data and the prior distribution over the model parameters. However, these algorithms do not apply to the decentralized learning setting, when a network of agents are working collaboratively to learn the parameters of a statistical model without sharing their individual data due to privacy reasons or communication constraints. We study two algorithms: Decentralized SGLD (DE-SGLD) and Decentralized SGHMC (DE-SGHMC) which are adaptations of SGLD and SGHMC methods that allow scaleable Bayesian inference in the decentralized setting for large datasets. We show that when the posterior distribution is strongly log-concave and smooth, the iterates of these algorithms converge linearly to a neighborhood of the target distribution in the 2-Wasserstein distance if their parameters are selected appropriately. We illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms on decentralized Bayesian linear regression and Bayesian logistic regression problems.},

 abstract = {The growing energy and performance costs of deep learning have driven the community to reduce the size of neural networks by selectively pruning components. Similarly to their biological counterparts, sparse networks generalize just as well, if not better than, the original dense networks. Sparsity can reduce the memory footprint of regular networks to fit mobile devices, as well as shorten training time for ever growing networks. In this paper, we survey prior work on sparsity in deep learning and provide an extensive tutorial of sparsification for both inference and training. We describe approaches to remove and add elements of neural networks, different training strategies to achieve model sparsity, and mechanisms to exploit sparsity in practice. Our work distills ideas from more than 300 research papers and provides guidance to practitioners who wish to utilize sparsity today, as well as to researchers whose goal is to push the frontier forward. We include the necessary background on mathematical methods in sparsification, describe phenomena such as early structure adaptation, the intricate relations between sparsity and the training process, and show techniques for achieving acceleration on real hardware. We also define a metric of pruned parameter efficiency that could serve as a baseline for comparison of different sparse networks. We close by speculating on how sparsity can improve future workloads and outline major open problems in the field.},

 abstract = {Tech companies (e.g., Google or Facebook) often use randomized online experiments and/or A/B testing primarily based on the average treatment effects to compare their new product with an old one. However, it is also critically important to detect qualitative treatment effects such that the new one may significantly outperform the existing one only under some specific circumstances. The aim of this paper is to develop a powerful testing procedure to efficiently detect such qualitative treatment effects. We propose a scalable online updating algorithm to implement our test procedure. It has three novelties including adaptive randomization, sequential monitoring, and online updating with guaranteed type-I error control. We also thoroughly examine the theoretical properties of our testing procedure including the limiting distribution of test statistics and the justification of an efficient bootstrap method. Extensive empirical studies are conducted to examine the finite sample performance of our test procedure.},

 abstract = {We present a framework that allows for the non-asymptotic study of the $2$-Wasserstein distance between the invariant distribution of an ergodic stochastic differential equation and the distribution of its numerical approximation in the strongly log-concave case. This allows us to study in a unified way a number of different integrators proposed in the literature for the overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. In addition, we analyse a novel splitting method for the underdamped Langevin dynamics which only requires one gradient evaluation per time step. Under an additional smoothness assumption on a $d$--dimensional strongly log-concave distribution with condition number $\kappa$, the algorithm is shown to produce with an $\mathcal{O}\big(\kappa^{5/4} d^{1/4}\epsilon^{-1/2} \big)$ complexity samples from a distribution that, in Wasserstein distance, is at most $\epsilon>0$ away from the target distribution.},

 abstract = {This paper develops a general framework for analyzing asymptotics of $V$-statistics. Previous literature on limiting distribution mainly focuses on the cases when $n \to \infty$ with fixed kernel size $k$. Under some regularity conditions, we demonstrate asymptotic normality when $k$ grows with $n$ by utilizing existing results for $U$-statistics. The key in our approach lies in a mathematical reduction to $U$-statistics by designing an equivalent kernel for $V$-statistics. We also provide a unified treatment on variance estimation for both $U$- and $V$-statistics by observing connections to existing methods and proposing an empirically more accurate estimator. Ensemble methods such as random forests, where multiple base learners are trained and aggregated for prediction purposes, serve as a running example throughout the paper because they are a natural and flexible application of $V$-statistics.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider optimization with relaxation, an ample paradigm to make data-driven designs. This approach was previously considered by the same authors of this work in Garatti and Campi (2019), a study that revealed a deep-seated connection between two concepts: risk (probability of not satisfying a new, out-of-sample, constraint) and complexity (according to a definition introduced in paper Garatti and Campi (2019)). This connection was shown to have profound implications in applications because it implied that the risk can be estimated from the complexity, a quantity that can be measured from the data without any knowledge of the data-generation mechanism. In the present work we establish new results. First, we expand the scope of Garatti and Campi (2019) so as to embrace a more general setup that covers various algorithms in machine learning. Then, we study classical support vector methods - including SVM (Support Vector Machine), SVR (Support Vector Regression) and SVDD (Support Vector Data Description) - and derive new results for the ability of these methods to generalize. All results are valid for any finite size of the data set. When the sample size tends to infinity, we establish the unprecedented result that the risk approaches the ratio between the complexity and the cardinality of the data sample, regardless of the value of the complexity.},

 abstract = {Trading off exploration and exploitation in an unknown environment is key to maximising expected online return during learning. A Bayes-optimal policy, which does so optimally, conditions its actions not only on the environment state but also on the agent's uncertainty about the environment. Computing a Bayes-optimal policy is however intractable for all but the smallest tasks. In this paper, we introduce variational Bayes-Adaptive Deep RL (variBAD), a way to meta-learn approximately Bayes-optimal policies for complex tasks. VariBAD simultaneously meta-learns a variational auto-encoder to perform approximate inference, and a policy that incorporates task uncertainty directly during action selection by conditioning on both the environment state and the approximate belief. In two toy domains, we illustrate how variBAD performs structured online exploration as a function of task uncertainty. We further evaluate variBAD on MuJoCo tasks widely used in meta-RL and show that it achieves higher online return than existing methods. On the recently proposed Meta-World ML1 benchmark, variBAD achieves state of the art results by a large margin, fully solving two out of the three ML1 tasks for the first time.},

We prove that FNOs are universal, in the sense that they can approximate any continuous operator to desired accuracy. Moreover, we suggest a mechanism by which FNOs can approximate operators associated with PDEs efficiently. Explicit error bounds are derived to show that the size of the FNO, approximating operators associated with a Darcy type elliptic PDE and with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics, only increases sub (log)-linearly in terms of the reciprocal of the error. Thus, FNOs are shown to efficiently approximate operators arising in a large class of PDEs.},
