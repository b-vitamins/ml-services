 abstract = {Policy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt a parameterized policy by following a performance gradient estimate. Many conventional policy gradient methods use Monte-Carlo techniques to estimate this gradient. The policy is improved by adjusting the parameters in the direction of the gradient estimate. Since Monte-Carlo methods tend to have high variance, a large number of samples is required to attain accurate estimates, resulting in slow convergence. In this paper, we first propose a Bayesian framework for policy gradient, based on modeling the policy gradient as a Gaussian process. This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. Moreover, estimates of the natural gradient as well as a measure of the uncertainty in the gradient estimates, namely, the gradient covariance, are provided at little extra cost. Since the proposed Bayesian framework considers system trajectories as its basic observable unit, it does not require the dynamics within trajectories to be of any particular form, and thus, can be easily extended to partially observable problems. On the downside, it cannot take advantage of the Markov property when the system is Markovian.

To address this issue, we proceed to supplement our Bayesian policy gradient framework with a new actor-critic learning model in which a Bayesian class of non-parametric critics, based on Gaussian process temporal difference learning, is used. Such critics model the action-value function as a Gaussian process, allowing Bayes' rule to be used in computing the posterior distribution over action-value functions, conditioned on the observed data. Appropriate choices of the policy parameterization and of the prior covariance (kernel) between action-values allow us to obtain closed-form expressions for the posterior distribution of the gradient of the expected return with respect to the policy parameters. We perform detailed experimental comparisons of the proposed Bayesian policy gradient and actor-critic algorithms with classic Monte-Carlo based policy gradient methods, as well as with each other, on a number of reinforcement learning problems.},

For this algorithm, we provide a full finite-sample analysis. Our results state a performance bound in terms of the number of policy improvement steps, the number of rollouts used in each iteration, the capacity of the considered policy space (classifier), and a capacity measure which indicates how well the policy space can approximate policies that are greedy with respect to any of its members. The analysis reveals a tradeoff between the estimation and approximation errors in this classification-based policy iteration setting. Furthermore it confirms the intuition that classification-based policy iteration algorithms could be favorably compared to value-based approaches when the policies can be approximated more easily than their corresponding value functions. We also study the consistency of the algorithm when there exists a sequence of policy spaces with increasing capacity.},

 abstract = {There is a widespread need for statistical methods that can analyze high-dimensional datasets with- out imposing restrictive or opaque modeling assumptions. This paper describes a domain-general data analysis method called CrossCat. CrossCat infers multiple non-overlapping views of the data, each consisting of a subset of the variables, and uses a separate nonparametric mixture to model each view. CrossCat is based on approximately Bayesian inference in a hierarchical, nonparamet- ric model for data tables. This model consists of a Dirichlet process mixture over the columns of a data table in which each mixture component is itself an independent Dirichlet process mixture over the rows; the inner mixture components are simple parametric models whose form depends on the types of data in the table. CrossCat combines strengths of mixture modeling and Bayesian net- work structure learning. Like mixture modeling, CrossCat can model a broad class of distributions by positing latent variables, and produces representations that can be efficiently conditioned and sampled from for prediction. Like Bayesian networks, CrossCat represents the dependencies and independencies between variables, and thus remains accurate when there are multiple statistical signals. Inference is done via a scalable Gibbs sampling scheme; this paper shows that it works well in practice. This paper also includes empirical results on heterogeneous tabular data of up to 10 million cells, such as hospital cost and quality measures, voting records, unemployment rates, gene expression measurements, and images of handwritten digits. CrossCat infers structure that is consistent with accepted findings and common-sense knowledge in multiple domains and yields predictive accuracy competitive with generative, discriminative, and model-free alternatives.},

Regularization provides a convenient way to control the complexity of the function space to which the estimated value function belongs and as a result enables us to work with rich nonparametric function spaces. We derive efficient implementations of our methods when the function space is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We analyze the statistical properties of REG-LSPI and provide an upper bound on the policy evaluation error and the performance loss of the policy returned by this method. Our bound shows the dependence of the loss on the number of samples, the capacity of the function space, and some intrinsic properties of the underlying Markov Decision Process. The dependence of the policy evaluation bound on the number of samples is minimax optimal.

 abstract = {Kernel-based reinforcement learning (KBRL) stands out among approximate reinforcement learning algorithms for its strong theoretical guarantees. By casting the learning problem as a local kernel approximation, KBRL provides a way of computing a decision policy which converges to a unique solution and is statistically consistent. Unfortunately, the model constructed by KBRL grows with the number of sample transitions, resulting in a computational cost that precludes its application to large-scale or on-line domains. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that turns KBRL into a practical reinforcement learning tool. Kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF) builds on a simple idea: when a transition probability matrix is represented as the product of two stochastic matrices, one can swap the factors of the multiplication to obtain another transition matrix, potentially much smaller than the original, which retains some fundamental properties of its precursor. KBSF exploits such an insight to compress the information contained in KBRL's model into an approximator of fixed size. This makes it possible to build an approximation considering both the difficulty of the problem and the associated computational cost. KBSF's computational complexity is linear in the number of sample transitions, which is the best one can do without discarding data. Moreover, the algorithm's simple mechanics allow for a fully incremental implementation that makes the amount of memory used independent of the number of sample transitions. The result is a kernel-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can be applied to large-scale problems in both off-line and on-line regimes. We derive upper bounds for the distance between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF using the same data. We also prove that it is possible to control the magnitude of the variables appearing in our bounds, which means that, given enough computational resources, we can make KBSF's value function as close as desired to the value function that would be computed by KBRL using the same set of sample transitions. The potential of our algorithm is demonstrated in an extensive empirical study in which KBSF is applied to difficult tasks based on real-world data. Not only does KBSF solve problems that had never been solved before, but it also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms on the tasks studied.},

Under a exible problem setup, we establish asymptotic strong consistency and perform a finite-time regret analysis for a sequential randomized allocation strategy based on kernel estimation. In addition, since many nonparametric and parametric methods in supervised learning may be applied to estimating the mean reward functions but guidance on how to choose among them is generally unavailable, we propose a model combining allocation strategy for adaptive performance.

In this paper we describe the objective function for nested learning and inference in conditional random fields. The devised objective maximizes the log-beliefs -- probability distributions over subsets of training variables that agree on their marginal probabilities. This objective is concave and consists of two types of variables that are related to the learning and inference tasks respectively. Importantly, we afterwards show how to blend the learning and inference procedure and effectively get to the identical optimum much faster.

 abstract = {In regression problems over Rd, the unknown function f often varies more in some coordinates than in others. We show that weighting each coordinate i according to an estimate of the variation of f along coordinate i - e.g. the L1 norm of the ith-directional derivative of f - is an efficient way to significantly improve the performance of distance-based regressors such as kernel and k- NN regressors. The approach, termed Gradient Weighting (GW), consists of a first pass regression estimate fn which serves to evaluate the directional derivatives of f, and a second-pass regression estimate on the re-weighted data. The GW approach can be instantiated for both regression and classification, and is grounded in strong theoretical principles having to do with the way regression bias and variance are affected by a generic feature-weighting scheme. These theoretical principles provide further technical foundation for some existing feature-weighting heuristics that have proved successful in practice.

We propose a simple estimator of these derivative norms and prove its consistency. The proposed estimator computes efficiently and easily extends to run online. We then derive a classification version of the GW approach which evaluates on real-worlds datasets with as much success as its regression counterpart.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of high-dimensional regression when there may be interacting variables. Approaches using sparsity-inducing penalty functions such as the Lasso can be useful for producing interpretable models. However, when the number variables runs into the thousands, and so even two-way interactions number in the millions, these methods may become computationally infeasible. Typically variable screening based on model fits using only main effects must be performed first. One problem with screening is that important variables may be missed if they are only useful for prediction when certain interaction terms are also present in the model.

To tackle this issue, we introduce a new method we call Backtracking. It can be incorporated into many existing high-dimensional methods based on penalty functions, and works by building increasing sets of candidate interactions iteratively. Models fitted on the main effects and interactions selected early on in this process guide the selection of future interactions. By also making use of previous fits for computation, as well as performing calculations is parallel, the overall run-time of the algorithm can be greatly reduced.

The effectiveness of our method when applied to regression and classification problems is demonstrated on simulated and real data sets. In the case of using Backtracking with the Lasso, we also give some theoretical support for our procedure.},

The adaptive regret of an algorithm on a time interval [t 1,t 2] is the loss of the algorithm there minus the loss of the best expert. Adaptive regret measures how well the algorithm approximates the best expert locally, and it is therefore somewhere between the classical regret (measured on all outcomes) and the tracking regret, where the algorithm is compared to a good sequence of experts. We investigate two existing intuitive methods to derive algorithms with low adaptive regret, one based on specialist experts and the other based on restarts. Quite surprisingly, we show that both methods lead to the same algorithm, namely Fixed Share, which is known for its tracking regret. Our main result is a thorough analysis of the adaptive regret of Fixed Share. We obtain the exact worst-case adaptive regret for Fixed Share, from which the classical tracking bounds can be derived. We also prove that Fixed Share is optimal, in the sense that no algorithm can have a better adaptive regret bound.},

In this variant, an agent is given a collection of example traces produced by a reference policy, which may, for example, capture the agent's past behavior. The agent is (only) asked to find policies that are supported by regularities in the dynamics that are observable on these example traces. We describe an efficient algorithm that uses such common knowledge reflected in the example traces to construct decision tree policies for goal-oriented factored POMDPs. More precisely, our algorithm (provably) succeeds at finding policy for a given input goal when (1) there is a CNF that is almost always observed satisfied on the traces of the POMDP, capturing a sufficient approximation of its dynamics and (2) for a decision tree policy of bounded complexity, there exist small-space resolution proofs that the goal is achieved on each branch using the aforementioned CNF capturing the common sense rules. Such a CNF always exists for noisy STRIPS domains, for example. Our results thus essentially establish that the possession of a suitable exploration policy for collecting the necessary examples is the fundamental obstacle to learning to act in such environments.},

To address this issue, several approaches that train SVMs on many small chunks separately have been proposed in the literature. With the exception of random chunks, which is also known as divide-and-conquer kernel ridge regression, however, these approaches have only been empirically investigated. In this work we investigate a spatially oriented method to generate the chunks. For the resulting localized SVM that uses Gaussian kernels and the least squares loss we derive an oracle inequality, which in turn is used to deduce learning rates that are essentially minimax optimal under some standard smoothness assumptions on the regression function. In addition, we derive local learning rates that are based on the local smoothness of the regression function. We further introduce a data-dependent parameter selection method for our local SVM approach and show that this method achieves the same almost optimal learning rates. Finally, we present a few larger scale experiments for our localized SVM showing that it achieves essentially the same test error as a global SVM for a fraction of the computational requirements. In addition, it turns out that the computational requirements for the local SVMs are similar to those of a vanilla random chunk approach, while the achieved test errors are significantly better.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a new framework for large scale online kernel learning, making kernel methods efficient and scalable for large-scale online learning applications. Unlike the regular budget online kernel learning scheme that usually uses some budget maintenance strategies to bound the number of support vectors, our framework explores a completely different approach of kernel functional approximation techniques to make the subsequent online learning task efficient and scalable. Specifically, we present two different online kernel machine learning algorithms: (i) Fourier Online Gradient Descent (FOGD) algorithm that applies the random Fourier features for approximating kernel functions; and (ii) Nystrom Online Gradient Descent (NOGD) algorithm that applies the Nystrom method to approximate large kernel matrices. We explore these two approaches to tackle three online learning tasks: binary classification, multi-class classification, and regression. The encouraging results of our experiments on large-scale datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms, making them potentially more practical than the family of existing budget online kernel learning approaches.},

 abstract = {Stable random variables are motivated by the central limit theorem for densities with (potentially) unbounded variance and can be thought of as natural generalizations of the Gaussian distribution to skewed and heavy-tailed phenomenon. In this paper, we introduce α-stable graphical (α-SG) models, a class of multivariate stable densities that can also be represented as Bayesian networks whose edges encode linear dependencies between random variables. One major hurdle to the extensive use of stable distributions is the lack of a closed-form analytical expression for their densities. This makes penalized maximum-likelihood based learning computationally demanding. We establish theoretically that the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can asymptotically be reduced to the computationally more tractable minimum dispersion criterion (MDC) and develop StabLe, a structure learning algorithm based on MDC. We use simulated datasets for five benchmark network topologies to empirically demonstrate how StabLe improves upon ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. We also apply StabLe to microarray gene expression data for lymphoblastoid cells from 727 individuals belonging to eight global population groups. We establish that StabLe improves test set performance relative to OLS via ten-fold cross-validation. Finally, we develop SGEX, a method for quantifying di_erential expression of genes between di_erent population groups.},

 abstract = {A mean function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), or a kernel mean, is central to kernel methods in that it is used by many classical algorithms such as kernel principal component analysis, and it also forms the core inference step of modern kernel methods that rely on embedding probability distributions in RKHSs. Given a finite sample, an empirical average has been used commonly as a standard estimator of the true kernel mean. Despite a widespread use of this estimator, we show that it can be improved thanks to the well-known Stein phenomenon. We propose a new family of estimators called kernel mean shrinkage estimators (KMSEs), which benefit from both theoretical justifications and good empirical performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard one, especially in a large d, small n paradigm.},

 abstract = {Symmetric positive semidefinite (SPSD) matrix approximation is an important problem with applications in kernel methods. However, existing SPSD matrix approximation methods such as the Nystrom method only have weak error bounds. In this paper we conduct in-depth studies of an SPSD matrix approximation model and establish strong relative-error bounds. We call it the prototype model for it has more efficient and effective extensions, and some of its extensions have high scalability. Though the prototype model itself is not suitable for large-scale data, it is still useful to study its properties, on which the analysis of its extensions relies.

This paper offers novel theoretical analysis, efficient algorithms, and a highly accurate extension. First, we establish a lower error bound for the prototype model and improve the error bound of an existing column selection algorithm to match the lower bound. In this way, we obtain the first optimal column selection algorithm for the prototype model. We also prove that the prototype model is exact under certain conditions. Second, we develop a simple column selection algorithm with a provable error bound. Third, we propose a so-called spectral shifting model to make the approximation more accurate when the eigenvalues of the matrix decay slowly, and the improvement is theoretically quantified. The spectral shifting method can also be applied to improve other SPSD matrix approximation models.},

This bound provides an explanation to several empirical results reported in the literature, related to the performance of flat and hierarchical classifiers. Based on this bound, we also propose a technique for modifying a given taxonomy through pruning, that leads to a lower value of the upper bound as compared to the original taxonomy. We then present another method for hierarchy pruning by studying approximation error of a family of classifiers, and derive from it features used in a meta-classifier to decide which nodes to prune.

More importantly, it enables us to investigate asymptotic scenarios that have not been considered before, and gain new insights into the consistency, subspace consistency and strong inconsistency regions of PCA and the boundaries among them. We also establish the corresponding convergence rate within each region. Under general spike covariance models, the dimension (or the number of variables) discourages the consistency of PCA, while the sample size and spike information (the relative size of the population eigenvalues) encourages PCA consistency. Our framework nicely illustrates the relationship among these three types of information in terms of dimension, sample size and spike size, and rigorously characterizes how their relationships affect PCA consistency.},

If the sample size n is massive, a common strategy is to partition the feature space, and then separately apply simple models to each partition set. This is not ideal when n is modest relative to p, and we propose an alternative approach relying on random compression of the feature vector combined with Gaussian process regression. The proposed approach is particularly motivated by the setting in which the response is conditionally independent of the features given the projection to a low dimensional manifold. Conditionally on the random compression matrix and a smoothness parameter, the posterior distribution for the regression surface and posterior predictive distributions are available analytically. Running the analysis in parallel for many random compression matrices and smoothness parameters, model averaging is used to combine the results. The algorithm can be implemented rapidly even in very large p and moderately large n nonparametric regression, has strong theoretical justification, and is found to yield state of the art predictive performance.},

Our study focuses on the properties of the statistical risk for bipartite ranking with general losses, which is closely related to a generalised notion of the area under the ROC curve: we establish alternate representations of this risk, relate the Bayes-optimal risk to a class of probability divergences, and characterise the set of Bayes-optimal scorers for the risk. We further study properties of a generalised class of bipartite risks, based on the p-norm push of Rudin (2009). Our analysis is based on the rich framework of proper losses, which are the central tool in the study of class-probability estimation. We show how this analytic tool makes transparent the generalisations of several existing results, such as the equivalence of the minimisers for four seemingly disparate risks from bipartite ranking and class-probability estimation. A novel practical implication of our analysis is the design of new families of losses for scenarios where accuracy at the head of ranked list is paramount, with comparable empirical performance to the p-norm push.},

The goal is to provide theoretical grounds for choosing V in order to minimize the least-squares loss of the selected estimator. We first prove a non-asymptotic oracle inequality for V-fold cross-validation and its bias-corrected version (V-fold penalization). In particular, this result implies that V-fold penalization is asymptotically optimal in the nonparametric case. Then, we compute the variance of V-fold cross-validation and related criteria, as well as the variance of key quantities for model selection performance. We show that these variances depend on V like 1+4/(V-1), at least in some particular cases, suggesting that the performance increases much from V=2 to V=5 or 10, and then is almost constant. Overall, this can explain the common advice to take V=5---at least in our setting and when the computational power is limited---, as supported by some simulation experiments. An oracle inequality and exact formulas for the variance are also proved for Monte-Carlo cross-validation, also known as repeated cross-validation, where the parameter V is replaced by the number B of random splits of the data.},

 abstract = {Accurate classification of categorical outcomes is essential in a wide range of applications. Due to computational issues with minimizing the empirical 0/1 loss, Fisher consistent losses have been proposed as viable proxies. However, even with smooth losses, direct minimization remains a daunting task. To approximate such a minimizer, various boosting algorithms have been suggested. For example, with exponential loss, the AdaBoost algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1995) is widely used for two-class problems and has been extended to the multi-class setting (Zhu et al., 2009). Alternative loss functions, such as the logistic and the hinge losses, and their corresponding boosting algorithms have also been proposed (Zou et al., 2008; Wang, 2012). In this paper we demonstrate that a broad class of losses, including non-convex functions, achieve Fisher consistency, and in addition can be used for explicit estimation of the conditional class probabilities. Furthermore, we provide a generic boosting algorithm that is not loss-specific. Extensive simulation results suggest that the proposed boosting algorithms could outperform existing methods with properly chosen losses and bags of weak learners.},

We derive both upper and lower bounds on this quantity, and use these results to analyze various loss matrices.

 abstract = {We consider two closely related problems: planted clustering and submatrix localization. The planted clustering problem assumes that a random graph is generated based on some underlying clusters of the nodes; the task is to recover these clusters given the graph. The submatrix localization problem concerns locating hidden submatrices with elevated means inside a large real-valued random matrix. Of particular interest is the setting where the number of clusters/submatrices is allowed to grow unbounded with the problem size. These formulations cover several classical models such as planted clique, planted densest subgraph, planted partition, planted coloring, and stochastic block model, which are widely used for studying community detection and clustering/bi-clustering. For both problems, we show that the space of the model parameters (cluster/submatrix size, cluster density, and submatrix mean) can be partitioned into four disjoint regions corresponding to decreasing statistical and computational complexities: (1) the \emph{impossible} regime, where all algorithms fail; (2) the \emph{hard} regime, where the computationally expensive Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) succeeds; (3) the \emph{easy} regime, where the polynomial-time convexified MLE succeeds; (4) the \emph{simple} regime, where a simple counting/thresholding procedure succeeds. Moreover, we show that each of these algorithms provably fails in the previous harder regimes. Our theorems establish the minimax recovery limit, which are tight up to constants and hold with a growing number of clusters/submatrices, and provide a stronger performance guarantee than previously known for polynomial-time algorithms. Our study demonstrates the tradeoffs between statistical and computational considerations, and suggests that the minimax recovery limit may not be achievable by polynomial-time algorithms.},

The approach presented in this paper builds on interval analysis and attempts to define bounds in the search space prior to applying a global search algorithm for training an MLP. These bounds depend on the machine precision and the term guaranteed denotes that the region defined surely encloses weight sets that are global minimizers of the neural network's error function. Although the solution set to the bounding problem for an MLP is in general non-convex, the paper presents the theoretical results that help deriving a box which is a convex set. This box is an outer approximation of the algebraic solutions to the interval equations resulting from the function implemented by the network nodes. An experimental study using well known benchmarks is presented in accordance with the theoretical results.},

Assuming that the causes and the effects have the same distribution, we show that the distribution of the residuals of a linear fit in the anti-causal direction is closer to a Gaussian than the distribution of the residuals in the causal direction. This Gaussianization effect is characterized by reduction of the magnitude of the high-order cumulants and by an increment of the differential entropy of the residuals. The problem of non-linear causal inference is addressed by performing an embedding in an expanded feature space, in which the relation between causes and effects can be assumed to be linear. The effectiveness of a method to discriminate between causes and effects based on this type of asymmetry is illustrated in a variety of experiments using different measures of Gaussianity.

 abstract = {The instrumental variable method consistently estimates the effect of a treatment when there is unmeasured confounding and a valid instrumental variable. A valid instrumental variable is a variable that is independent of unmeasured confounders and affects the treatment but does not have a direct effect on the outcome beyond its effect on the treatment. Two commonly used estimators for using an instrumental variable to estimate a treatment effect are the two stage least squares estimator and the control function estimator. For linear causal effect models, these two estimators are equivalent, but for nonlinear causal effect models, the estimators are different. We provide a systematic comparison of these two estimators for nonlinear causal effect models and develop an approach to combing the two estimators that generally performs better than either one alone. We show that the control function estimator is a two stage least squares estimator with an augmented set of instrumental variables. If these augmented instrumental variables are valid, then the control function estimator can be much more efficient than usual two stage least squares without the augmented instrumental variables while if the augmented instrumental variables are not valid, then the control function estimator may be inconsistent while the usual two stage least squares remains consistent. We apply the Hausman test to test whether the augmented instrumental variables are valid and construct a pretest estimator based on this test. The pretest estimator is shown to work well in a simulation study. An application to the effect of exposure to violence on time preference is considered.},

 abstract = {In the past few years, differential privacy has become a standard concept in the area of privacy. One of the most important problems in this field is to answer queries while preserving differential privacy. In spite of extensive studies, most existing work on differentially private query answering assumes the data are discrete (i.e., in {0; 1}d) and focuses on queries induced by Boolean functions. In real applications however, continuous data are at least as common as binary data. Thus, in this work we explore a less studied topic, namely, differential privately query answering for continuous data with continuous function. As a first step towards the continuous case, we study a natural class of linear queries on continuous data which we refer to as smooth queries. A linear query is said to be K-smooth if it is specified by a function defined on [-1; 1]d whose partial derivatives up to order K are all bounded. We develop two e-differentially private mechanisms which are able to answer all smooth queries. The first mechanism outputs a summary of the database and can then give answers to the queries. The second mechanism is an improvement of the first one and it outputs a synthetic database. The two mechanisms both achieve an accuracy of O(n-K/2d+K/e). Here we assume that the dimension d is a constant. It turns out that even in this parameter setting (which is almost trivial in the discrete case), using existing discrete mechanisms to answer the smooth queries is difficult and requires more noise. Our mechanisms are based on L∞-approximation of (transformed) smooth functions by low-degree even trigonometric polynomials with uniformly bounded coefficients. We also develop practically efficient variants of the mechanisms with promising experimental results.},

 abstract = {Identification of latent variables that govern a problem and the relationships among them, given measurements in the observed world, are important for causal discovery. This identification can be accomplished by analyzing the constraints imposed by the latents in the measurements. We introduce the concept of pairwise cluster comparison (PCC) to identify causal relationships from clusters of data points and provide a two-stage algorithm called learning PCC (LPCC) that learns a latent variable model (LVM) using PCC. First, LPCC learns exogenous latents and latent colliders, as well as their observed descendants, by using pairwise comparisons between data clusters in the measurement space that may explain latent causes. Since in this first stage LPCC cannot distinguish endogenous latent non-colliders from their exogenous ancestors, a second stage is needed to extract the former, with their observed children, from the latter. If the true graph has no serial connections, LPCC returns the true graph, and if the true graph has a serial connection, LPCC returns a pattern of the true graph. LPCC's most important advantage is that it is not limited to linear or latent-tree models and makes only mild assumptions about the distribution. The paper is divided in two parts: Part I (this paper) provides the necessary preliminaries, theoretical foundation to PCC, and an overview of LPCC; Part II formally introduces the LPCC algorithm and experimentally evaluates its merit in different synthetic and real domains. The code for the LPCC algorithm and data sets used in the experiments reported in Part II are available online.},

Can we recover the hidden network structures from these observed cascades? What kind of cascades and how many cascades do we need? Are there some network structures which are more difficult than others to recover? Can we design efficient inference algorithms with provable guarantees?

Despite the increasing availability of cascade-data and methods for inferring networks from these data, a thorough theoretical understanding of the above questions remains largely unexplored in the literature. In this paper, we investigate the network structure inference problem for a general family of continuous-time diffusion models using an l1-regularized likelihood maximization framework. We show that, as long as the cascade sampling process satisfies a natural incoherence condition, our framework can recover the correct network structure with high probability if we observe O(d3 log N) cascades, where d is the maximum number of parents of a node and N is the total number of nodes. Moreover, we develop a simple and efficient soft-thresholding inference algorithm, which we use to illustrate the consequences of our theoretical results, and show that our framework outperforms other alternatives in practice.},

 abstract = {In high-dimensional data, structured noise caused by observed and unobserved factors affecting multiple target variables simultaneously, imposes a serious challenge for modeling, by masking the often weak signal. Therefore, (1) explaining away the structured noise in multiple-output regression is of paramount importance. Additionally, (2) assumptions about the correlation structure of the regression weights are needed. We note that both can be formulated in a natural way in a latent variable model, in which both the interesting signal and the noise are mediated through the same latent factors. Under this assumption, the signal model then borrows strength from the noise model by encouraging similar effects on correlated targets. We introduce a hyperparameter for the latent signal-to-noise ratio which turns out to be important for modelling weak signals, and an ordered infinite-dimensional shrinkage prior that resolves the rotational unidentifiability in reduced-rank regression models. Simulations and prediction experiments with metabolite, gene expression, FMRI measurement, and macroeconomic time series data show that our model equals or exceeds the state-of-the-art performance and, in particular, outperforms the standard approach of assuming independent noise and signal models.},

The partition size matters, and the optimal partition size is data dependent. While for detecting simple relationships coarse partitions may be best, for detecting complex relationships a great gain in power can be achieved by considering finer partitions. We suggest novel consistent distribution-free tests that are based on summation or maximization aggregation of scores over all partitions of a fixed size. We show that our test statistics based on summation can serve as good estimators of the mutual information. Moreover, we suggest regularized tests that aggregate over all partition sizes, and prove those are consistent too. We provide polynomial-time algorithms, which are critical for computing the suggested test statistics efficiently. We show that the power of the regularized tests is excellent compared to existing tests, and almost as powerful as the tests based on the optimal (yet unknown in practice) partition size, in simulations as well as on a real data example.},

We prove that the path-sum formulation always exists for models whose covariance matrix is positive definite: i.e. it is valid for both walk-summable and non-walk-summable graphical models of arbitrary topology. We show that for graphical models on trees the path-sum formulation is equivalent to Gaussian belief propagation.

We show that the path-sum formulation formulation is valid for arbitrary partitions of the inverse covariance matrix. We give detailed examples demonstrating our results.},

 abstract = {In this paper we analyze the relationship between faithfulness and the more recent condition of algorithmic Independence of Conditionals (IC) with respect to the Conditional Independencies (CIs) they allow. Both conditions have been extensively used for causal inference by refuting factorizations for which the condition does not hold. Violation of faithfulness happens when there are CIs that do not follow from the Markov condition. For those CIs, non-trivial constraints among some parameters of the Conditional Probability Distributions (CPDs) must hold. When such a constraint is defined over parameters of different CPDs, we prove that IC is also violated unless the parameters have a simple description. To understand which non-Markovian CIs are permitted we define a new condition closely related to IC: the Independence from Product Constraints (IPC). The condition reflects that CIs might be the result of specific parameterizations of individual CPDs but not from constraints on parameters of different CPDs. In that sense it is more restrictive than IC: parameters may have a simple description. On the other hand, IC also excludes other forms of algorithmic dependencies between CPDs. Finally, we prove that on top of the CIs permitted by the Markov condition (faithfulness), IPC allows non-minimality, deterministic relations and what we called proportional CPDs. These are the only cases in which a CI follows from a specific parameterization of a single CPD.},

The quality of a least-squares approximation can be assessed in different ways: either in terms of the value of the quadratic objective function (cost approximation), or in terms of some distance measure between the approximate minimizer and the true minimizer (solution approximation). Focusing on the latter criterion, our first main result provides a general lower bound on any randomized method that sketches both the data matrix and vector in a least-squares problem; as a surprising consequence, the most widely used least-squares sketch is sub-optimal for solution approximation. We then present a new method known as the iterative Hessian sketch, and show that it can be used to obtain approximations to the original least-squares problem using a projection dimension proportional to the statistical complexity of the least-squares minimizer, and a logarithmic number of iterations. We illustrate our general theory with simulations for both unconstrained and constrained versions of least-squares, including l1-regularization and nuclear norm constraints. We also numerically demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a real face expression classification experiment.},

 abstract = {Latent factor models are the canonical statistical tool for exploratory analyses of low-dimensional linear structure for a matrix of p features across n samples. We develop a structured Bayesian group factor analysis model that extends the factor model to multiple coupled observation matrices; in the case of two observations, this reduces to a Bayesian model of canonical correlation analysis. Here, we carefully define a structured Bayesian prior that encourages both element-wise and column-wise shrinkage and leads to desirable behavior on high-dimensional data. In particular, our model puts a structured prior on the joint factor loading matrix, regularizing at three levels, which enables element-wise sparsity and unsupervised recovery of latent factors corresponding to structured variance across arbitrary subsets of the observations. In addition, our structured prior allows for both dense and sparse latent factors so that covariation among either all features or only a subset of features can be recovered. We use fast parameter-expanded expectation-maximization for parameter estimation in this model. We validate our method on simulated data with substantial structure. We show results of our method applied to three high-dimensional data sets, comparing results against a number of state-of-the-art approaches. These results illustrate useful properties of our model, including i) recovering sparse signal in the presence of dense effects; ii) the ability to scale naturally to large numbers of observations; iii) flexible observation- and factor-specific regularization to recover factors with a wide variety of sparsity levels and percentage of variance explained; and iv) tractable inference that scales to modern genomic and text data sizes.},

 abstract = {Learning probabilistic models over strings is an important issue for many applications. Spectral methods propose elegant solutions to the problem of inferring weighted automata from finite samples of variable-length strings drawn from an unknown target distribution. These methods rely on a singular value decomposition of a matrix $H_S$, called the Hankel matrix, that records the frequencies of (some of) the observed strings. The accuracy of the learned distribution depends both on the quantity of information embedded in $H_S$ and on the distance between $H_S$ and its mean $H_r$. Existing concentration bounds seem to indicate that the concentration over $H_r$ gets looser with the size of $H_r$, suggesting to make a trade-off between the quantity of used information and the size of $H_r$. We propose new dimension-free concentration bounds for several variants of Hankel matrices. Experiments demonstrate that these bounds are tight and that they significantly improve existing bounds.

 abstract = {We focus on the distribution regression problem: regressing to vector-valued outputs from probability measures. Many important machine learning and statistical tasks fit into this framework, including multi-instance learning and point estimation problems without analytical solution (such as hyperparameter or entropy estimation). Despite the large number of available heuristics in the literature, the inherent two-stage sampled nature of the problem makes the theoretical analysis quite challenging, since in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and the estimates have to rely on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing technique with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which often performs poorly in practice), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we study a simple, analytically computable, ridge regression-based alternative to distribution regression, where we embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn the regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove that this scheme is consistent in the two-stage sampled setup under mild conditions (on separable topological domains enriched with kernels): we present an exact computational-statistical efficiency trade-off analysis showing that our estimator is able to match the one-stage sampled minimax optimal rate (Caponnetto and De Vito, 2007; Steinwart et al., 2009). This result answers a 17-year-old open question, establishing the consistency of the classical set kernel (Haussler, 1999; Gartner et al., 2002) in regression. We also cover consistency for more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to Christmann and Steinwart (2010).},

 abstract = {Crowdsourcing is a popular paradigm for effectively collecting labels at low cost. The Dawid-Skene estimator has been widely used for inferring the true labels from the noisy labels provided by non-expert crowdsourcing workers. However, since the estimator maximizes a non-convex log-likelihood function, it is hard to theoretically justify its performance. In this paper, we propose a two-stage efficient algorithm for multi-class crowd labeling problems. The first stage uses the spectral method to obtain an initial estimate of parameters. Then the second stage refines the estimation by optimizing the objective function of the Dawid-Skene estimator via the EM algorithm. We show that our algorithm achieves the optimal convergence rate up to a logarithmic factor. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is comparable to the most accurate empirical approach, while outperforming several other recently proposed methods.},

Existing results show that it can recover sparse signals mimicking the accuracy of the ideal procedure, up to a logarithmic factor of the dimensionality. Such a factor has been shown to hold for many regularization methods. An important question is whether this factor can be reduced to a logarithmic factor of the sample size in ultra-high dimensions under mild regularity conditions. To provide an affirmative answer, in this paper we suggest the constrained Dantzig selector, which has more flexible constraints and parameter space. We prove that the suggested method can achieve convergence rates within a logarithmic factor of the sample size of the oracle rates and improved sparsity, under a fairly weak assumption on the signal strength. Such improvement is significant in ultra-high dimensions. This method can be implemented efficiently through sequential linear programming. Numerical studies confirm that the sample size needed for a certain level of accuracy in these problems can be much reduced.},

 abstract = {The discovery of causal relationships from purely observational data is a fundamental problem in science. The most elementary form of such a causal discovery problem is to decide whether X causes Y or, alternatively, Y causes X, given joint observations of two variables X,Y. An example is to decide whether altitude causes temperature, or vice versa, given only joint measurements of both variables. Even under the simplifying assumptions of no confounding, no feedback loops, and no selection bias, such bivariate causal discovery problems are challenging. Nevertheless, several approaches for addressing those problems have been proposed in recent years. We review two families of such methods: methods based on Additive Noise Models (ANMs) and Information Geometric Causal Inference (IGCI). We present the benchmark CAUSEEFFECTPAIRS that consists of data for 100 different causee ffect pairs selected from 37 data sets from various domains (e.g., meteorology, biology, medicine, engineering, economy, etc.) and motivate our decisions regarding the ground truth causal directions of all pairs. We evaluate the performance of several bivariate causal discovery methods on these real-world benchmark data and in addition on artificially simulated data. Our empirical results on real-world data indicate that certain methods are indeed able to distinguish cause from effect using only purely observational data, although more benchmark data would be needed to obtain statistically significant conclusions. One of the best performing methods overall is the method based on Additive Noise Models that has originally been proposed by Hoyer et al. (2009), which obtains an accuracy of 63 ± 10 % and an AUC of 0.74 ± 0.05 on the real-world benchmark. As the main theoretical contribution of this work we prove the consistency of that method.},

Additionally, several different weightings of the misclassification errors are incorporated in the loss function, such that it generalizes three existing multiclass SVMs through a single optimization problem. An iterative majorization algorithm is derived that solves the optimization problem without the need of a dual formulation. This algorithm has the advantage that it can use warm starts during cross validation and during a grid search, which significantly speeds up the training phase. Rigorous numerical experiments compare linear GenSVM with seven existing multiclass SVMs on both small and large data sets. These comparisons show that the proposed method is competitive with existing methods in both predictive accuracy and training time, and that it significantly outperforms several existing methods on these criteria.},

In the simplest case, with an isotropic noise model, our method is equivalent to a classical singular value shrinkage estimator. For non-isotropic noise models--e.g., Poisson noise-- the method does not reduce to singular value shrinkage, and instead yields new estimators that perform well in experiments. Moreover, by iterating our stable autoencoding scheme, we can automatically generate low-rank estimates without specifying the target rank as a tuning parameter.},

Secondarily, we evaluate the accuracy of the Laplace and EP approximations themselves against a ground truth established through extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation.

 abstract = {In a wide range of statistical learning problems such as ranking, clustering or metric learning among others, the risk is accurately estimated by U-statistics of degree d ≥ 1, i.e. functionals of the training data with low variance that take the form of averages over k-tuples. From a computational perspective, the calculation of such statistics is highly expensive even for a moderate sample size n, as it requires averaging O(nd) terms. This makes learning procedures relying on the optimization of such data functionals hardly feasible in practice. It is the major goal of this paper to show that, strikingly, such empirical risks can be replaced by drastically computationally simpler Monte-Carlo estimates based on O(n) terms only, usually referred to as incomplete U-statistics, without damaging the OP(1/√n) learning rate of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) procedures. For this purpose, we establish uniform deviation results describing the error made when approximating a U-process by its incomplete version under appropriate complexity assumptions. Extensions to model selection, fast rate situations and various sampling techniques are also considered, as well as an application to stochastic gradient descent for ERM. Finally, numerical examples are displayed in order to provide strong empirical evidence that the approach we promote largely surpasses more naive subsampling techniques.},

 abstract = {Our paper deals with inferring simulator-based statistical models given some observed data. A simulator-based model is a parametrized mechanism which specifies how data are generated. It is thus also referred to as generative model. We assume that only a finite number of parameters are of interest and allow the generative process to be very general; it may be a noisy nonlinear dynamical system with an unrestricted number of hidden variables. This weak assumption is useful for devising realistic models but it renders statistical inference very difficult. The main challenge is the intractability of the likelihood function. Several likelihood-free inference methods have been proposed which share the basic idea of identifying the parameters by finding values for which the discrepancy between simulated and observed data is small. A major obstacle to using these methods is their computational cost. The cost is largely due to the need to repeatedly simulate data sets and the lack of knowledge about how the parameters affect the discrepancy. We propose a strategy which combines probabilistic modeling of the discrepancy with optimization to facilitate likelihood-free inference. The strategy is implemented using Bayesian optimization and is shown to accelerate the inference through a reduction in the number of required simulations by several orders of magnitude.},

 abstract = {Local differential privacy has recently surfaced as a strong measure of privacy in contexts where personal information remains private even from data analysts. Working in a setting where both the data providers and data analysts want to maximize the utility of statistical analyses performed on the released data, we study the fundamental trade-off between local differential privacy and utility. This trade-off is formulated as a constrained optimization problem: maximize utility subject to local differential privacy constraints. We introduce a combinatorial family of extremal privatization mechanisms, which we call staircase mechanisms, and show that it contains the optimal privatization mechanisms for a broad class of information theoretic utilities such as mutual information and $f$-divergences. We further prove that for any utility function and any privacy level, solving the privacy-utility maximization problem is equivalent to solving a finite-dimensional linear program, the outcome of which is the optimal staircase mechanism. However, solving this linear program can be computationally expensive since it has a number of variables that is exponential in the size of the alphabet the data lives in. To account for this, we show that two simple privatization mechanisms, the binary and randomized response mechanisms, are universally optimal in the low and high privacy regimes, and well approximate the intermediate regime.},

 abstract = {We present methods based on Metropolis-coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC3) and annealed importance sampling (AIS) for estimating the posterior distribution of Bayesian networks. The methods draw samples from an appropriate distribution of partial orders on the nodes, continued by sampling directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) conditionally on the sampled partial orders. We show that the computations needed for the sampling algorithms are feasible as long as the encountered partial orders have relatively few down-sets. While the algorithms assume suitable modularity properties of the priors, arbitrary priors can be handled by dividing the importance weight of each sampled DAG by the number of topological sorts it has|we give a practical dynamic programming algorithm to compute these numbers. Our empirical results demonstrate that the presented partial-order-based samplers are superior to previous Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which sample DAGs either directly or via linear orders on the nodes. The results also suggest that the convergence rate of the estimators based on AIS are competitive to those of MC3. Thus AIS is the preferred method, as it enables easier large-scale parallelization and, in addition, supplies good probabilistic lower bound guarantees for the marginal likelihood of the model.},

However, many existing probabilistic network models are difficult or impossible to deploy at these massive scales. We propose a scalable approach for modeling and inferring latent spaces in Internet-scale networks, with an eye towards overlapping community detection as a key application. By applying a succinct representation of networks as a bag of triangular motifs, developing a parsimonious statistical model, deriving an efficient stochastic variational inference algorithm, and implementing it as a distributed cluster program via the Petuum parameter server system, we demonstrate overlapping community detection on real networks with up to 100 million nodes and 1000 communities on 5 machines in under 40 hours. Compared to other state-of-the-art probabilistic network approaches, our method is several orders of magnitude faster, with competitive or improved accuracy at overlapping community detection.},

 abstract = {Parallel processing frameworks (Dean and Ghemawat, 2004) accelerate jobs by breaking them into tasks that execute in parallel. However, slow running or straggler tasks can run up to 8 times slower than the median task on a production cluster (Ananthanarayanan et al., 2013), leading to delayed job completion and inefficient use of resources. Existing straggler mitigation techniques wait to detect stragglers and then relaunch them, delaying straggler detection and wasting resources. We built Wrangler (Yadwadkar et al., 2014), a system that predicts when stragglers are going to occur and makes scheduling decisions to avoid such situations. To capture node and workload variability, Wrangler built separate models for every node and workload, requiring the time-consuming collection of substantial training data. In this paper, we propose multi-task learning formulations that share information between the various models, allowing us to use less training data and bring training time down from 4 hours to 40 minutes. Unlike naive multi-task learning formulations, our formulations capture the shared structure in our data, improving generalization performance on limited data. Finally, we extend these formulations using group sparsity inducing norms to automatically discover the similarities between tasks and improve interpretability.},

In particular, we assume here that the principal components v1,..., vr have at most k1, · · · , kq non-zero entries respectively, and study the high-dimensional regime in which p is of the same order as n.

In an influential paper, Johnstone and Lu [JL04] introduced a simple algorithm that estimates the support of the principal vectors v1,..., vr by the largest entries in the diagonal of the empirical covariance. This method can be shown to succeed with high probability if kq ≤ C1 √n/ log p, and to fail with high probability if kq ≥ C2 √n/ log p for two constants 0 < C1, C2 < ∞. Despite a considerable amount of work over the last ten years, no practical algorithm exists with provably better support recovery guarantees.

Here we analyze a covariance thresholding algorithm that was recently proposed by Krauthgamer, Nadler and Vilenchik [KNV13]. We confirm empirical evidence presented by these authors and rigorously prove that the algorithm succeeds with high probability for k of order √n. Recent conditional lower bounds [BR13] suggest that it might be impossible to do significantly better.

The goal of an algorithm is to learn a function that correctly labels new bags or a function that correctly labels new instances. We propose that bags should be treated as latent distributions from which samples are observed. We show that it is possible to learn accurate instance - and bag-labeling functions in this setting as well as functions that correctly rank bags or instances under weak assumptions. Additionally, our theoretical results suggest that it is possible to learn to rank efficiently using traditional, well-studied learning approaches. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation that supports the theoretical predictions entailed by the new framework. The proposed theoretical framework leads to a better understanding of the relationship between the MI and standard supervised learning settings, and it provides new methods for learning from MI data that are more accurate, more efficient, and have better understood theoretical properties than existing MI-specific algorithms.},

However, building useful risk stratification models presents many technical challenges including the large number of factors (both intrinsic and extrinsic) influencing a patient's risk of an adverse outcome and the inherent evolution of that risk over time. We address these challenges in the context of learning a risk stratification model for predicting which patients are at risk of acquiring a Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We take a novel data-centric approach, leveraging the contents of EHRs from nearly 50,000 hospital admissions. We show how, by adapting techniques from multitask learning, we can learn models for patient risk stratification with unprecedented classification performance. Our model, based on thousands of variables, both time-varying and time-invariant, changes over the course of a patient admission. Applied to a held out set of approximately 25,000 patient admissions, we achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI 0.78-0.84). The model has been integrated into the health record system at a large hospital in the US, and can be used to produce daily risk estimates for each inpatient. While more complex than traditional risk stratification methods, the widespread development and use of such data-driven models could ultimately enable cost-effective, targeted prevention strategies that lead to better patient outcomes.},

Such task structures can be exploited by incorporating hierarchical policies that consist of gating networks and sub-policies. However, this concept has only been partially explored for real world settings and complete methods, derived from first principles, are needed. Real world settings are challenging due to large and continuous state-action spaces that are prohibitive for exhaustive sampling methods. We define the problem of learning sub-policies in continuous state action spaces as finding a hierarchical policy that is composed of a high-level gating policy to select the low-level sub-policies for execution by the agent. In order to efficiently share experience with all sub-policies, also called inter-policy learning, we treat these sub-policies as latent variables which allows for distribution of the update information between the sub-policies. We present three different variants of our algorithm, designed to be suitable for a wide variety of real world robot learning tasks and evaluate our algorithms in two real robot learning scenarios as well as several simulations and comparisons.},

The fast model is nearly as efficient as the Nystr\"om method and as accurate as the prototype model. We show that the fast model can potentially solve eigenvalue problems and kernel learning problems in linear time with respect to the matrix size $n$ to achieve $1+\epsilon$ relative-error, whereas both the prototype model and the Nystr\"om method cost at least quadratic time to attain comparable error bound. Empirical comparisons among the prototype model, the Nystr\"om method, and our fast model demonstrate the superiority of the fast model. We also contribute new understandings of the Nystr\"om method. The Nystr\"om method is a special instance of our fast model and is approximation to the prototype model.

Subsequently, we train a domain-adapted classifier by minimizing the expected loss under the resulting transfer model. For linear classifiers and a large family of loss functions and transfer models, this expected loss can be computed or approximated analytically, and minimized efficiently. Our empirical evaluation of FLDA focuses on problems comprising binary and count data in which the transfer can be naturally modeled via a dropout distribution, which allows the classifier to adapt to differences in the marginal probability of features in the source and the target domain. Our experiments on several real-world problems show that FLDA performs on par with state-of-the-art domain-adaptation techniques.},

Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained used 1.2M+ labeled images have emerged as clear winners on object classification benchmarks. Unfortunately, only a small fraction of those labels are available with bounding box localization for training the detection task and even fewer pixel level annotations are available for semantic segmentation. It is much cheaper and easier to collect large quantities of image-level labels from search engines than it is to collect scene-centric images with precisely localized labels. We develop methods for learning large scale recognition models which exploit joint training over both weak (image-level) and strong (bounding box) labels and which transfer learned perceptual representations from strongly-labeled auxiliary tasks. We provide a novel formulation of a joint multiple instance learning method that includes examples from object-centric data with image-level labels when available, and also performs domain transfer learning to improve the underlying detector representation.

We prove that this framework is mathematically equivalent to the widely used multitask feature learning methods that are based on a joint regularization of all model parameters, but with a more general form of regularizers. Further, an analytical formula is derived for the across-task component as related to the task-specific component for all these regularizers, leading to a better understanding of the shrinkage effects of different regularizers. Study of this framework motivates new multitask learning algorithms. We propose two new learning formulations by varying the parameters in the proposed framework.

In particular, guaranteed monotonicity of the learned function with respect to some of the inputs can be critical for user confidence. We propose meeting these goals for low-dimensional machine learning problems by learning flexible, monotonic functions using calibrated interpolated look-up tables. We extend the structural risk minimization framework of lattice regression to monotonic functions by adding linear inequality constraints. In addition, we propose jointly learning interpretable calibrations of each feature to normalize continuous features and handle categorical or missing data, at the cost of making the objective non-convex. We address large-scale learning through parallelization, mini-batching, and random sampling of additive regularizer terms. Case studies on real-world problems with up to sixteen features and up to hundreds of millions of training samples demonstrate the proposed monotonic functions can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in practice while providing greater transparency to users.},

Each of these local objectives is further assumed to be an average of a finite set of functions. The motivation for this setup is to solve large scale machine learning problems where elements of the training set are distributed to multiple computational elements. The decentralized double stochastic averaging gradient (DSA) algorithm is proposed as a solution alternative that relies on: (i) The use of local stochastic averaging gradients. (ii) Determination of descent steps as differences of consecutive stochastic averaging gradients. Strong convexity of local functions and Lipschitz continuity of local gradients is shown to guarantee linear convergence of the sequence generated by DSA in expectation. Local iterates are further shown to approach the optimal argument for almost all realizations. The expected linear convergence of DSA is in contrast to the sublinear rate characteristic of existing methods for decentralized stochastic optimization. Numerical experiments on a logistic regression problem illustrate reductions in convergence time and number of feature vectors processed until convergence relative to these other alternatives.},

 abstract = {Given a high-dimensional data set we often wish to find the strongest relationships within it. A common strategy is to evaluate a measure of dependence on every variable pair and retain the highest-scoring pairs for follow-up. This strategy works well if the statistic used is equitable [Reshef et al. 2015a], i.e., if, for some measure of noise, it assigns similar scores to equally noisy relationships regardless of relationship type (e.g., linear, exponential, periodic). In this paper, we introduce and characterize a population measure of dependence called MIC*. We show three ways that MIC* can be viewed: as the population value of MIC, a highly equitable statistic from [Reshef et al. 2011], as a canonical "smoothing" of mutual information, and as the supremum of an infinite sequence defined in terms of optimal one-dimensional partitions of the marginals of the joint distribution. Based on this theory, we introduce an efficient approach for computing MIC* from the density of a pair of random variables, and we define a new consistent estimator MICe for MIC* that is efficiently computable. In contrast, there is no known polynomial-time algorithm for computing the original equitable statistic MIC. We show through simulations that MICe has better bias-variance properties than MIC. We then introduce and prove the consistency of a second statistic, TICe, that is a trivial side-product of the computation of MICe and whose goal is powerful independence testing rather than equitability. We show in simulations that MICe and TICe have good equitability and power against independence respectively. The analyses here complement a more in-depth empirical evaluation of several leading measures of dependence [Reshef et al. 2015b] that shows state-of-the-art performance for MICe and TICe.},

 abstract = {Slow feature analysis (SFA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm that extracts slowly varying features from a time series. Graph-based SFA (GSFA) is a supervised extension that can solve regression problems if followed by a post-processing regression algorithm. A training graph specifies arbitrary connections between the training samples. The connections in current graphs, however, only depend on the rank of the involved labels. Exploiting the exact label values makes further improvements in estimation accuracy possible. In this article, we propose the exact label learning (ELL) method to create a graph that codes the desired label explicitly, so that GSFA is able to extract a normalized version of it directly. The ELL method is used for three tasks: (1) We estimate gender from artificial images of human faces (regression) and show the advantage of coding additional labels, particularly skin color. (2) We analyze two existing graphs for regression. (3) We extract compact discriminative features to classify traffic sign images. When the number of output features is limited, a higher classification rate is obtained compared to a graph equivalent to nonlinear Fisher discriminant analysis. The method is versatile, directly supports multiple labels, and provides higher accuracy compared to current graphs for the problems considered.},

 abstract = {While machine learning has proven to be a powerful data-driven solution to many real-life problems, its use in sensitive domains has been limited due to privacy concerns. A popular approach known as **differential privacy** offers provable privacy guarantees, but it is often observed in practice that it could substantially hamper learning accuracy. In this paper we study the learnability (whether a problem can be learned by any algorithm) under Vapnik's general learning setting with differential privacy constraint, and reveal some intricate relationships between privacy, stability and learnability. In particular, we show that a problem is privately learnable **if an only if** there is a private algorithm that asymptotically minimizes the empirical risk (AERM). In contrast, for non-private learning AERM alone is not sufficient for learnability. This result suggests that when searching for private learning algorithms, we can restrict the search to algorithms that are AERM. In light of this, we propose a conceptual procedure that always finds a universally consistent algorithm whenever the problem is learnable under privacy constraint. We also propose a generic and practical algorithm and show that under very general conditions it privately learns a wide class of learning problems. Lastly, we extend some of the results to the more practical $(ε,δ)$-differential privacy and establish the existence of a phase-transition on the class of problems that are approximately privately learnable with respect to how small $δ$ needs to be.},

 abstract = {Max-convolution is an important problem closely resembling standard convolution; as such, max-convolution occurs frequently across many fields. Here we extend the method with fastest known worst-case runtime, which can be applied to nonnegative vectors by numerically approximating the Chebyshev norm || ċ ||∞, and use this approach to derive two numerically stable methods based on the idea of computing p-norms via fast convolution: The first method proposed, with runtime in O(k log(k) log(log(k))) (which is less than 18k log(k) for any vectors that can be practically realized), uses the p-norm as a direct approximation of the Chebyshev norm. The second approach proposed, with runtime in O(k log(k)) (although in practice both perform similarly), uses a novel null space projection method, which extracts information from a sequence of p-norms to estimate the maximum value in the vector (this is equivalent to querying a small number of moments from a distribution of bounded support in order to estimate the maximum). The p-norm approaches are compared to one another and are shown to compute an approximation of the Viterbi path in a hidden Markov model where the transition matrix is a Toeplitz matrix; the runtime of approximating the Viterbi path is thus reduced from O(nk2) steps to O(nk log(k)) steps in practice, and is demonstrated by inferring the U.S. unemployment rate from the S&P 500 stock index.},

 abstract = {We investigate the online version of Principle Component Analysis (PCA), where in each trial t the learning algorithm chooses a k-dimensional subspace, and upon receiving the next instance vector xt, suffers the loss, which is the squared Euclidean distance between this instance and its projection into the chosen subspace. When viewed in the right parameterization, this compression loss is linear, i.e. it can be rewritten as tr(Wtxtxt⊤), where Wt is the parameter of the algorithm and the outer product xtxt⊤ (with ||xt|| ≤ 1) is the instance matrix. In this paper generalize PCA to arbitrary positive definite instance matrices Xt with the linear loss tr(WtXt).

We evaluate online algorithms in terms of their worst-case regret, which is a bound on the additional total loss of the online algorithm on all instances matrices over the compression loss of the best k-dimensional subspace (chosen in hindsight). We focus on two popular online algorithms for generalized PCA: the Gradient Descent (GD) and Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) algorithms. We show that if the regret is expressed as a function of the number of trials, then both algorithms are optimal to within a constant factor on worst-case sequences of positive definite instances matrices with trace norm at most one (which subsumes the original PCA problem with outer products). This is surprising because MEG is believed be suboptimal in this case. We also show that when considering regret bounds as a function of a loss budget, then MEG remains optimal and strictly outperforms GD when the instance matrices are trace norm bounded.

Next, we consider online PCA when the adversary is allowed to present the algorithm with positive semidefinite instance matrices whose largest eigenvalue is bounded (rather than their trace which is the sum of their eigenvalues). Again we can show that MEG is optimal and strictly better than GD in this setting.},

 abstract = {This paper develops an efficient computational method for solving a Gaussian process (GP) regression for large spatial data sets using a collection of suitably defined local GP regressions. The conventional local GP approach first partitions a domain into multiple non-overlapping local regions, and then fits an independent GP regression for each local region using the training data belonging to the region. Two key issues with the local GP are (1) the prediction around the boundary of a local region is not as accurate as the prediction at interior of the local region, and (2) two local GP regressions for two neighboring local regions produce different predictions at the boundary of the two regions, creating undesirable discontinuity in the prediction. We address these issues by constraining the predictions of local GP regressions sharing a common boundary to satisfy the same boundary constraints, which in turn are estimated by the data. The boundary constrained local GP regressions are solved by a finite element method. Our approach shows competitive performance when compared with several state-of-the-art methods using two synthetic data sets and three real data sets.},

For convex target sets, these vectors are obtained as projections from the current average payoff vector to the set. A recent paper by Abernethy, Batlett and Hazan (2011) proposed a class of approachability algorithms that rely on Online Linear Programming for obtaining alternative sequences of direction vectors. This is first implemented for target sets that are convex cones, and then generalized to any convex set by embedding it in a higher-dimensional convex cone. In this paper we present a more direct formulation that relies on general Online Convex Optimization (OCO) algorithms, along with basic properties of the support function of convex sets. This leads to a general class of approachability algorithms, depending on the choice of the OCO algorithm and the used norms. Blackwell's original algorithm and its convergence are recovered when Follow The Leader (or a regularized version thereof) is used for the OCO algorithm.},

Our methodology is based on projections of the emission distributions onto nested subspaces of increasing complexity. The popular spectral estimators are unable to achieve the optimal rate but may be used as initial points in our procedure.

 abstract = {In this paper we introduce a novel framework for making exact nonparametric Bayesian inference on latent functions that is particularly suitable for Big Data tasks. Firstly, we introduce a class of stochastic processes we refer to as string Gaussian processes (string GPs which are not to be mistaken for Gaussian processes operating on text). We construct string GPs so that their finite-dimensional marginals exhibit suitable local conditional independence structures, which allow for scalable, distributed, and flexible nonparametric Bayesian inference, without resorting to approximations, and while ensuring some mild global regularity constraints. Furthermore, string GP priors naturally cope with heterogeneous input data, and the gradient of the learned latent function is readily available for explanatory analysis. Secondly, we provide some theoretical results relating our approach to the standard GP paradigm. In particular, we prove that some string GPs are Gaussian processes, which provides a complementary global perspective on our framework. Finally, we derive a scalable and distributed MCMC scheme for supervised learning tasks under string GP priors. The proposed MCMC scheme has computational time complexity O(N) and memory requirement O(dN), where N is the data size and d the dimension of the input space. We illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on several synthetic and real-world data sets, including a data set with 6 millions input points and 8 attributes.},

Many variable selection methods have been developed under various model assumptions. Whereas success has been widely reported in literature, their performances largely depend on validity of the assumed models, such as the linear or additive models. This article introduces a model-free variable selection method via learning the gradient functions. The idea is based on the equivalence between whether a variable is informative and whether its corresponding gradient function is substantially non-zero. The proposed variable selection method is then formulated in a framework of learning gradients in a flexible reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The key advantage of the proposed method is that it requires no explicit model assumption and allows for general variable effects. Its asymptotic estimation and selection consistencies are studied, which establish the convergence rate of the estimated sparse gradients and assure that the truly informative variables are correctly identified in probability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also supported by a variety of simulated examples and two real-life examples.},

 abstract = {Systematic reviews underpin Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) by addressing precise clinical questions via comprehensive synthesis of all relevant published evidence. Authors of systematic reviews typically define a Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (a PICO criteria) of interest, and then retrieve, appraise and synthesize results from all reports of clinical trials that meet these criteria. Identifying PICO elements in the full-texts of trial reports is thus a critical yet time-consuming step in the systematic review process. We seek to expedite evidence synthesis by developing machine learning models to automatically extract sentences from articles relevant to PICO elements. Collecting a large corpus of training data for this task would be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, we derive distant supervision (DS) with which to train models using previously conducted reviews. DS entails heuristically deriving 'soft' labels from an available structured resource. However, we have access only to unstructured, free-text summaries of PICO elements for corresponding articles; we must derive from these the desired sentence-level annotations. To this end, we propose a novel method - supervised distant supervision (SDS) - that uses a small amount of direct supervision to better exploit a large corpus of distantly labeled instances by learning to pseudo-annotate articles using the available DS. We show that this approach tends to outperform existing methods with respect to automated PICO extraction.},

In this work we investigate approximate Newton methods for policy optimization in Markov decision processes (MDPs). We first analyse the structure of the Hessian of the total expected reward, which is a standard objective function for MDPs. We show that, like the gradient, the Hessian exhibits useful structure in the context of MDPs and we use this analysis to motivate two Gauss-Newton methods for MDPs. Like the Gauss-Newton method for non-linear least squares, these methods drop certain terms in the Hessian. The approximate Hessians possess desirable properties, such as negative definiteness, and we demonstrate several important performance guarantees including guaranteed ascent directions, invariance to afine transformation of the parameter space and convergence guarantees. We finally provide a unifying perspective of key policy search algorithms, demonstrating that our second Gauss-Newton algorithm is closely related to both the EM-algorithm and natural gradient ascent applied to MDPs, but performs significantly better in practice on a range of challenging domains.},

 abstract = {This paper presents an information theory-driven matching methodology for making causal inference from observational data. The paper adopts a potential outcomes framework view on evaluating the strength of cause-effect relationships: the population-wide average effects of binary treatments are estimated by comparing two groups of units - the treated and untreated (control). To reduce the bias in such treatment effect estimation, one has to compose a control group in such a way that across the compared groups of units, treatment is independent of the units' covariates. This requirement gives rise to a subset selection / matching problem. This paper presents the models and algorithms that solve the matching problem by minimizing the mutual information (MI) between the covariates and the treatment variable. Such a formulation becomes tractable thanks to the derived optimality conditions that tackle the non-linearity of the sample-based MI function. Computational experiments with mixed integer-programming formulations and four matching algorithms demonstrate the utility of MI based matching for causal inference studies. The algorithmic developments culminate in a matching heuristic that allows for balancing the compared groups in polynomial (close to linear) time, thus allowing for treatment effect estimation with large data sets.},

 abstract = {Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is the most common cause of pediatric epilepsy and the third most common cause in adults with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Surgical resection of the lesion is the most effective treatment to stop seizures. Technical advances in MRI have revolutionized the diagnosis of FCD, leading to high success rates for resective surgery. However, 45% of histologically confirmed FCD patients have normal MRIs (MRI-negative). Without a visible lesion, the success rate of surgery drops from 66% to 29%. In this work, we cast the problem of detecting potential FCD lesions using MRI scans of MRI-negative patients in an image segmentation framework based on hierarchical conditional random fields (HCRF). We use surface based morphometry to model the cortical surface as a two-dimensional surface which is then segmented at multiple scales to extract superpixels of different sizes. Each superpixel is assigned an outlier score by comparing it to a control population. The lesion is detected by fusing the outlier probabilities across multiple scales using a tree-structured HCRF. The proposed method achieves a higher detection rate, with superior recall and precision on a sample of twenty MRI-negative FCD patients as compared to a baseline across four morphological features and their combinations.},

 abstract = {Electronic Health Record (EHR) phenotyping utilizes patient data captured through normal medical practice, to identify features that may represent computational medical phenotypes. These features may be used to identify at-risk patients and improve prediction of patient morbidity and mortality. We present a novel deep multi-modality architecture for EHR analysis (applicable to joint analysis of multiple forms of EHR data), based on Poisson Factor Analysis (PFA) modules. Each modality, composed of observed counts, is represented as a Poisson distribution, parameterized in terms of hidden binary units. Information from different modalities is shared via a deep hierarchy of common hidden units. Activation of these binary units occurs with probability characterized as Bernoulli-Poisson link functions, instead of more traditional logistic link functions. In addition, we demonstrate that PFA modules can be adapted to discriminative modalities. To compute model parameters, we derive efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference that scales efficiently, with significant computational gains when compared to related models based on logistic link functions. To explore the utility of these models, we apply them to a subset of patients from the Duke-Durham patient cohort. We identified a cohort of over 16,000 patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) based on diagnosis codes and laboratory tests out of our patient population of over 240,000. Examining the common hidden units uniting the PFA modules, we identify patient features that represent medical concepts. Experiments indicate that our learned features are better able to predict mortality and morbidity than clinical features identified previously in a large-scale clinical trial.},

However, deriving these trajectories from observational sources is challenging: electronic health records only reflect observations of patients at irregular intervals and only record what factors are clinically relevant at the time of observation. Meanwhile, caretakers discuss daily developments and concerns on social media.

In this work, we present a fully unsupervised approach for learning disease trajectories from incomplete medical records and social media posts, including cases in which we have only a single observation of each patient. In particular, we use a dynamic topic model approach which embeds each disease trajectory as a path in RD. A Polya-gamma augmentation scheme is used to efficiently perform inference as well as incorporate multiple data sources. We learn disease trajectories from the electronic health records of 13,435 patients with ASD and the forum posts of 13,743 caretakers of children with ASD, deriving interesting clinical insights as well as good predictions.},

 abstract = {Complex chronic diseases (e.g., autism, lupus, and Parkinson's) are remarkably heterogeneous across individuals. This heterogeneity makes treatment difficult for caregivers because they cannot accurately predict the way in which the disease will progress in order to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, tools that help to predict the trajectory of these complex chronic diseases can help to improve the quality of health care. To build such tools, we can leverage clinical markers that are collected at baseline when a patient first presents and longitudinally over time during follow-up visits. Because complex chronic diseases are typically systemic, the longitudinal markers often track disease progression in multiple organ systems. In this paper, our goal is to predict a function of time that models the future trajectory of a single target clinical marker tracking a disease process of interest. We want to make these predictions using the histories of many related clinical markers as input. Our proposed solution tackles several key challenges. First, we can easily handle irregularly and sparsely sampled markers, which are standard in clinical data. Second, the number of parameters and the computational complexity of learning our model grows linearly in the number of marker types included in the model. This makes our approach applicable to diseases where many different markers are recorded over time. Finally, our model accounts for latent factors influencing disease expression, whereas standard regression models rely on observed features alone to explain variability. Moreover, our approach can be applied dynamically in continous-time and updates its predictions as soon as any new data is available. We apply our approach to the problem of predicting lung disease trajectories in scleroderma, a complex autoimmune disease. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and we provide a qualitative analysis of our model's output. Finally, the variability of disease presentation in scleroderma makes clinical trial recruitment challenging. We show that a prognostic tool that integrates multiple types of routinely collected longitudinal data can be used to identify individuals at greatest risk of rapid progression and to target trial recruitment.},

 abstract = {We consider statistical as well as algorithmic aspects of solving large-scale least-squares (LS) problems using randomized sketching algorithms. For a LS problem with input data $(X, Y) \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p} \times \mathbb{R}^n$, sketching algorithms use a sketching matrix, $S\in\mathbb{R}^{r \times n}$ with $r \ll n$. Then, rather than solving the LS problem using the full data $(X,Y)$, sketching algorithms solve the LS problem using only the sketched data $(SX, SY)$. Prior work has typically adopted an algorithmic perspective, in that it has made no statistical assumptions on the input $X$ and $Y$, and instead it has been assumed that the data $(X,Y)$ are fixed and worst-case (WC). Prior results show that, when using sketching matrices such as random projections and leverage-score sampling algorithms, with $p &lt; r \ll n$, the WC error is the same as solving the original problem, up to a small constant. From a statistical perspective, we typically consider the mean-squared error performance of randomized sketching algorithms, when data $(X, Y)$ are generated according to a statistical model $Y = X β+ ε$, where $ε$ is a noise process. We provide a rigorous comparison of both perspectives leading to insights on how they differ. To do this, we first develop a framework for assessing algorithmic and statistical aspects of randomized sketching methods. We then consider the statistical prediction efficiency (PE) and the statistical residual efficiency (RE) of the sketched LS estimator; and we use our framework to provide upper bounds for several types of random projection and random sampling sketching algorithms. Among other results, we show that the RE can be upper bounded when $p &lt; r \ll n$ while the PE typically requires the sample size $r$ to be substantially larger. Lower bounds developed in subsequent results show that our upper bounds on PE can not be improved.},

The RBM and Deep Belief Network have been shown to be universal approximators for probability distributions on binary vectors. In this paper we prove several similar universal approximation results for two variations of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine with time dependence, the Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) and the Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RTRBM). We show that the TRBM is a universal approximator for Markov chains and generalize the theorem to sequences with longer time dependence. We then prove that the RTRBM is a universal approximator for stochastic processes with _nite time dependence. We conclude with a discussion on efficiency and how the constructions developed could explain some previous experimental results.},

 abstract = {Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally infeasible. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the Metropolis-Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing step sizes. In Teh et al. (2014), we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.},

 abstract = {Structured prediction models have been found to learn effectively from a few large examples-- sometimes even just one. Despite empirical evidence, canonical learning theory cannot guarantee generalization in this setting because the error bounds decrease as a function of the number of examples. We therefore propose new PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds for structured prediction that decrease as a function of both the number of examples and the size of each example. Our analysis hinges on the stability of joint inference and the smoothness of the data distribution. We apply our bounds to several common learning scenarios, including max-margin and soft-max training of Markov random fields. Under certain conditions, the resulting error bounds can be far more optimistic than previous results and can even guarantee generalization from a single large example.},

Indeed, by considering the additional sparsity assumption (at each stage, at most $s$ decisions incur a nonzero outcome), we derive optimal regret bounds of different orders. Specifically, with gains, we obtain an optimal regret guarantee after $T$ stages of order $\sqrt{T\log s}$, so the classical dependency in the dimension is replaced by the sparsity size. With losses, we provide matching upper and lower bounds of order $\sqrt{Ts\log(d)/d}$, which is decreasing in $d$. Eventually, we also study the bandit setting, and obtain an upper bound of order $\sqrt{Ts\log (d/s)}$ when outcomes are losses. This bound is proven to be optimal up to the logarithmic factor $\sqrt{\log(d/s)}$.},

To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method.

 abstract = {Cluster analysis by nonnegative low-rank approximations has experienced a remarkable progress in the past decade. However, the majority of such approximation approaches are still restricted to nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) and suffer from the following two drawbacks: 1) they are unable to produce balanced partitions for large-scale manifold data which are common in real-world clustering tasks; 2) most existing NMF-type clustering methods cannot automatically determine the number of clusters. We propose a new low-rank learning method to address these two problems, which is beyond matrix factorization. Our method approximately decomposes a sparse input similarity in a normalized way and its objective can be used to learn both cluster assignments and the number of clusters. For efficient optimization, we use a relaxed formulation based on Data-Cluster-Data random walk, which is also shown to be equivalent to low-rank factorization of the doubly-stochastically normalized cluster incidence matrix. The probabilistic cluster assignments can thus be learned with a multiplicative majorization-minimization algorithm. Experimental results show that the new method is more accurate both in terms of clustering large-scale manifold data sets and of selecting the number of clusters.},

Theoretically, we establish a finite-sample mis-clustering error bound for penalized regression based clustering with the L0 constrained regularization in a general setting.

In this paper, we focus on the class of planar Ising models, for which exact inference is tractable using techniques of statistical physics. Based on these techniques and recent methods for planarity testing and planar embedding, we propose a simple greedy algorithm for learning the best planar Ising model to approximate an arbitrary collection of binary random variables (possibly from sample data). Given the set of all pairwise correlations among variables, we select a planar graph and optimal planar Ising model defined on this graph to best approximate that set of correlations.

In particular, if either of the terms are nonconvex, existing alternating minimization techniques may fail to converge; other types of existing approaches may instead be unable to handle nondifferentiability. We propose the MOCCA (mirrored convex/concave) algorithm, a primal/dual optimization approach that takes a local convex approximation to each term at every iteration. Inspired by optimization problems arising in computed tomography (CT) imaging, this algorithm can handle a range of nonconvex composite optimization problems, and offers theoretical guarantees for convergence when the overall problem is approximately convex (that is, any concavity in one term is balanced out by convexity in the other term). Empirical results show fast convergence for several structured signal recovery problems.},

 abstract = {As data sets of related studies become more easily accessible, combining data sets of similar studies is often undertaken in practice to achieve a larger sample size and higher power. A major challenge arising from data integration pertains to data heterogeneity in terms of study population, study design, or study coordination. Ignoring such heterogeneity in data analysis may result in biased estimation and misleading inference. Traditional techniques of remedy to data heterogeneity include the use of interactions and random effects, which are inferior to achieving desirable statistical power or providing a meaningful interpretation, especially when a large number of smaller data sets are combined. In this paper, we propose a regularized fusion method that allows us to identify and merge inter-study homogeneous parameter clusters in regression analysis, without the use of hypothesis testing approach. Using the fused lasso, we establish a computationally efficient procedure to deal with large-scale integrated data. Incorporating the estimated parameter ordering in the fused lasso facilitates computing speed with no loss of statistical power. We conduct extensive simulation studies and provide an application example to demonstrate the performance of the new method with a comparison to the conventional methods.},

 abstract = {The temporal-difference methods TD($\lambda$) and Sarsa($\lambda$) form a core part of modern reinforcement learning. Their appeal comes from their good performance, low computational cost, and their simple interpretation, given by their forward view. Recently, new versions of these methods were introduced, called true online TD($\lambda$) and true online Sarsa($\lambda$), respectively (van Seijen & Sutton, 2014). These new versions maintain an exact equivalence with the forward view at all times, whereas the traditional versions only approximate it for small step-sizes. We hypothesize that these true online methods not only have better theoretical properties, but also dominate the regular methods empirically. In this article, we put this hypothesis to the test by performing an extensive empirical comparison. Specifically, we compare the performance of true online TD($\lambda$)/Sarsa($\lambda$) with regular TD($\lambda$)/Sarsa($\lambda$) on random MRPs, a real-world myoelectric prosthetic arm, and a domain from the Arcade Learning Environment. We use linear function approximation with tabular, binary, and non-binary features. Our results suggest that the true online methods indeed dominate the regular methods. Across all domains/representations the learning speed of the true online methods are often better, but never worse than that of the regular methods. An additional advantage is that no choice between traces has to be made for the true online methods. Besides the empirical results, we provide an in-depth analysis of the theory behind true online temporal-difference learning. In addition, we show that new true online temporal-difference methods can be derived by making changes to the online forward view and then rewriting the update equations.},

Of particular interest to us is to efficiently solve problems with decoupled constraints, in which subsets of the objective and constraint functions may be evaluated independently. For example, when the objective is evaluated on a CPU and the constraints are evaluated independently on a GPU. These problems require an acquisition function that can be separated into the contributions of the individual function evaluations. We develop one such acquisition function and call it Predictive Entropy Search with Constraints (PESC). PESC is an approximation to the expected information gain criterion and it compares favorably to alternative approaches based on improvement in several synthetic and real-world problems. In addition to this, we consider problems with a mix of functions that are fast and slow to evaluate. These problems require balancing the amount of time spent in the meta-computation of PESC and in the actual evaluation of the target objective. We take a bounded rationality approach and develop a partial update for PESC which trades o_ accuracy against speed. We then propose a method for adaptively switching between the partial and full updates for PESC. This allows us to interpolate between versions of PESC that are efficient in terms of function evaluations and those that are efficient in terms of wall-clock time. Overall, we demonstrate that PESC is an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.},

 abstract = {Adjusted for chance measures are widely used to compare partitions/clusterings of the same data set. In particular, the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) based on pair-counting, and the Adjusted Mutual Information (AMI) based on Shannon information theory are very popular in the clustering community. Nonetheless it is an open problem as to what are the best application scenarios for each measure and guidelines in the literature for their usage are sparse, with the result that users often resort to using both. Generalized Information Theoretic (IT) measures based on the Tsallis entropy have been shown to link pair-counting and Shannon IT measures. In this paper, we aim to bridge the gap between adjustment of measures based on pair-counting and measures based on information theory. We solve the key technical challenge of analytically computing the expected value and variance of generalized IT measures. This allows us to propose adjustments of generalized IT measures, which reduce to well known adjusted clustering comparison measures as special cases. Using the theory of generalized IT measures, we are able to propose the following guidelines for using ARI and AMI as external validation indices: ARI should be used when the reference clustering has large equal sized clusters; AMI should be used when the reference clustering is unbalanced and there exist small clusters.},

The GBN's hidden layers are jointly trained with an upward-downward Gibbs sampler that solves each layer with the same subroutine. The gamma-negative binomial process combined with a layer-wise training strategy allows inferring the width of each layer given a fixed budget on the width of the first layer. Example results illustrate interesting relationships between the width of the first layer and the inferred network structure, and demonstrate that the GBN can add more layers to improve its performance in both unsupervisedly extracting features and predicting heldout data. For exploratory data analysis, we extract trees and subnetworks from the learned deep network to visualize how the very specific factors discovered at the first hidden layer and the increasingly more general factors discovered at deeper hidden layers are related to each other, and we generate synthetic data by propagating random variables through the deep network from the top hidden layer back to the bottom data layer.},

Crowdsourcing is cheap and fast, but suffers from the problem of low-quality data. To address this fundamental challenge in crowdsourcing, we propose a simple payment mechanism to incentivize workers to answer only the questions that they are sure of and skip the rest. We show that surprisingly, under a mild and natural "no-free-lunch" requirement, this mechanism is the one and only incentive-compatible payment mechanism possible. We also show that among all possible incentive-compatible mechanisms (that may or may not satisfy no-free-lunch), our mechanism makes the smallest possible payment to spammers. We further extend our results to a more general setting in which workers are required to provide a quantized confidence for each question. Interestingly, this unique mechanism takes a "multiplicative" form. The simplicity of the mechanism is an added benefit. In preliminary experiments involving over 900 worker-task pairs, we observe a significant drop in the error rates under this unique mechanism for the same or lower monetary expenditure.},

 abstract = {Gaussian graphical models capture dependence relationships between random variables through the pattern of nonzero elements in the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. To date, there has been a large body of literature on both computational methods and analytical results on the estimation of a single graphical model. However, in many application domains, one has to estimate several related graphical models, a problem that has also received attention in the literature. The available approaches usually assume that all graphical models are globally related. On the other hand, in many settings different relationships between subsets of the node sets exist between different graphical models. We develop methodology that jointly estimates multiple Gaussian graphical models, assuming that there exists prior information on how they are structurally related. For many applications, such information is available from external data sources. The proposed method consists of first applying neighborhood selection with a group lasso penalty to obtain edge sets of the graphs, and a maximum likelihood refit for estimating the nonzero entries in the inverse covariance matrices. We establish consistency of the proposed method for sparse high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models and examine its performance using simulation experiments. Applications to a climate data set and a breast cancer data set are also discussed.},

In the present paper we analyze algorithms based on covariance screening and least squares with L1 penalization (i.e. LASSO) and demonstrate that they can also enjoy optimal (up to a scalar) rescaled sample size in terms of support recovery, albeit under slightly different assumptions on f and ε compared to the SIR based algorithms. Furthermore, we show more generally, that LASSO succeeds in recovering the signed support of β0 if X ~ 풩 (0, Σ), and the covariance Σ satisfies the irrepresentable condition.

 abstract = {Learning risk scores to predict dichotomous or continuous outcomes using machine learning approaches has been studied extensively. However, how to learn risk scores for time-to-event outcomes subject to right censoring has received little attention until recently. Existing approaches rely on inverse probability weighting or rank-based regression, which may be inefficient. In this paper, we develop a new support vector hazards machine (SVHM) approach to predict censored outcomes. Our method is based on predicting the counting process associated with the time-to-event outcomes among subjects at risk via a series of support vector machines. Introducing counting processes to represent time-to-event data leads to a connection between support vector machines in supervised learning and hazards regression in standard survival analysis. To account for different at risk populations at observed event times, a time-varying offset is used in estimating risk scores. The resulting optimization is a convex quadratic programming problem that can easily incorporate non-linearity using kernel trick. We demonstrate an interesting link from the profiled empirical risk function of SVHM to the Cox partial likelihood. We then formally show that SVHM is optimal in discriminating covariate-specific hazard function from population average hazard function, and establish the consistency and learning rate of the predicted risk using the estimated risk scores. Simulation studies show improved prediction accuracy of the event times using SVHM compared to existing machine learning methods and standard conventional approaches. Finally, we analyze two real world biomedical study data where we use clinical markers and neuroimaging biomarkers to predict age-at-onset of a disease, and demonstrate superiority of SVHM in distinguishing high risk versus low risk subjects.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the problem of finding a sparse graph capturing the conditional dependence between the entries of a Gaussian random vector, where the only available information is a sample correlation matrix. A popular approach to address this problem is the graphical lasso technique, which employs a sparsity-promoting regularization term. This paper derives a simple condition under which the computationally-expensive graphical lasso behaves the same as the simple heuristic method of thresholding. This condition depends only on the solution of graphical lasso and makes no direct use of the sample correlation matrix or the regularization coefficient. It is proved that this condition is always satisfied if the solution of graphical lasso is close to its first-order Taylor approximation or equivalently the regularization term is relatively large. This condition is tested on several random problems, and it is shown that graphical lasso and the thresholding method lead to highly similar results in the case where a sparse graph is sought. We also conduct two case studies on brain connectivity networks of twenty subjects based on fMRI data and the topology identification of electrical circuits to support the findings of this work on the similarity of graphical lasso and thresholding.},

 abstract = {Many data sets can be represented as a sequence of interactions between entities--for example communications between individuals in a social network, protein-protein interactions or DNA-protein interactions in a biological context, or vehicles' journeys between cities. In these contexts, there is often interest in making predictions about future interactions, such as who will message whom.

A popular approach to network modeling in a Bayesian context is to assume that the observed interactions can be explained in terms of some latent structure. For example, tra_c patterns might be explained by the size and importance of cities, and social network interactions might be explained by the social groups and interests of individuals. Unfortunately, while elucidating this structure can be useful, it often does not directly translate into an effective predictive tool. Further, many existing approaches are not appropriate for sparse networks, a class that includes many interesting real-world situations.

In this paper, we develop models for sparse networks that combine structure elucidation with predictive performance. We use a Bayesian nonparametric approach, which allows us to predict interactions with entities outside our training set, and allows the both the latent dimensionality of the model and the number of nodes in the network to grow in expectation as we see more data. We demonstrate that we can capture latent structure while maintaining predictive power, and discuss possible extensions.},

We first show that this spectral seriation algorithm recovers the true ranking when all pairwise comparisons are observed and consistent with a total order. We then show that ranking reconstruction is still exact even when some pairwise comparisons are corrupted or missing, and that seriation based spectral ranking is more robust to noise than other scoring methods. An additional benefit of the seriation formulation is that it allows us to solve semi-supervised ranking problems. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that seriation based spectral ranking achieves competitive and in some cases superior performance compared to classical ranking methods.},

Conductance is a popular objective function used in many algorithms for local community detection. This paper studies a continuous relaxation of conductance. We show that continuous optimization of this objective still leads to discrete communities. We investigate the relation of conductance with weighted kernel k-means for a single community, which leads to the introduction of a new objective function, $σ$-conductance. Conductance is obtained by setting $σ$ to $0$. Two algorithms, EMc and PGDc, are proposed to locally optimize $σ$-conductance and automatically tune the parameter $σ$. They are based on expectation maximization and projected gradient descent, respectively. We prove locality and give performance guarantees for EMc and PGDc for a class of dense and well separated communities centered around the seeds. Experiments are conducted on networks with ground-truth communities, comparing to state-of-the-art graph diffusion algorithms for conductance optimization. On large graphs, results indicate that EMc and PGDc stay localized and produce communities most similar to the ground, while graph diffusion algorithms generate large communities of lower quality.},

 abstract = {Rank aggregation based on pairwise comparisons over a set of items has a wide range of applications. Although considerable research has been devoted to the development of rank aggregation algorithms, one basic question is how to efficiently collect a large amount of high-quality pairwise comparisons for the ranking purpose. Because of the advent of many crowdsourcing services, a crowd of workers are often hired to conduct pairwise comparisons with a small monetary reward for each pair they compare. Since different workers have different levels of reliability and different pairs have different levels of ambiguity, it is desirable to wisely allocate the limited budget for comparisons among the pairs of items and workers so that the global ranking can be accurately inferred from the comparison results. To this end, we model the active sampling problem in crowdsourced ranking as a Bayesian Markov decision process, which dynamically selects item pairs and workers to improve the ranking accuracy under a budget constraint. We further develop a computationally efficient sampling policy based on knowledge gradient as well as a moment matching technique for posterior approximation. Experimental evaluations on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed policy achieves high ranking accuracy with a lower labeling cost.},

Spurious discoveries can easily arise in high-dimensional data analysis due to enormous possibilities of such selections. How can we know statistically our discoveries better than those by chance? In this paper, we define a measure of goodness of spurious fit, which shows how good a response variable can be fitted by an optimally selected subset of covariates under the null model, and propose a simple and effective LAMM algorithm to compute it. It coincides with the maximum spurious correlation for linear models and can be regarded as a generalized maximum spurious correlation. We derive the asymptotic distribution of such goodness of spurious fit for generalized linear models and L1-regression. Such an asymptotic distribution depends on the sample size, ambient dimension, the number of variables used in the fit, and the covariance information. It can be consistently estimated by multiplier bootstrapping and used as a benchmark to guard against spurious discoveries. It can also be applied to model selection, which considers only candidate models with goodness of fits better than those by spurious fits.

In benchmarks, even on a single-core desktop computer, our code embeds millions of data points in minutes, and takes just 200 minutes to embed the main sample of galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-- consisting of 0.6 million samples in 3750-dimensions--a task which has not previously been possible.},

 abstract = {Novelty detection or one-class classification starts from a model describing some type of 'normal behaviour' and aims to classify deviations from this model as being either novelties or anomalies.

In this paper the problem of novelty detection for point patterns S = {x1,...,xk} ⊂ Rd is treated where examples of anomalies are very sparse, or even absent. The latter complicates the tuning of hyperparameters in models commonly used for novelty detection, such as one-class support vector machines and hidden Markov models.

To this end, the use of extreme value statistics is introduced to estimate explicitly a model for the abnormal class by means of extrapolation from a statistical model X for the normal class. We show how multiple types of information obtained from any available extreme instances of S can be combined to reduce the high false-alarm rate that is typically encountered when classes are strongly imbalanced, as often occurs in the one-class setting (whereby 'abnormal' data are often scarce).

The approach is illustrated using simulated data and then a real-life application is used as an exemplar, whereby accelerometry data from epileptic seizures are analysed - these are known to be extreme and rare with respect to normal accelerometer data.},

To cope with possible multi-modal as well as non-elliptic population distributions, we develop a localized version of spatial depth and use that with varying degrees of localization to build the classifier. Final classification is done by aggregating several posterior probability estimates each of which is obtained using localized spatial depth with a fixed scale of localization. The proposed classifier can be conveniently used even when the dimension is larger than the sample size, and its good discriminatory power for such data has been established using theoretical as well as numerical results.},

 abstract = {This article describes a method for constructing a special rule (we call it synergy rule) that uses as its input information the outputs (scores) of several monotonic rules which solve the same pattern recognition problem. As an example of scores of such monotonic rules we consider here scores of SVM classifiers.

In order to construct the optimal synergy rule, we estimate the conditional probability function based on the direct problem setting, which requires solving a Fredholm integral equation. Generally, solving a Fredholm equation is an ill-posed problem. However, in our model, we look for the solution of the equation in the set of monotonic and bounded functions, which makes the problem well-posed. This allows us to solve the equation accurately even with training data sets of limited size.

In order to construct a monotonic solution, we use the set of functions that belong to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) associated with the INK-spline kernel (splines with Infinite Numbers of Knots) of degree zero. The paper provides details of the methods for finding multidimensional conditional probability in a set of monotonic functions to obtain the corresponding synergy rules. We demonstrate effectiveness of such rules for 1) solving standard pattern recognition problems, 2) constructing multi-class classification rules, 3) constructing a method for knowledge transfer from multiple intelligent teachers in the LUPI paradigm.},

 abstract = {The article examines in some detail the convergence rate and mean-square-error performance of momentum stochastic gradient methods in the constant step-size and slow adaptation regime. The results establish that momentum methods are equivalent to the standard stochastic gradient method with a re-scaled (larger) step-size value. The size of the re-scaling is determined by the value of the momentum parameter. The equivalence result is established for all time instants and not only in steady-state. The analysis is carried out for general strongly convex and smooth risk functions, and is not limited to quadratic risks. One notable conclusion is that the well-known bene ts of momentum constructions for deterministic optimization problems do not necessarily carry over to the adaptive online setting when small constant step-sizes are used to enable continuous adaptation and learn- ing in the presence of persistent gradient noise. From simulations, the equivalence between momentum and standard stochastic gradient methods is also observed for non-differentiable and non-convex problems.},

Although methods for vector-valued data are well established, functional data graphical models remain underdeveloped. We introduce a notion of conditional independence between random functions, and construct a framework for Bayesian inference of undirected, decomposable graphs in the multivariate functional data context. This framework is based on extending Markov distributions and hyper Markov laws from random variables to random processes, providing a principled alternative to naive application of multivariate methods to discretized functional data. Markov properties facilitate the composition of likelihoods and priors according to the decomposition of a graph. Our focus is on Gaussian process graphical models using orthogonal basis expansions. We propose a hyper-inverse-Wishart-process prior for the covariance kernels of the infinite coefficient sequences of the basis expansion, establish existence, uniqueness, strong hyper Markov property, and conjugacy.

 abstract = {This paper provides a general technique for lower bounding the Bayes risk of statistical estimation, applicable to arbitrary loss functions and arbitrary prior distributions. A lower bound on the Bayes risk not only serves as a lower bound on the minimax risk, but also characterizes the fundamental limit of any estimator given the prior knowledge. Our bounds are based on the notion of f-informativity (Csiszar, 1972), which is a function of the underlying class of probability measures and the prior. Application of our bounds requires upper bounds on the f-informativity, thus we derive new upper bounds on f-informativity which often lead to tight Bayes risk lower bounds. Our technique leads to generalizations of a variety of classical minimax bounds (e.g., generalized Fano's inequality). Our Bayes risk lower bounds can be directly applied to several concrete estimation problems, including Gaussian location models, generalized linear models, and principal component analysis for spiked covariance models. To further demonstrate the applications of our Bayes risk lower bounds to machine learning problems, we present two new theoretical results: (1) a precise characterization of the minimax risk of learning spherical Gaussian mixture models under the smoothed analysis framework, and (2) lower bounds for the Bayes risk under a natural prior for both the prediction and estimation errors for high-dimensional sparse linear regression under an improper learning setting.},

Rank-breaking is a common practice to reduce the computational complexity of learning the global ranking. The individual preferences are broken into pairwise comparisons and applied to efficient algorithms tailored for independent paired comparisons. However, due to the ignored dependencies in the data, naive rank-breaking approaches can result in inconsistent estimates. The key idea to produce accurate and consistent estimates is to treat the pairwise comparisons unequally, depending on the topology of the collected data. In this paper, we provide the optimal rank-breaking estimator, which not only achieves consistency but also achieves the best error bound. This allows us to characterize the fundamental tradeoff between accuracy and complexity. Further, the analysis identies how the accuracy depends on the spectral gap of a corresponding comparison graph.},

 abstract = {We consider the emphatic temporal-difference (TD) algorithm, ETD(λ), for learning the value functions of stationary policies in a discounted, finite state and action Markov decision process. The ETD(λ) algorithm was recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White (2016) to solve a long-standing divergence problem of the standard TD algorithm when it is applied to off-policy training, where data from an exploratory policy are used to evaluate other policies of interest. The almost sure convergence of ETD(λ) has been proved in our recent work under general off-policy training conditions, but for a narrow range of diminishing stepsize. In this paper we present convergence results for constrained versions of ETD(λ) with constant stepsize and with diminishing stepsize from a broad range. Our results characterize the asymptotic behavior of the trajectory of iterates produced by those algorithms, and are derived by combining key properties of ETD(λ) with powerful convergence theorems from the weak convergence methods in stochastic approximation theory. For the case of constant stepsize, in addition to analyzing the behavior of the algorithms in the limit as the stepsize parameter approaches zero, we also analyze their behavior for a fixed stepsize and bound the deviations of their averaged iterates from the desired solution. These results are obtained by exploiting the weak Feller property of the Markov chains associated with the algorithms, and by using ergodic theorems for weak Feller Markov chains, in conjunction with the convergence results we get from the weak convergence methods. Besides ETD(λ), our analysis also applies to the off-policy TD(λ) algorithm, when the divergence issue is avoided by setting λ sufficiently large. It yields, for that case, new results on the asymptotic convergence properties of constrained off-policy TD(λ) with constant or slowly diminishing stepsize.},

The multiple comparisons are usually performed using the mean-ranks test. The aim of this technical note is to discuss the inconsistencies of the mean-ranks post-hoc test with the goal of discouraging its use in machine learning as well as in medicine, psychology, etc.. We show that the outcome of the mean-ranks test depends on the pool of algorithms originally included in the experiment. In other words, the outcome of the comparison between algorithms A and B depends also on the performance of the other algorithms included in the original experiment. This can lead to paradoxical situations. For instance the difference between A and B could be declared significant if the pool comprises algorithms C, D, E and not significant if the pool comprises algorithms F, G, H. To overcome these issues, we suggest instead to perform the multiple comparison using a test whose outcome only depends on the two algorithms being compared, such as the sign-test or the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.},

We address this problem from a statistical point of view and provide a theoretical analysis of the accuracy of several natural estimators. To this end, the minimax rate of separation is investigated and its expression is obtained as a function of the sample size, noise level and dimension. We consider the cases of homoscedastic and heteroscedastic noise and establish, in each case, tight upper bounds on the separation distance of several estimators. These upper bounds are shown to be unimprovable both in the homoscedastic and heteroscedastic settings. Interestingly, these bounds demonstrate that a phase transition occurs when the dimension $d$ of the features is of the order of the logarithm of the number of features $n$. For $d=O(\log n)$, the rate is dimension free and equals $\sigma (\log n)^{1/2}$, where $\sigma$ is the noise level. In contrast, when $d$ is larger than $c\log n$ for some constant $c>0$, the minimax rate increases with $d$ and is of the order $\sigma(d\log n)^{1/4}$. We also discuss the computational aspects of the estimators and provide empirical evidence of their consistency on synthetic data. Finally, we show that our results extend to more general matching criteria.},

However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximised over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximising an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the non-linear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain or partially missing inputs. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high resolution video data.},

 abstract = {We explore the effect of introducing prior information into the intermediate level of neural networks for a learning task on which all the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms tested failed to learn. We motivate our work from the hypothesis that humans learn such intermediate concepts from other individuals via a form of supervision or guidance using a curriculum. The experiments we have conducted provide positive evidence in favor of this hypothesis. In our experiments, a two-tiered MLP architecture is trained on a dataset with 64x64 binary inputs images, each image with three sprites. The final task is to decide whether all the sprites are the same or one of them is different. Sprites are pentomino tetris shapes and they are placed in an image with different locations using scaling and rotation transformations. The first part of the two-tiered MLP is pre-trained with intermediate-level targets being the presence of sprites at each location, while the second part takes the output of the first part as input and predicts the final task's target binary event. The two-tiered MLP architecture, with a few tens of thousand examples, was able to learn the task perfectly, whereas all other algorithms (include unsupervised pre-training, but also traditional algorithms like SVMs, decision trees and boosting) all perform no better than chance. We hypothesize that the optimization difficulty involved when the intermediate pre-training is not performed is due to the {\em composition} of two highly non-linear tasks. Our findings are also consistent with hypotheses on cultural learning inspired by the observations of optimization problems with deep learning, presumably because of effective local minima.},

Whereas the achievable limit in terms of regret minimization is now well known, our aim is to contribute to a better understanding of the performance in terms of identifying the m best arms. We introduce generic notions of complexity for the two dominant frameworks considered in the literature: fixed-budget and fixed-confidence settings. In the fixed-confidence setting, we provide the first known distribution-dependent lower bound on the complexity that involves information-theoretic quantities and holds when m is larger than 1 under general assumptions. In the specific case of two armed-bandits, we derive refined lower bounds in both the fixed-confidence and fixed-budget settings, along with matching algorithms for Gaussian and Bernoulli bandit models. These results show in particular that the complexity of the fixed-budget setting may be smaller than the complexity of the fixed-confidence setting, contradicting the familiar behavior observed when testing fully specified alternatives. In addition, we also provide improved sequential stopping rules that have guaranteed error probabilities and shorter average running times. The proofs rely on two technical results that are of independent interest : a deviation lemma for self-normalized sums (Lemma 19) and a novel change of measure inequality for bandit models (Lemma 1).},

 abstract = {The problem of clustering is considered for the case where every point is a time series. The time series are either given in one batch (offline setting), or they are allowed to grow with time and new time series can be added along the way (online setting). We propose a natural notion of consistency for this problem, and show that there are simple, computationally efficient algorithms that are asymptotically consistent under extremely weak assumptions on the distributions that generate the data. The notion of consistency is as follows. A clustering algorithm is called consistent if it places two time series into the same cluster if and only if the distribution that generates them is the same. In the considered framework the time series are allowed to be highly dependent, and the dependence can have arbitrary form. If the number of clusters is known, the only assumption we make is that the (marginal) distribution of each time series is stationary ergodic. No parametric, memory or mixing assumptions are made. When the number of clusters is unknown, stronger assumptions are provably necessary, but it is still possible to devise nonparametric algorithms that are consistent under very general conditions. The theoretical findings of this work are illustrated with experiments on both synthetic and real data.},

@article{JMLR:v17:maggioni16a,
 abstract = {High-dimensional datasets are well-approximated by low-dimensional structures. Over the past decade, this empirical observation motivated the investigation of detection, measurement, and modeling techniques to exploit these low-dimensional intrinsic structures, yielding numerous implications for high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and signal processing. Manifold learning (where the low-dimensional structure is a manifold) and dictionary learning (where the low-dimensional structure is the set of sparse linear combinations of vectors from a finite dictionary) are two prominent theoretical and computational frameworks in this area. Despite their ostensible distinction, the recently-introduced Geometric Multi-Resolution Analysis (GMRA) provides a robust, computationally efficient, multiscale procedure for simultaneously learning manifolds and dictionaries.

In this work, we prove non-asymptotic probabilistic bounds on the approximation error of GMRA for a rich class of data-generating statistical models that includes noisy manifolds, thereby establishing the theoretical robustness of the procedure and confirming empirical observations. In particular, if a dataset aggregates near a low-dimensional manifold, our results show that the approximation error of the GMRA is completely independent of the ambient dimension. Our work therefore establishes GMRA as a provably fast algorithm for dictionary learning with approximation and sparsity guarantees. We include several numerical experiments confirming these theoretical results, and our theoretical framework provides new tools for assessing the behavior of manifold learning and dictionary learning procedures on a large class of interesting models.},

 abstract = {Ever increasing data quantity makes ever more urgent the need for highly scalable learners that have good classification performance. Therefore, an out-of-core learner with excellent time and space complexity, along with high expressivity (that is, capacity to learn very complex multivariate probability distributions) is extremely desirable. This paper presents such a learner. We propose an extension to the k-dependence Bayesian classifier (KDB) that discriminatively selects a sub-model of a full KDB classifier. It requires only one additional pass through the training data, making it a three-pass learner. Our extensive experimental evaluation on 16 large data sets reveals that this out-of-core algorithm achieves competitive classification performance, and substantially better training and classification time than state-of-the-art in-core learners such as random forest and linear and non-linear logistic regression.},

A lot of recent effort has been devoted to developing distributed algorithms for these problems. However, these results suffer from high number of rounds, suboptimal approximation ratios, or both. We develop a framework for bringing existing algorithms in the sequential setting to the distributed setting, achieving near optimal approximation ratios for many settings in only a constant number of MapReduce rounds. Our techniques also give a fast sequential algorithm for non-monotone maximization subject to a matroid constraint.},

The practitioner can choose from a large variety of available similarity measures for this task, each emphasizing different aspects of the string data. In this article, we present Harry, a small tool specifically designed for measuring the similarity of strings. Harry implements over 20 similarity measures, including common string distances and string kernels, such as the Levenshtein distance and the Subsequence kernel. The tool has been designed with efficiency in mind and allows for multi-threaded as well as distributed computing, enabling the analysis of large data sets of strings. Harry supports common data formats and thus can interface with analysis environments, such as Matlab, Pylab and Weka.},

@article{JMLR:v17:su16a,
 abstract = {Algorithms for inferring the structure of Bayesian networks from data have become an increasingly popular method for uncovering the direct and indirect influences among variables in complex systems. A Bayesian approach to structure learning uses posterior probabilities to quantify the strength with which the data and prior knowledge jointly support each possible graph feature. Existing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for estimating these posterior probabilities are slow in mixing and convergence, especially for large networks. We present a novel Markov blanket resampling (MBR) scheme that intermittently reconstructs the Markov blanket of nodes, thus allowing the sampler to more effectively traverse low-probability regions between local maxima. As we can derive the complementary forward and backward directions of the MBR proposal distribution, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm can be used to account for any asymmetries in these proposals. Experiments across a range of network sizes show that the MBR scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, both in terms of learning performance and convergence rate. In particular, MBR achieves better learning performance than the other algorithms when the number of observations is relatively small and faster convergence when the number of variables in the network is large.},

@article{JMLR:v17:teh16a,
 abstract = {Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally expensive. Both the calculation of the acceptance probability and the creation of informed proposals usually require an iteration through the whole data set. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem by generating proposals which are only based on a subset of the data, by skipping the accept-reject step and by using decreasing step-sizes sequence (δm)m≥0.

We provide in this article a rigorous mathematical framework for analysing this algorithm. We prove that, under verifiable assumptions, the algorithm is consistent, satisfies a central limit theorem (CLT) and its asymptotic bias-variance decomposition can be characterized by an explicit functional of the step-sizes sequence (δm)m≥0. We leverage this analysis to give practical recommendations for the notoriously difficult tuning of this algorithm: it is asymptotically optimal to use a step-size sequence of the type δm = m-1/3, leading to an algorithm whose mean squared error (MSE) decreases at rate O(m-1/3).},

@article{JMLR:v17:yuille16a,
 abstract = {This paper performs a complexity analysis of a class of serial and parallel compositional models of multiple objects and shows that they enable efficient representation and rapid inference. Compositional models are generative and represent objects in a hierarchically distributed manner in terms of parts and subparts, which are constructed recursively by part-subpart compositions. Parts are represented more coarsely at higher level of the hierarchy, so that the upper levels give coarse summary descriptions (e.g., there is a horse in the image) while the lower levels represents the details (e.g., the positions of the legs of the horse). This hierarchically distributed representation obeys the executive summary principle, meaning that a high level executive only requires a coarse summary description and can, if necessary, get more details by consulting lower level executives. The parts and subparts are organized in terms of hierarchical dictionaries which enables part sharing between different objects allowing efficient representation of many objects. The first main contribution of this paper is to show that compositional models can be mapped onto a parallel visual architecture similar to that used by bio-inspired visual models such as deep convolutional networks but more explicit in terms of representation, hence enabling part detection as well as object detection, and suitable for complexity analysis. Inference algorithms can be run on this architecture to exploit the gains caused by part sharing and executive summary. Effectively, this compositional architecture enables us to perform exact inference simultaneously over a large class of generative models of objects. The second contribution is an analysis of the complexity of compositional models in terms of computation time (for serial computers) and numbers of nodes (e.g., neurons) for parallel computers. In particular, we compute the complexity gains by part sharing and executive summary and their dependence on how the dictionary scales with the level of the hierarchy. We explore three regimes of scaling behavior where the dictionary size (i) increases exponentially with the level of the hierarchy, (ii) is determined by an unsupervised compositional learning algorithm applied to real data, (iii) decreases exponentially with scale. This analysis shows that in some regimes the use of shared parts enables algorithms which can perform inference in time linear in the number of levels for an exponential number of objects. In other regimes part sharing has little advantage for serial computers but can enable linear processing on parallel computers.},

@article{JMLR:v17:zhang16a,
 abstract = {For spline regressions, it is well known that the choice of knots is crucial for the performance of the estimator. As a general learning framework covering the smoothing splines, learning in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) has a similar issue. However, the selection of training data points for kernel functions in the RKHS representation has not been carefully studied in the literature. In this paper we study quantile regression as an example of learning in a RKHS. In this case, the regular squared norm penalty does not perform training data selection. We propose a data sparsity constraint that imposes thresholding on the kernel function coefficients to achieve a sparse kernel function representation. We demonstrate that the proposed data sparsity method can have competitive prediction performance for certain situations, and have comparable performance in other cases compared to that of the traditional squared norm penalty. Therefore, the data sparsity method can serve as a competitive alternative to the squared norm penalty method. Some theoretical properties of our proposed method using the data sparsity constraint are obtained. Both simulated and real data sets are used to demonstrate the usefulness of our data sparsity constraint.},
