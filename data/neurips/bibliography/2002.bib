 abstract = {We show that two important properties of the primary visual cortex emerge when the principle of temporal coherence is applied to natural image sequences. The properties are simple-cell-like receptive fields and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs, which emerge when we apply two different approaches to temporal coherence. In the first approach we extract receptive fields whose outputs are as temporally coherent as possible. This approach yields simple-cell-like receptive fields (oriented, localized, multiscale). Thus, temporal coherence is an alternative to sparse coding in modeling the emergence of simple cell receptive fields. The second approach is based on a two-layer statistical generative model of natural image sequences. In addition to modeling the temporal coherence of individual simple cells, this model includes inter-cell temporal dependencies. Estimation of this model from natural data yields both simple-cell-like receptive fields, and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs. In this completely unsupervised learning, both layers of the generative model are estimated simultaneously from scratch. This is a significant improvement on earlier statistical models of early vision, where only one layer has been learned, and others have been fixed a priori.},

 abstract = {A longstanding goal of reinforcement learning is to develop non-parametric representations of policies and value functions that support rapid learning without suffering from interference or the curse of dimensionality. We have developed a trajectory-based approach, in which policies and value functions are represented nonparametrically along trajectories. These trajectories, policies, and value functions are updated as the value function becomes more accurate or as a model of the task is updated. We have applied this approach to periodic tasks such as hopping and walking, which required handling discount factors and discontinuities in the task dynamics, and using function approximation to represent value functions at discontinuities. We also describe extensions of the approach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.},

This enables the systematic derivation of algorithms customized for different models. Here, we describe the AUTOBAYES system which takes a high-level statistical model specification, uses powerful symbolic techniques based on schema-based program synthesis and computer algebra to derive an efficient specialized algorithm for learning that model, and generates executable code implementing that algorithm. This capability is far beyond that of code collections such as Matlab toolboxes or even tools for model-independent optimization such as BUGS for Gibbs sampling: complex new algorithms can be generated without new programming, algorithms can be highly specialized and tightly crafted for the exact structure of the model and data, and efficient and commented code can be generated for different languages or systems. We present automatically-derived algorithms ranging from closed-form solutions of Bayesian textbook problems to recently-proposed EM algorithms for clustering, regression, and a multinomial form of PCA.},

 abstract = {Pairwise data in empirical sciences typically violate metricity, either due to noise or due to fallible estimates, and therefore are hard to analyze by conventional machine learning technology. In this paper we therefore study ways to work around this problem. First, we present an alternative embedding to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that allows us to apply a variety of classical machine learning and signal processing algorithms. The class of pair-wise grouping algorithms which share the shift-in variance property is statistically invariant under this embedding procedure, leading to identical assignments of objects to clusters. Based on this new vectorial representation, denoising methods are applied in a second step. Both steps provide a theoretically well controlled setup to translate from pairwise data to the respective denoised metric representation. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our theoretical reasoning by discovering structure in protein sequence data bases, visibly improving performance upon existing automatic methods.},

The Fisher kernel view gives a more flexible insight into the string kernel and suggests how it can be parametrised in a way that reflects the statistics of the training corpus. Furthermore, the probabilistic modelling approach suggests extending the Markov process to consider sub-sequences of varying length, rather than the standard fixed-length approach used in the string kernel. We give a procedure for determining which sub-sequences are informative features and hence generate a Finite State Machine model, which can again be used to obtain a Fisher kernel. By adjusting the parametrisation we can also influence the weighting received by the features. In this way we are able to obtain a logarithmic weighting in a Fisher kernel. Finally, experiments are reported comparing the different kernels using the standard Rag of Words kernel as a baseline.},

 abstract = {The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data, in face of multiple conflicting structures, is inherent to modeling of complex data. Extracting structure in one random variable that is relevant for another variable has been principally addressed recently via the information bottleneck method [15]. However, such auxiliary variables often contain more information than is actually required due to structures that are irrelevant for the task. In many other cases it is in fact easier to specify what is irrelevant than what is, for the task at hand. Identifying the relevant structures, however, can thus be considerably improved by also minimizing the information about another, irrelevant, variable. In this paper we give a general formulation of this problem and derive its formal, as well as algorithmic, solution. Its operation is demonstrated in a synthetic example and in two real world problems in the context of text categorization and face images. While the original information bottleneck problem is related to rate distortion theory, with the distortion measure replaced by the relevant information, extracting relevant features while removing irrelevant ones is related to rate distortion with side information.},

Secondly, the complexity of the classification task is significantly reduced by mapping the continuous motion trajectories to sequences of 'motion events'. And thirdly, all the network structures are simple and with the exception of the optical flow chip based on a Winner-Take-All (WTA) architecture. We demonstrate the application of the proposed generic system for a contactless man-machine interface that allows to write letters by visual motion.

 abstract = {Side-chain prediction is an important subtask in the protein-folding problem. We show that finding a minimal energy side-chain configuration is equivalent to performing inference in an undirected graphical model. The graphical model is relatively sparse yet has many cycles. We used this equivalence to assess the performance of approximate inference algorithms in a real-world setting. Specifically we compared belief propagation (BP), generalized BP (GBP) and naive mean field (MF).

In cases where exact inference was possible, max-product BP always found the global minimum of the energy (except in few cases where it failed to converge), while other approximation algorithms of similar complexity did not. In the full protein data set, max-product BP always found a lower energy configuration than the other algorithms, including a widely used protein-folding software (SCWRL).},

 abstract = {We develop a systems theoretical treatment of a behavioural system that interacts with its environment in a closed loop situation such that its motor actions influence its sensor inputs. The simplest form of a feedback is a reflex. Reflexes occur always too late; i.e., only after a (unpleasant, painful, dangerous) reflex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This defines an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary reflex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algorithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feedforward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.},

 abstract = {According to a series of influential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been confined to more abstract psychological models.},

Because of this requirement we define our method as quasi-unsupervised. After training, unbalanced images can be processed thanks to the preliminary conversion to grayscale of the input to the neural network. The results of an extensive experimentation demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform the other unsupervised methods in the state of the art being, at the same time, flexible enough to be supervisedly fine-tuned to reach performance comparable with those of the best supervised methods.},

We develop a real-time control system using the spiking activity of approximately 40 neurons recorded with an electrode array implanted in the arm area of primary motor cortex. In contrast to previous work, we develop a control-theoretic approach that explicitly models the motion of the hand and the probabilistic relationship between this motion and the mean firing rates of the cells in 70ms bins. We focus on a realistic cursor control task in which the subject must move a cursor to hit randomly placed targets on a computer monitor. Encoding and decoding of the neural data is achieved with a Kalman filter which has a number of advantages over previous linear filtering techniques. In particular, the Kalman filter reconstructions of hand trajectories in off-line experiments are more accurate than previously reported results and the model provides insights into the nature of the neural coding of movement.},

 abstract = {A common objective in learning a model from data is to recover its network structure, while the model parameters are of minor interest. For example, we may wish to recover regulatory networks from high-throughput data sources. In this paper we examine how Bayesian regularization using a product of independent Dirichlet priors over the model parameters affects the learned model structure in a domain with discrete variables. We show that a small scale parameter - often interpreted as equivalent sample size or strength - leads to a strong regularization of the model structure (sparse graph) given a sufficiently large data set. In particular, the empty graph is obtained in the limit of a vanishing scale parameter. This is diametrically opposite to what one may expect in this limit, namely the complete graph from an (unregularized) maximum likelihood estimate. Since the prior affects the parameters as expected, the scale parameter balances a trade-off between regularizing the parameters vs. the structure of the model. We demonstrate the benefits of optimizing this trade-off in the sense of predictive accuracy.},

 abstract = {Forward decoding kernel machines (FDKM) combine large-margin classifiers with hidden Markov models (HMM) for maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptive sequence estimation. State transitions in the sequence are conditioned on observed data using a kernel-based probability model trained with a recursive scheme that deals effectively with noisy and partially labeled data. Training over very large data sets is accomplished using a sparse probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) model based on quadratic entropy, and an on-line stochastic steepest descent algorithm. For speaker-independent continuous phone recognition, FDKM trained over 177 ,080 samples of the TlMIT database achieves 80.6% recognition accuracy over the full test set, without use of a prior phonetic language model.},

Building on the analysis of a restricted version of our model, we derive a general filtering rule based on the margin of a ridge regression estimator. While our rule may observe the label of a vector only by classfying the vector as relevant, experiments on a real-world document filtering problem show that the performance of our rule is close to that of the on-line classifier which is allowed to observe all labels. These empirical results are complemented by a theoretical analysis where we consider a randomized variant of our rule and prove that its expected number of mistakes is never much larger than that of the optimal filtering rule which knows the hidden linear model.},

 abstract = {Using a Markov chain perspective of spectral clustering we present an algorithm to automatically find the number of stable clusters in a dataset. The Markov chain's behaviour is characterized by the spectral properties of the matrix of transition probabilities, from which we derive eigenflows along with their halflives. An eigenflow describes the flow of probability mass due to the Markov chain, and it is characterized by its eigenvalue, or equivalently, by the halflife of its decay as the Markov chain is iterated. A ideal stable cluster is one with zero eigenflow and infinite half-life. The key insight in this paper is that bottlenecks between weakly coupled clusters can be identified by computing the sensitivity of the eigenflow's halflife to variations in the edge weights. We propose a novel EIGENCUTS algorithm to perform clustering that removes these identified bottlenecks in an iterative fashion.},

The RA scanner is based on a novel laser-based imaging technique which is sensitive to the optical characteristics of finger joint tissue. Based on the laser images, finger joints are classified according to whether the inflammatory status has improved or worsened. To perform the classification task, various linear and kernel-based systems were implemented and their performances were compared. Special emphasis was put on measures to reliably perform parameter tuning and evaluation, since only a very small data set was available. Based on the results presented in this paper, it was concluded that the RA scanner permits a reliable classification of pathological finger joints, thus paving the way for a further development from prototype to product stage.},

 abstract = {An essential step in understanding the function of sensory nervous systems is to characterize as accurately as possible the stimulus-response function (SRF) of the neurons that relay and process sensory information. One increasingly common experimental approach is to present a rapidly varying complex stimulus to the animal while recording the responses of one or more neurons, and then to directly estimate a functional transformation of the input that accounts for the neuronal firing. The estimation techniques usually employed, such as Wiener filtering or other correlation-based estimation of the Wiener or Volterra kernels, are equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation in a Gaussian-output-noise regression model. We explore the use of Bayesian evidence-optimization techniques to condition these estimates. We show that by learning hyper-parameters that control the smoothness and sparsity of the transfer function it is possible to improve dramatically the quality of SRF estimates, as measured by their success in predicting responses to novel input.},

 abstract = {Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are consistent with a model of cortical processing in which synchronous packets of spikes propagate stably from one neuronal population to the next.},

 abstract = {Many control problems take place in continuous state-action spaces, e.g., as in manipulator robotics, where the control objective is often defined as finding a desired trajectory that reaches a particular goal state. While reinforcement learning offers a theoretical framework to learn such control policies from scratch, its applicability to higher dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather limited to date. Instead of learning from scratch, in this paper we suggest to learn a desired complex control policy by transforming an existing simple canonical control policy. For this purpose, we represent canonical policies in terms of differential equations with well-defined attractor properties. By nonlinearly transforming the canonical attractor dynamics using techniques from nonparametric regression, almost arbitrary new nonlinear policies can be generated without losing the stability properties of the canonical system. We demonstrate our techniques in the context of learning a set of movement skills for a humanoid robot from demonstrations of a human teacher. Policies are acquired rapidly, and, due to the properties of well formulated differential equations, can be re-used and modified on-line under dynamic changes of the environment. The linear parameterization of nonparametric regression moreover lends itself to recognize and classify previously learned movement skills. Evaluations in simulations and on an actual 30 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot exemplify the feasibility and robustness of our approach.},

Here we describe new separation algorithms which are based on probabilistic graphical models with latent variables. In contrast with existing methods, these algorithms exploit detailed models to describe source properties.

We present a computational model of spiny neurons, the principal neurons of the striatum, to assess the hypothesis that direct neuromodulatory effects of dopamine through the activation of Dl receptors mediate the reward dependency of spiny neuron activity. Dopamine release results in the amplification of key ion currents, leading to the emergence of bistability, which not only modulates the peak firing rate but also introduces a temporal and state dependence of the model's response, thus improving the detectability of temporally correlated inputs.},

 abstract = {A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classification is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identified previously. Further, we find that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells.},

 abstract = {The goal of low-level vision is to estimate an underlying scene, given an observed image. Real-world scenes (eg, albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate and store. We propose a low-dimensional representation, called a scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to describe the complex scene configurations. Shape recipes are an example: these are the regression coefficients that predict the bandpassed shape from image data. We describe the benefits of this representation, and show two uses illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution; (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting and materials and we use them for material segmentation.},

 abstract = {Particle filters estimate the state of dynamic systems from sensor information. In many real-time applications of particle filters, however, sensor information arrives at a significantly higher rate than the update rate of the filter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle filter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle filters, which make use of all sensor information even when the filter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by representing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a filter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources on valuable sensor information. Experiments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.},

Most non-parametric methods take this similarity to be fixed, but much recent work has shown the advantages of learning it, in particular to exploit the local invariances in the data or to capture the possibly non-linear manifold on which most of the data lies. We propose a new non-parametric kernel density estimation method which captures the local structure of an underlying manifold through the leading eigenvectors of regularized local covariance matrices. Experiments in density estimation show significant improvements with respect to Parzen density estimators. The density estimators can also be used within Bayes classifiers, yielding classification rates similar to SVMs and much superior to the Parzen classifier.},

 abstract = {Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes. We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole episodes, and depends only on when these start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to define what firing episodes are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in superficial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).},

Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a high-dimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efficient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efficient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4].},

 abstract = {We have implemented a real time front end for detecting voiced speech and estimating its fundamental frequency. The front end performs the signal processing for voice-driven agents that attend to the pitch contours of human speech and provide continuous audiovisual feedback. The algorithm we use for pitch tracking has several distinguishing features: it makes no use of FFTs or autocorrelation at the pitch period; it updates the pitch incrementally on a sample-by-sample basis; it avoids peak picking and does not require interpolation in time or frequency to obtain high resolution estimates; and it works reliably over a four octave range, in real time, without the need for postprocessing to produce smooth contours. The algorithm is based on two simple ideas in neural computation: the introduction of a purposeful nonlinearity, and the error signal of a least squares fit. The pitch tracker is used in two real time multimedia applications: a voice-to-MIDI player that synthesizes electronic music from vocalized melodies, and an audiovisual Karaoke machine with multimodal feedback. Both applications run on a laptop and display the user's pitch scrolling across the screen as he or she sings into the computer.},

The Fisher score is a vector of parameter derivatives of loglikelihood of a probabilistic model. This paper gives a theoretical analysis about how class information is preserved in the space of the Fisher score, which turns out that the Fisher score consists of a few important dimensions with class information and many nuisance dimensions. When we perform clustering with the Fisher score, K-Means type methods are obviously inappropriate because they make use of all dimensions. So we will develop a novel but simple clustering algorithm specialized for the Fisher score, which can exploit important dimensions.

 abstract = {We present a new method for learning good strategies in zero-sum Markov games in which each side is composed of multiple agents collaborating against an opposing team of agents. Our method requires full observability and communication during learning, but the learned policies can be executed in a distributed manner. The value function is represented as a factored linear architecture and its structure determines the necessary computational resources and communication bandwidth. This approach permits a tradeoff between simple representations with little or no communication between agents and complex, computationally intensive representations with extensive coordination between agents. Thus, we provide a principled means of using approximation to combat the exponential blowup in the joint action space of the participants. The approach is demonstrated with an example that shows the efficiency gains over naive enumeration.},

 abstract = {We analyze the convergence properties of three spike-triggered data analysis techniques. All of our results are obtained in the setting of a (possibly multidimensional) linear-nonlinear (LN) cascade model for stimulus-driven neural activity. We start by giving exact rate of convergence results for the common spike-triggered average (STA) technique. Next, we analyze a spike-triggered covariance method, variants of which have been recently exploited successfully by Bialek, Simoncelli, and colleagues. These first two methods suffer from extraneous conditions on their convergence; therefore, we introduce an estimator for the LN model parameters which is designed to be consistent under general conditions. We provide an algorithm for the computation of this estimator and derive its rate of convergence. We close with a brief discussion of the efficiency of these estimators and an application to data recorded from the primary motor cortex of awake, behaving primates.},

We have developed a variational Bayesian method to perform Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on high-dimensional data containing missing entries. Missing data are handled naturally in the Bayesian framework by integrating the generative density model. Modeling the distributions of the independent sources with mixture of Gaussians allows sources to be estimated with different kurtosis and skewness. The variational Bayesian method automatically determines the dimensionality of the data and yields an accurate density model for the observed data without overfitting problems. This allows direct probability estimation of missing values in the high dimensional space and avoids dimension reduction preprocessing which is not feasible with missing data.},

The second approach allows for k - 1 different margins where the sum of margins is maximized. This approach is shown to reduce to v-SVM when the number of classes k - 2. Both approaches are optimal in size of 2l where l is the total number of training examples.

However, these approaches do not take image transformations into account. As a result, they produce image codes that are redundant because the same feature is learned at multiple locations. We describe an algorithm for sparse coding based on a bilinear generative model of images. By explicitly modeling the interaction between image features and their transformations, the bilinear approach helps reduce redundancy in the image code and provides a basis for transformation-invariant vision. We present results demonstrating bilinear sparse coding of natural images. We also explore an extension of the model that can capture spatial relationships between the independent features of an object, thereby providing a new framework for parts-based object recognition.},

While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where sufficiently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The finite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting.},

 abstract = {We introduce a novel learning algorithm for binary classification with hyperplane discriminants based on pairs of training points from opposite classes (dyadic hypercuts). This algorithm is further extended to nonlinear discriminants using kernel functions satisfying Mercer's conditions. An ensemble of simple dyadic hypercuts is learned incrementally by means of a confidence-rated version of AdaBoost, which provides a sound strategy for searching through the finite set of hypercut hypotheses. In experiments with real-world datasets from the UCI repository, the generalization performance of the hypercut classifiers was found to be comparable to that of SVMs and k-NN classifiers. Furthermore, the computational cost of classification (at run time) was found to be similar to, or better than, that of SVM. Similarly to SVMs, boosted dyadic kernel discriminants tend to maximize the margin (via AdaBoost). In contrast to SVMs, however, we offer an on-line and incremental learning machine for building kernel discriminants whose complexity (number of kernel evaluations) can be directly controlled (traded off for accuracy).},

This derivative information can be in the form of priors specified by an expert or identified from perturbation data close to equilibrium. 2) It allows a seamless fusion of multiple local linear models in a consistent manner, inferring consistent models and ensuring that integrability constraints are met. 3) It improves dramatically the computational efficiency of Gaussian process models for dynamic system identification, by summarising large quantities of near-equilibrium data by a handful of linearisations, reducing the training set size - traditionally a problem for Gaussian process models.},

A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to define a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word bank, to have versions close to the images of both river and finance without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts.},

This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description length) systematically influences its learnability.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically. We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label. In contrast, naive methods degrade rapidly as more ambiguity is introduced into the labels.},

We pursue the hypothesis that the axonal caliber has evolved to minimize signal propagation delays, while keeping arbor volume to a minimum. We show that for a general cost function the optimal diameters of mother (d0) and daughter (d1, d2) branches at a bifurcation obey a branching law: d0v+2 + d2v+2. The derivation relies on the fact that the conduction speed scales with the axon diameter to the power v (v = 1 for myelinated axons and v = 0.5 for non-myelinated axons). We test the branching law on the available experimental data and find a reasonable agreement.},

 abstract = {Classification trees are one of the most popular types of classifiers, with ease of implementation and interpretation being among their attractive features. Despite the widespread use of classification trees, theoretical analysis of their performance is scarce. In this paper, we show that a new family of classification trees, called dyadic classification trees (DCTs), are near optimal (in a minimax sense) for a very broad range of classification problems. This demonstrates that other schemes (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) cannot perform significantly better than DCTs in many cases. We also show that this near optimal performance is attained with linear (in the number of training data) complexity growing and pruning algorithms. Moreover, the performance of DCTs on benchmark datasets compares favorably to that of standard CART, which is generally more computationally intensive and which does not possess similar near optimality properties. Our analysis stems from theoretical results on structural risk minimization, on which the pruning rule for DCTs is based.},

 abstract = {We propose a method that would allow for a rigorous statistical analysis of neural responses to natural stimuli, which are non-Gaussian and exhibit strong correlations. We have in mind a model in which neurons are selective for a small number of stimulus dimensions out of the high dimensional stimulus space, but within this subspace the responses can be arbitrarily nonlinear. Existing analysis methods are based on correlation functions between stimuli and responses, but these methods are guaranteed to work only in the case of Gaussian stimulus ensembles. As an alternative to correlation functions, we maximize the mutual information between the neural responses and projections of the stimulus onto low dimensional subspaces. The procedure can be done iteratively by increasing the dimensionality of this subspace. Those dimensions that allow the recovery of all of the information between spikes and the full unprojected stimuli describe the relevant subspace. If the dimensionality of the relevant subspace indeed is small, it becomes feasible to map out the neuron's input-output function even under fully natural stimulus conditions. These ideas are illustrated in simulations on model visual neurons responding to natural scenes.},

This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual coding in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms.

These applications come from the areas of machine diagnostics, fault detection, illness identification or, in principle, refer to any problem where little knowledge is available outside the typical class. In this paper we explain why proximities are natural representations for domain descriptors and we propose a simple one-class classifier for dissimilarity representations. By the use of linear programming an efficient one-class description can be found, based on a small number of prototype objects. This classifier can be made (1) more robust by transforming the dissimilarities and (2) cheaper to compute by using a reduced representation set.

Rows and columns of these matrices correspond to objects, where and objects may belong to different sets, and the entries in the matrix express the relationships between them. We interpret the matrix elements as being produced by an unknown kernel which operates on object pairs and we show that - under mild assumptions - these kernels correspond to dot products in some (unknown) feature space. Minimizing a bound for the generalization error of a linear classifier which has been obtained using covering numbers we derive an objective function for model selection according to the principle of structural risk minimization. The new objective function has the advantage that it allows the analysis of matrices which are not positive definite, and not even symmetric or square. We then consider the case that objects are interpreted as features. We suggest an additional constraint, which imposes sparseness on the objects and show, that the method can then be used for feature selection. Finally, we apply this method to data obtained from DNA microar-rays, where column objects correspond to samples, row objects correspond to genes and matrix elements correspond to expression levels. Benchmarks are conducted using standard one-gene classification and support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors after standard feature selection. Our new method extracts a sparse set of genes and provides superior classification results.},

Attempts to incorporate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic indexing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such similarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain positive results.},

 abstract = {By comparison to some other sensory cortices, the functional properties of cells in the primary auditory cortex are not yet well understood. Recent attempts to obtain a generalized description of auditory cortical responses have often relied upon characterization of the spectrotemporal receptive field (STRF), which amounts to a model of the stimulus-response function (SRF) that is linear in the spectrogram of the stimulus. How well can such a model account for neural responses at the very first stages of auditory cortical processing? To answer this question, we develop a novel methodology for evaluating the fraction of stimulus-related response power in a population that can be captured by a given type of SRF model. We use this technique to show that, in the thalamo-recipient layers of primary auditory cortex, STRF models account for no more than 40% of the stimulus-related power in neural responses.},

Working with a subset of active basis functions, the sparsity of the RVM solution will ensure that the number of basis functions and thereby the computational complexity is kept low. We also introduce a mean field approach to the intractable classification model that is expected to give a very good approximation to exact Bayesian inference and contains the Laplace approximation as a special case. We test the algorithms on two large data sets with O(103 - 104) examples. The results indicate that Bayesian learning of large data sets, e.g. the MNIST database is realistic.},

For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaussian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisation has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly complex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables.

 abstract = {How do cortical neurons represent the acoustic environment? This question is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as clicks or tone pips. Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties.

Here we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations and music. We have used in vivo whole cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations elicited by these stimuli. Whole cell recording reveals the total synaptic input to a neuron from all the other neurons in the circuit, instead of just its output—a sparse binary spike train—as in conventional single unit physiological recordings. Whole cell recording thus provides a much richer source of information about the neuron's response.

Many neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Here we analyze the linear component—the spectro-temporal receptive field (STRF)—of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the neuron's membrane potential. We find that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the simple tuning curve. We also find that in many cases, much of the neuron's response, although deterministically related to the stimulus, cannot be predicted by the linear component, indicating the presence of as-yet-uncharacterized nonlinear response properties.},

Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high resolution image to the observed low resolution images, using regularization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registration parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-re solution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images.

We derive a learning algorithm using a maximum likelihood approach given the observed single channel data and sets of basis filters. For each time point we infer the source signals and their contribution factors. This inference is possible due to the prior knowledge of the basis filters and the associated coefficient densities.

The system uses a variant of co-training to exploit unlabeled data from a new site.

For each new application, however, it is currently necessary first to derive the variational update equations, and then to implement them in application-specific code. Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. In this paper we describe a general purpose inference engine called VIBES ('Variational Inference for Bayesian Networks') which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are specified either through a simple script or via a graphical interface analogous to a drawing package. VIBES then automatically generates and solves the variational equations. We illustrate the power and flexibility of VIBES using examples from Bayesian mixture modelling.},

 abstract = {Standard value function approaches to finding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is due to a great extent to their generating an optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real POMDP problems most belief states are unlikely, and there is a structured, low-dimensional manifold of plausible beliefs embedded in the high-dimensional belief space.

We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by taking advantage of belief space sparsity. We reduce the dimensionality of the belief space by exponential family Principal Components Analysis [1], which allows us to turn the sparse, high-dimensional belief space into a compact, low-dimensional representation in terms of learned features of the belief state. We then plan directly on the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in a low-dimensional space, we can find policies for POMDPs that are orders of magnitude larger than can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and also on a mobile robot navigation task.},

 abstract = {We propose a framework for classifier design based on discriminative densities for representation of the differences of the class-conditional distributions in a way that is optimal for classification. The densities are selected from a parametrized set by constrained maximization of some objective function which measures the average (bounded) difference, i.e. the contrast between discriminative densities. We show that maximization of the contrast is equivalent to minimization of an approximation of the Bayes risk. Therefore using suitable classes of probability density functions, the resulting maximum contrast classifiers (MCCs) can approximate the Bayes rule for the general multiclass case. In particular for a certain parametrization of the density functions we obtain MCCs which have the same functional form as the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We show that MCC-training in general requires some nonlinear optimization but under certain conditions the problem is concave and can be tackled by a single linear program. We indicate the close relation between SVM- and MCC-training and in particular we show that Linear Programming Machines can be viewed as an approximate realization of MCCs. In the experiments on benchmark data sets, the MCC shows a competitive classification performance.},

Specifically, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochastic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representational scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.},

 abstract = {Recently, interest is growing to develop an effective communication interface connecting the human brain to a computer, the 'Brain-Computer Interface' (BCI). One motivation of BCI research is to provide a new communication channel substituting normal motor output in patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities. In the last decade, various neuro-physiological cortical processes, such as slow potential shifts, movement related potentials (MRPs) or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of spontaneous EEG rhythms, were shown to be suitable for BCI, and, consequently, different independent approaches of extracting BCI-relevant EEG-features for single-trial analysis are under investigation. Here, we present and systematically compare several concepts for combining such EEG-features to improve the single-trial classification. Feature combinations are evaluated on movement imagination experiments with 3 subjects where EEG-features are based on either MRPs or ERD, or both. Those combination methods that incorporate the assumption that the single EEG-features are physiologically mutually independent outperform the plain method of 'adding' evidence where the single-feature vectors are simply concatenated. These results strengthen the hypothesis that MRP and ERD reflect at least partially independent aspects of cortical processes and open a new perspective to boost BCI effectiveness.},

By extracting and examining morphologically rich subsets of an input lexicon, the directed search identifies highly productive paradigms. The hill-climbing algorithm then further maximizes the probability of the hypothesis. Quantitative results are shown by measuring the accuracy of the morphological relations identified. Experiments in English and Polish, as well as comparisons with another recent unsupervised morphology learning algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.},

The output of this classifier provides the posterior probability of a boundary at each image location and orientation.

We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-pateh competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optima] partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.},

In this paper, we consider the average-cost criterion and a version of approximate linear programming that generates approximations to the optimal average cost and differential cost function. We demonstrate that a naive version of approximate linear programming prioritizes approximation of the optimal average cost and that this may not be well-aligned with the objective of deriving a policy with low average cost. For that, the algorithm should aim at producing a good approximation of the differential cost function. We propose a two-phase variant of approximate linear programming that allows for external control of the relative accuracy of the approximation of the differential cost function over different portions of the state space via state-relevance weights. Performance bounds suggest that the new algorithm is compatible with the objective of optimizing performance and provide guidance on appropriate choices for state-relevance weights.},

Even though maximum likelihood learning is intractable in our model, the product form allows a relatively efficient learning procedure that works well even for highly overcomplete sets of filters.

The concept of marginal diversity is introduced, leading to a generic principle for feature selection (the principle of maximum marginal diversity) of extreme computational simplicity. The relationships between infomax and the maximization of marginal diversity are identified, uncovering the existence of a family of classification procedures for which near optimal (in the Bayes error sense) feature selection does not require combinatorial search. Examination of this family in light of recent studies on the statistics of natural images suggests that visual recognition problems are a subset of it.},

 abstract = {Psychophysical data suggest that temporal modulations of stimulus amplitude envelopes play a prominent role in the perceptual segregation of concurrent sounds. In particular, the detection of an unmodulated signal can be significantly improved by adding amplitude modulation to the spectral envelope of a competing masking noise. This perceptual phenomenon is known as Comodulation Masking Release (CMR). Despite the obvious influence of temporal structure on the perception of complex auditory scenes, the physiological mechanisms that contribute to CMR and auditory streaming are not well known. A recent physiological study by Nelken and colleagues has demonstrated an enhanced cortical representation of auditory signals in modulated noise. Our study evaluates these CMR-like response patterns from the perspective of a hypothetical auditory edge-detection neuron. It is shown that this simple neural model for the detection of amplitude transients can reproduce not only the physiological data of Nelken et al., but also, in light of previous results, a variety of physiological and psychoacoustical phenomena that are related to the perceptual segregation of concurrent sounds.},

In this paper, under the condition that the true parameter is almost but not contained in singularities, we show two results. (1) If the dimension of the parameter from inputs to hidden units is not larger than three, then there exits a region of true parameters where the generalization error is larger than those of regular models, however, if otherwise, then for any true parameter, the generalization error is smaller than those of regular models.

 abstract = {Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many plausible ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to find one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufficiently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider similar. For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in ℝn, learns a distance metric over ℝn that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efficient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to significantly improve clustering performance.},

 abstract = {Given a set of hidden variables with an a-priori Markov structure, we derive an online algorithm which approximately updates the posterior as pairwise measurements between the hidden variables become available. The update is performed using Assumed Density Filtering: to incorporate each pairwise measurement, we compute the optimal Markov structure which represents the true posterior and use it as a prior for incorporating the next measurement. We demonstrate the resulting algorithm by calculating globally consistent trajectories of a robot as it navigates along a 2D trajectory. To update a trajectory of length t, the update takes O(t). When all conditional distributions are linear-Gaussian, the algorithm can be thought of as a Kalman Filter which simplifies the state covariance matrix after incorporating each measurement.},

We propose a sequential approach to adding features to a random field model by training them to improve classification performance between the data and an equal-sized sample of generated from the model's current estimate of the data density. Training in each boosting round proceeds in three stages: first we sample negative examples from the model's current Boltzmann distribution. Next, a feature is trained to improve classification performance between data and negative examples. Finally, a coefficient is learned which determines the importance of this feature relative to ones already in the pool. Negative examples only need to be generated once to learn each new feature. The validity of the approach is demonstrated on binary digits and continuous synthetic data.},

In this paper we investigate the problem of repeated synchronous updates based on a fixed set of transitions. Our main theorem yields sufficient conditions of convergence for combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms and linear function approximation. This allows to analyse if a certain reinforcement learning algorithm and a certain function approximator are compatible. For the combination of the residual gradient algorithm with grid-based linear' interpolation we show that there exists a universal constant learning rate such that the iteration converges independently of the concrete transition data.},

It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identifiers or when those identifiers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two observations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching—the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to define a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with specific methods for generating efficient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers.},

The scaling of our method is at most O(n · d2), and in large real-world classification experiments we show that it can match prediction performance of the popular support vector machine (SVM), yet can be significantly faster in training.

 abstract = {Accurate representation of articulated motion is a challenging problem for machine perception. Several successful tracking algorithms have been developed that model human body as an articulated tree. We propose a learning-based method for creating such articulated models from observations of multiple rigid motions. This paper is concerned with recovering topology of the articulated model, when the rigid motion of constituent segments is known. Our approach is based on finding the Maximum Likelihood tree shaped factorization of the joint probability density function (PDF) of rigid segment motions. The topology of graphical model formed from this factorization corresponds to topology of the underlying articulated body. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real motion capture data.},

 abstract = {Certain simple images are known to trigger a percept of transparency: the input image I is perceived as the sum of two images I(x,y) = I1(x,y) + I2(x,y). This percept is puzzling. First, why do we choose the more complicated description with two images rather than the simpler explanation I(x,y) = I1(x,y) + 0 ? Second, given the infinite number of ways to express I as a sum of two images, how do we compute the best decomposition?

Here we suggest that transparency is the rational percept of a system that is adapted to the statistics of natural scenes. We present a probabilistic model of images based on the qualitative statistics of derivative filters and corner detectors in natural scenes and use this model to find the most probable decomposition of a novel image. The optimization is performed using loopy belief propagation. We show that our model computes perceptually correct decompositions on synthetic images and discuss its application to real images.},

 abstract = {The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short English document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the first and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are completely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reflect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a specific meaning should correlate with certain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we first demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are significantly higher than random, and hence that a representation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should reflect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and significantly superior to LSI on the same data.},

However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features {[2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image.},

 abstract = {Monaural speech separation has been studied in previous systems that incorporate auditory scene analysis principles. A major problem for these systems is their inability to deal with speech in the high-frequency range. Psychoacoustic evidence suggests that different perceptual mechanisms are involved in handling resolved and unresolved harmonics. Motivated by this, we propose a model for monaural separation that deals with low-frequency and high-frequency signals differently. For resolved harmonics, our model generates segments based on temporal continuity and cross-channel correlation, and groups them according to periodicity. For unresolved harmonics, the model generates segments based on amplitude modulation (AM) in addition to temporal continuity and groups them according to AM repetition rates derived from sinusoidal modeling. Underlying the separation process is a pitch contour obtained according to psychoacoustic constraints. Our model is systematically evaluated, and it yields substantially better performance than previous systems, especially in the high-frequency range.},

 abstract = {We introduce a family of classifiers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classifiers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the v-SVM and the C-SVM. In the electrostatics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classification function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algorithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-definite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classifier in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and perform simulation studies to show that they are comparable or superior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classification tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise proximities, where a Coulomb Classifier outperformed standard SVMs.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of novelty detection, presenting an algorithm that aims to find a minimal region in input space containing a fraction α of the probability mass underlying a data set. This algorithm—the minimax probability machine (MPM)—is built on a distribution-free methodology that minimizes the worst-case probability of a data point falling outside of a convex set, given only the mean and covariance matrix of the distribution and making no further distributional assumptions. We present a robust approach to estimating the mean and covariance matrix within the general two-class MPM setting, and show how this approach specializes to the single-class problem. We provide empirical results comparing the single-class MPM to the single-class SVM and a two-class SVM method.},

 abstract = {Here we derive optimal gain functions for minimum mean square reconstruction from neural rate responses subjected to Poisson noise. The shape of these functions strongly depends on the length T of the time window within which spikes are counted in order to estimate the underlying firing rate. A phase transition towards pure binary encoding occurs if the maximum mean spike count becomes smaller than approximately three provided the minimum firing rate is zero. For a particular function class, we were able to prove the existence of a second-order phase transition analytically. The critical decoding time window length obtained from the analytical derivation is in precise agreement with the numerical results. We conclude that under most circumstances relevant to information processing in the brain, rate coding can be better ascribed to a binary (low-entropy) code than to the other extreme of rich analog coding.},

 abstract = {There exist many approaches to clustering, but the important issue of feature selection, i.e., selecting the data attributes that are relevant for clustering, is rarely addressed. Feature selection for clustering is difficult due to the absence of class labels. We propose two approaches to feature selection in the context of Gaussian mixture-based clustering. In the first one, instead of making hard selections, we estimate feature saliencies. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for this task. The second approach extends Koller and Sahami's mutual-information-based feature relevance criterion to the unsupervised case. Feature selection is then carried out by a backward search scheme. This scheme can be classified as a wrapper, since it wraps mixture estimation in an outer layer that performs feature selection. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that both methods have promising performance.},

 abstract = {AdaBoost [3] minimizes an upper error bound which is an exponential function of the margin on the training set [14]. However, the ultimate goal in applications of pattern classification is always minimum error rate. On the other hand, AdaBoost needs an effective procedure for learning weak classifiers, which by itself is difficult especially for high dimensional data. In this paper, we present a novel procedure, called FloatBoost, for learning a better boosted classifier. FloatBoost uses a backtrack mechanism after each iteration of AdaBoost to remove weak classifiers which cause higher error rates. The resulting float-boosted classifier consists of fewer weak classifiers yet achieves lower error rates than AdaBoost in both training and test. We also propose a statistical model for learning weak classifiers, based on a stagewise approximation of the posterior using an overcomplete set of scalar features. Experimental comparisons of FloatBoost and AdaBoost are provided through a difficult classification problem, face detection, where the goal is to learn from training examples a highly nonlinear classifier to differentiate between face and nonface patterns in a high dimensional space. The results clearly demonstrate the promises made by FloatBoost over AdaBoost.},

Relevance is measured by scale factors defining the input space metric, and feature selection is performed by assigning zero weights to irrelevant variables. The metric is automatically tuned by the minimization of the standard SVM empirical risk, where scale factors are added to the usual set of parameters defining the classifier. Feature selection is achieved by constraints encouraging the sparsity of scale factors. The resulting algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art feature selection procedures and demonstrates its effectiveness on a demanding facial expression recognition problem.},

We regard the parameters of the classifier as latent states in a first order Markov process and propose an algorithm which can be regarded as variational generalization of standard Kalman filtering. The variational Kalman filter is based on two novel lower bounds that enable us to use a non-degenerate distribution over the adaptation rate. An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of infering competitive classifiers both in stationary and non-stationary environments.

Maximum likelihood (ML) of mixture models is a standard statistical approach to clustering problems. In this paper, we ask: how are the two methods related? We define a simple mapping between the IB problem and the ML problem for the multinomial mixture model. We show that under this mapping the problems are strongly related. In fact, for uniform input distribution over or for large sample size, the problems are mathematically equivalent. Specifically, in these cases, every fixed point of the IB-functional defines a fixed point of the (log) likelihood and vice versa. Moreover, the values of the functionals at the fixed points are equal under simple transformations. As a result, in these cases, every algorithm that solves one of the problems, induces a solution for the other.},

 abstract = {We present the bump mixture model, a statistical model for analog data where the probabilistic semantics, inference, and learning rules derive from low-level transistor behavior. The bump mixture model relies on translinear circuits to perform probabilistic inference, and floating-gate devices to perform adaptation. This system is low power, asynchronous, and fully parallel, and supports various on-chip learning algorithms. In addition, the mixture model can perform several tasks such as probability estimation, vector quantization, classification, and clustering. We tested a fabricated system on clustering, quantization, and classification of handwritten digits and show performance comparable to the E-M algorithm on mixtures of Gaussians.},

 abstract = {In this paper we present results of a study on brain computer interfacing. We adopted an approach of Farwell & Donchin [4], which we tried to improve in several aspects. The main objective was to improve the transfer rates based on offline analysis of EEG-data but within a more realistic setup closer to an online realization than in the original studies. The objective was achieved along two different tracks: on the one hand we used state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for signal classification and on the other hand we augmented the data space by using more electrodes for the interface. For the classification task we utilized SVMs and, as motivated by recent findings on the learning of discriminative densities, we accumulated the values of the classification function in order to combine several classifications, which finally lead to significantly improved rates as compared with techniques applied in the original work. In combination with the data space augmentation, we achieved competitive transfer rates at an average of 50.5 bits/min and with a maximum of 84.7 bits/min.},

 abstract = {This paper investigates a boosting approach to discriminative learning of label sequences based on a sequence rank loss function. The proposed method combines many of the advantages of boosting schemes with the efficiency of dynamic programming methods and is attractive both, conceptually and computationally. In addition, we also discuss alternative approaches based on the Hamming loss for label sequences. The sequence boosting algorithm offers an interesting alternative to methods based on HMMs and the more recently proposed Conditional Random Fields. Applications areas for the presented technique range from natural language processing and information extraction to computational biology. We include experiments on named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging which demonstrate the validity and competitiveness of our approach.},

In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conflicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the first algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm's parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.},

 abstract = {Interpreting real-world images requires the ability distinguish the different characteristics of the scene that lead to its final appearance. Two of the most important of these characteristics are the shading and reflectance of each point in the scene. We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reflectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classifier trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, given the lighting direction, each image derivative is classified as being caused by shading or a change in the surface's reflectance. The classifiers gather local evidence about the surface's form and color, which is then propagated using the Generalized Belief Propagation algorithm. The propagation step disambiguates areas of the image where the correct classification is not clear from local evidence. We use real-world images to demonstrate results and show how each component of the system affects the results.},

More precisely, we give a fixed family of factored MDPs with linear rewards whose optimal policies and value functions simply cannot be represented succinctly in any standard parametric form. Previous hardness results indicated that computing good policies from the MDP parameters was difficult, but left open the possibility of succinct function approximation for any fixed factored MDP. Our result applies even to policies which yield a polynomially poor approximation to the optimal value, and highlights interesting connections with the complexity class of Arthur-Merlin games.},

 abstract = {We present ongoing work on a project for automatic recognition of spontaneous facial actions. Spontaneous facial expressions differ substantially from posed expressions, similar to how continuous, spontaneous speech differs from isolated words produced on command. Previous methods for automatic facial expression recognition assumed images were collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately faced the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. Here we explore an approach based on 3-D warping of images into canonical views. We evaluated the performance of the approach as a front-end for a spontaneous expression recognition system using support vector machines and hidden Markov models. This system employed general purpose learning mechanisms that can be applied to recognition of any facial movement. The system was tested for recognition of a set of facial actions defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We showed that 3D tracking and warping followed by machine learning techniques directly applied to the warped images, is a viable and promising technology for automatic facial expression recognition. One exciting aspect of the approach presented here is that information about movement dynamics emerged out of filters which were derived from the statistics of images.},

 abstract = {We describe a method for computing provably exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subclass of problems on graphs with cycles. The basic idea is to represent the original problem on the graph with cycles as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. A convexity argument then guarantees that the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) is upper bounded by the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is met with equality if and only if the tree problems share an optimal configuration in common. An important implication is that any such shared configuration must also be the MAP configuration for the original problem. Next we develop a tree-reweighted max-product algorithm for attempting to find convex combinations of tree-structured problems that share a common optimum. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for a fixed point to yield the exact MAP estimate. An attractive feature of our analysis is that it generalizes naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions.},
