 abstract = {First-order Markov models have been successfully applied to many problems, for example in modeling sequential data using Markov chains, and modeling control problems using the Markov decision processes (MDP) formalism. If a first-order Markov model's parameters are estimated from data, the standard maximum likelihood estimator considers only the first-order (single-step) transitions. But for many problems, the first-order conditional independence assumptions are not satisfied, and as a result the higher order transition probabilities may be poorly approximated. Motivated by the problem of learning an MDP's parameters for control, we propose an algorithm for learning a first-order Markov model that explicitly takes into account higher order interactions during training. Our algorithm uses an optimization criterion different from maximum likelihood, and allows us to learn models that capture longer range effects, but without giving up the benefits of using first-order Markov models. Our experimental results also show the new algorithm outperforming conventional maximum likelihood estimation in a number of control problems where the MDP's parameters are estimated from data.},

The method employs a convolutional network to map face images to points on a manifold, parametrized by pose, and non-face images to points far from that manifold. This network is trained by optimizing a loss function of three variables: image, pose, and face/non-face label. We test the resulting system, in a single configuration, on three standard data sets – one for frontal pose, one for rotated faces, and one for profiles – and find that its performance on each set is comparable to previous multi-view face detectors that can only handle one form of pose variation. We also show experimentally that the system's accuracy on both face detection and pose estimation is improved by training for the two tasks together.},

However, instead of focusing on the detection step we focus on the rejection step and show that our method is simple and fast to be learned, thus making it an excellent pre-processing step to accelerate standard machine learning classifiers, such as neural-networks, Bayes classifiers or SVM. We decompose a collection of face images into regions of pixels with similar behavior over the image set. The relationships between the mean and variance of image segments are used to form a cascade of rejectors that can reject over 99.8% of image patches, thus only a small fraction of the image patches must be passed to a full-scale classifier. Moreover, the training time for our method is much less than an hour, on a standard PC. The shape of the features (i.e. image segments) we use is data-driven, they are very cheap to compute and they form a very low dimensional feature space in which exhaustive search for the best features is tractable.},

Objects are modeled as flexible constellations of parts conditioned on local observations found by an interest operator. For each object class the probability of a given assignment of parts to local features is modeled by a Conditional Random Field (CRF). We propose an extension of the CRF framework that incorporates hidden variables and combines class conditional CRFs into a unified framework for part-based object recognition. The parameters of the CRF are estimated in a maximum likelihood framework and recognition proceeds by finding the most likely class under our model. The main advantage of the proposed CRF framework is that it allows us to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data (i.e. local features) often used in generative approaches, an assumption that might be too restrictive for a considerable number of object classes.},

Although this approach has met with considerable success, the causal semantics of these models can make it difficult to infer the posterior distribution over the hidden variables. In this paper we propose an alternative two-layer model based on family distributions and the semantics of undirected models. Inference in these exponential family harmoniums is fast while learning is performed by minimizing contrastive divergence. A member of this family is then studied as an alternative probabilistic model for latent semantic indexing.

 abstract = {We describe a three-dimensional geometric hand model suitable for visual tracking applications. The kinematic constraints implied by the model's joints have a probabilistic structure which is well described by a graphical model. Inference in this model is complicated by the hand's many degrees of freedom, as well as multimodal likelihoods caused by ambiguous image measurements. We use nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) to develop a tracking algorithm which exploits the graph's structure to control complexity, while avoiding costly discretization.

While kinematic constraints naturally have a local structure, self- occlusions created by the imaging process lead to complex interpendencies in color and edge-based likelihood functions. However, we show that local structure may be recovered by introducing binary hidden variables describing the occlusion state of each pixel. We augment the NBP algorithm to infer these occlusion variables in a distributed fashion, and then analytically marginalize over them to produce hand position estimates which properly account for occlusion events. We provide simulations showing that NBP may be used to refine inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences.},

 abstract = {This paper concerns approximate nearest neighbor searching algorithms, which have become increasingly important, especially in high dimensional perception areas such as computer vision, with dozens of publications in recent years. Much of this enthusiasm is due to a successful new approximate nearest neighbor approach called Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In this paper we ask the question: can earlier spatial data structure approaches to exact nearest neighbor, such as metric trees, be altered to provide approximate answers to proximity queries and if so, how? We introduce a new kind of metric tree that allows overlap: certain datapoints may appear in both the children of a parent. We also introduce new approximate k-NN search algorithms on this structure. We show why these structures should be able to exploit the same random-projection-based approximations that LSH enjoys, but with a simpler algorithm and perhaps with greater efficiency. We then provide a detailed empirical evaluation on five large, high dimensional datasets which show up to 31-fold accelerations over LSH. This result holds true throughout the spectrum of approximation levels.},

 abstract = {Statistical language models estimate the probability of a word occurring in a given context. The most common language models rely on a discrete enumeration of predictive contexts (e.g., n-grams) and consequently fail to capture and exploit statistical regularities across these contexts. In this paper, we show how to learn hierarchical, distributed representations of word contexts that maximize the predictive value of a statistical language model. The representations are initialized by unsupervised algorithms for linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction [14], then fed as input into a hierarchical mixture of experts, where each expert is a multinomial distribution over predicted words [12]. While the distributed representations in our model are inspired by the neural probabilistic language model of Bengio et al. [2, 3], our particular architecture enables us to work with significantly larger vocabularies and training corpora. For example, on a large-scale bigram modeling task involving a sixty thousand word vocabulary and a training corpus of three million sentences, we demonstrate consistent improvement over class-based bigram models [10, 13]. We also discuss extensions of our approach to longer multiword contexts.},

 abstract = {Amino acid profiles, which capture position-specific mutation probabilities, are a richer encoding of biological sequences than the individual sequences themselves. However, profile comparisons are much more computationally expensive than discrete symbol comparisons, making profiles impractical for many large datasets. Furthermore, because they are such a rich representation, profiles can be difficult to visualize. To overcome these problems, we propose a discretization for profiles using an expanded alphabet representing not just individual amino acids, but common profiles. By using an extension of information bottleneck (IB) incorporating constraints and priors on the class distributions, we find an informationally optimal alphabet. This discretization yields a concise, informative textual representation for profile sequences. Also alignments between these sequences, while nearly as accurate as the full profile-profile alignments, can be computed almost as quickly as those between individual or consensus sequences. A full pairwise alignment of SwissProt would take years using profiles, but less than 3 days using a discrete IB encoding, illustrating how discrete encoding can expand the range of sequence problems to which profile information can be applied.},

 abstract = {The problem of detecting atypical objects or is one of the classical topics in (robust) statistics. Recently, it has been proposed to address this problem by means of one-class SVM classifiers. The main conceptual shortcoming of most one-class approaches, however, is that in a strict sense they are unable to detect outliers, since the expected fraction of outliers has to be specified in advance. The method presented in this paper overcomes this problem by relating kernelized one-class classification to Gaussian density estimation in the induced feature space. Having established this relation, it is possible to identify atypical objects by quantifying their deviations from the Gaussian model. For RBF kernels it is shown that the Gaussian model is rich enough in the sense that it asymptotically provides an unbiased estimator for the true density. In order to overcome the inherent model selection problem, a cross-validated likelihood criterion for selecting all free model parameters is applied.},

PE has many potential uses depending on the source of the input data, providing insight into the classifier's behavior in supervised, semisupervised, and unsupervised settings. The PE algorithm has a computational advantage over conventional embedding methods based on pairwise object relations since its complexity scales with the product of the number of objects and the number of classes. We demonstrate PE by visualizing supervised categorization of Web pages, semisupervised categorization of digits, and the relations of words and latent topics found by an unsupervised algorithm, latent Dirichlet allocation.},

In many real world settings, however, this assumption is not valid, because a topographical relationship exists between the objects. In this contribution we consider the special case of image segmentation, where the objects are pixels and where the underlying topography is a 2D regular rectangular grid. We introduce a classification method which not only uses measured vectorial feature information but also the label configuration within a topographic neighborhood. Due to the resulting dependence between the labels of neighboring pixels, a collective classification of a set of pixels becomes necessary. We propose a new method called 'Topographic Support Vector Machine' (TSVM), which is based on a topographic kernel and a self-consistent solution to the label assignment shown to be equivalent to a recurrent neural network. The performance of the algorithm is compared to a conventional SVM on a cell image segmentation task.},

 abstract = {We propose a new set of criteria for learning algorithms in multi-agent systems, one that is more stringent and (we argue) better justified than previous proposed criteria. Our criteria, which apply most straightforwardly in repeated games with average rewards, consist of three requirements: (a) against a specified class of opponents (this class is a parameter of the criterion) the algorithm yield a payoff that approaches the payoff of the best response, (b) against other opponents the algorithm's payoff at least approach (and possibly exceed) the security level payoff (or max-imin value), and (c) subject to these requirements, the algorithm achieve a close to optimal payoff in self-play. We furthermore require that these average payoffs be achieved quickly. We then present a novel algorithm, and show that it meets these new criteria for a particular parameter class, the class of stationary opponents. Finally, we show that the algorithm is effective not only in theory, but also empirically. Using a recently introduced comprehensive game theoretic test suite, we show that the algorithm almost universally outperforms previous learning algorithms.},

One of the most time-consuming steps in the crystallographic process is interpretation of the electron density map, a task that involves finding patterns in a three-dimensional picture of a protein. This paper describes DEFT (DEFormable Template), an algorithm using pictorial structures to build a flexible protein model from the protein's amino-acid sequence. Matching this pictorial structure into the density map is a way of automating density-map interpretation. Also described are several extensions to the pictorial structure matching algorithm necessary for this automated interpretation. DEFT is tested on a set of density maps ranging from 2 to 4A resolution, producing root-mean-squared errors ranging from 1.38 to 1.84A.},

Real-world planning problems often exhibit uncertainty, which forces us to use the slower algorithms to solve them. Many real-world planning problems exhibit sparse uncertainty: there are long sequences of deterministic actions which accomplish tasks like moving sensor platforms into place, interspersed with a small number of sensing actions which have uncertain outcomes. In this paper we describe a new planning algorithm, called MCP (short for MDP Compression Planning), which combines A* search with value iteration for solving Stochastic Shortest Path problem in MDPs with sparse stochasticity. We present experiments which show that MCP can run substantially faster than competing planners in domains with sparse uncertainty; these experiments are based on a simulation of a ground robot cooperating with a helicopter to fill in a partial map and move to a goal location.},

This framework is based on a free energy (negative log marginal likelihood) and can be seen as a generalization of adaptive TAP [1, 2, 3] and expectation propagation (EP) [4, 5]. The free energy is constructed from two approximating distributions which encode different aspects of the intractable model such a single node constraints and couplings and are by construction consistent on a chosen set of moments. We test the framework on a difficult benchmark problem with binary variables on fully connected graphs and 2D grid graphs. We find good performance using sets of moments which either specify factorized nodes or a spanning tree on the nodes (structured approximation). Surprisingly, the Bethe approximation gives very inferior results even on grids.},

In this paper, we look for tasks where machine learning algorithms are not as good as humans with the hope of gaining insight into their current limitations. We studied various Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) on the market, because they are systems designed to tell computers and humans apart by posing challenges presumably too hard for computers. We found that most HIPs are pure recognition tasks which can easily be broken using machine learning. The harder HIPs use a combination of segmentation and recognition tasks. From this observation, we found that building segmentation tasks is the most effective way to confuse machine learning algorithms. This has enabled us to build effective HIPs (which we deployed in MSN Passport), as well as design challenging segmentation tasks for machine learning algorithms.},

This results in flexible kernels and avoids the need to choose among different parametric forms. Our approach relies on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and is computationally feasible for large datasets. We evaluate the kernels on real datasets using support vector machines, with encouraging results.},

Given a noisy neural representation, however, solely reducing redundancy is not desirable, since redundancy is the only clue to reduce the effects of noise. Here we propose a model that best balances redundancy reduction and redundant representation. Like previous models, our model accounts for the localized and oriented structure of simple cells, but it also predicts a different organization for the population. With noisy, limited-capacity units, the optimal representation becomes an overcomplete, multi-scale representation, which, compared to previous models, is in closer agreement with physiological data. These results offer a new perspective on the expansion of the number of neurons from retina to V1 and provide a theoretical model of incorporating useful redundancy into efficient neural representations.},

Does this arrangement of inputs allow efficient readout of sensory information by the target cortical neuron? We address this issue by using simple modelling of neuronal population activity and information theoretic tools. We find that efficient synaptic information transmission requires that the tuning curve of the afferent neurons is approximately as wide as the spread of stimulus preferences of the afferent neurons reaching the target neuron. By meta analysis of neurophysiological data we found that this is the case for cortico-cortical inputs to neurons in visual cortex.

 abstract = {Semantic taxonomies such as WordNet provide a rich source of knowledge for natural language processing applications, but are expensive to build, maintain, and extend. Motivated by the problem of automatically constructing and extending such taxonomies, in this paper we present a new algorithm for automatically learning hypernym (is-a) relations from text. Our method generalizes earlier work that had relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify hypernym pairs. Using path features extracted from parse trees, we introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns. Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs. On our evaluation task (determining whether two nouns in a news article participate in a hypernym relationship), our automatically extracted database of hypernyms attains both higher precision and higher recall than WordNet.},

 abstract = {We present a generative model and stochastic filtering algorithm for simultaneous tracking of 3D position and orientation, non-rigid motion, object texture, and background texture using a single camera. We show that the solution to this problem is formally equivalent to stochastic filtering of conditionally Gaussian processes, a problem for which well known approaches exist [3, 8]. We propose an approach based on Monte Carlo sampling of the nonlinear component of the process (object motion) and exact filtering of the object and background textures given the sampled motion. The smoothness of image sequences in time and space is exploited by using Laplace's method to generate proposal distributions for importance sampling [7]. The resulting inference algorithm encompasses both optic flow and template-based tracking as special cases, and elucidates the conditions under which these methods are optimal. We demonstrate an application of the system to 3D non-rigid face tracking.},

To leverage the information contained in such noisy replicate sets, we need to align them in an appropriate way (for example, to allow the data to be properly combined by adaptive averaging). We present the Continuous Profile Model (CPM), a generative model in which each observed time series is a non-uniformly subsampled version of a single latent trace, to which local rescaling and additive noise are applied. After unsupervised training, the learned trace represents a canonical, high resolution fusion of all the replicates. As well, an alignment in time and scale of each observation to this trace can be found by inference in the model. We apply CPM to successfully align speech signals from multiple speakers and sets of Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry proteomic data.},

 abstract = {There is growing evidence from psychophysical and neurophysiological studies that the brain utilizes Bayesian principles for inference and decision making. An important open question is how Bayesian inference for arbitrary graphical models can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons. In this paper, we show that recurrent networks of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons can perform approximate Bayesian inference for dynamic and hierarchical graphical models. The membrane potential dynamics of neurons is used to implement belief propagation in the log domain. The spiking probability of a neuron is shown to approximate the posterior probability of the preferred state encoded by the neuron, given past inputs. We illustrate the model using two examples: (1) a motion detection network in which the spiking probability of a direction-selective neuron becomes proportional to the posterior probability of motion in a preferred direction, and (2) a two-level hierarchical network that produces attentional effects similar to those observed in visual cortical areas V2 and V4. The hierarchical model offers a new Bayesian interpretation of attentional modulation in V2 and V4.},

 abstract = {Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known method for feature extraction and dimension reduction. It has been used widely in many applications such as face recognition. Recently, a novel LDA algorithm based on QR Decomposition, namely LDA/QR, has been proposed, which is competitive in terms of classification accuracy with other LDA algorithms, but it has much lower costs in time and space. However, LDA/QR is based on linear projection, which may not be suitable for data with nonlinear structure. This paper first proposes an algorithm called KDA/QR, which extends the LDA/QR algorithm to deal with nonlinear data by using the kernel operator. Then an efficient approximation of KDA/QR called AKDA/QR is proposed. Experiments on face image data show that the classification accuracy of both KDA/QR and AKDA/QR are competitive with Generalized Discriminant Analysis (GDA), a general kernel discriminant analysis algorithm, while AKDA/QR has much lower time and space costs.},

We first propose that a 'local' scale should be used to compute the affinity between each pair of points. This local scaling leads to better clustering especially when the data includes multiple scales and when the clusters are placed within a cluttered background. We further suggest exploiting the structure of the eigenvectors to infer automatically the number of groups.

 abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is a widely used tool for classification. Many efficient implementations exist for fitting a two-class SVM model. The user has to supply values for the tuning parameters: the regularization cost parameter, and the kernel parameters. It seems a common practice is to use a default value for the cost parameter, often leading to the least restrictive model. In this paper we argue that the choice of the cost parameter can be critical. We then derive an algorithm that can fit the entire path of SVM solutions for every value of the cost parameter, with essentially the same computational cost as fitting one SVM model. We illustrate our algorithm on some examples, and use our representation to give further insight into the range of SVM solutions.},

 abstract = {Clustering and prediction of sets of curves is an important problem in many areas of science and engineering. It is often the case that curves tend to be misaligned from each other in a continuous manner, either in space (across the measurements) or in time. We develop a probabilistic framework that allows for joint clustering and continuous alignment of sets of curves in curve space (as opposed to a fixed-dimensional feature-vector space). The proposed methodology integrates new probabilistic alignment models with model-based curve clustering algorithms. The probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of consistent EM learning algorithms for the joint clustering-alignment problem. Experimental results are shown for alignment of human growth data, and joint clustering and alignment of gene expression time-course data.},

 abstract = {Various problems in machine learning, databases, and statistics involve pairwise distances among a set of objects. It is often desirable for these distances to satisfy the properties of a metric, especially the triangle inequality. Applications where metric data is useful include clustering, classification, metric-based indexing, and approximation algorithms for various graph problems. This paper presents the Metric Nearness Problem: Given a dissimilarity matrix, find the nearest matrix of distances that satisfy the triangle inequalities. For lp nearness measures, this paper develops efficient triangle fixing algorithms that compute globally optimal solutions by exploiting the inherent structure of the problem. Empirically, the algorithms have time and storage costs that are linear in the number of triangle constraints. The methods can also be easily parallelized for additional speed.},

 abstract = {The formation of disulphide bridges among cysteines is an important feature of protein structures. Here we develop new methods for the prediction of disulphide bond connectivity. We first build a large curated data set of proteins containing disulphide bridges and then use 2-Dimensional Recursive Neural Networks to predict bonding probabilities between cysteine pairs. These probabilities in turn lead to a weighted graph matching problem that can be addressed efficiently. We show how the method consistently achieves better results than previous approaches on the same validation data. In addition, the method can easily cope with chains with arbitrary numbers of bonded cysteines. Therefore, it overcomes one of the major limitations of previous approaches restricting predictions to chains containing no more than 10 oxidized cysteines. The method can be applied both to situations where the bonded state of each cysteine is known or unknown, in which case bonded state can be predicted with 85% precision and 90% recall. The method also yields an estimate for the total number of disulphide bridges in each chain.},

 abstract = {High retrieval precision in content-based image retrieval can be attained by adopting relevance feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms require that the user judges the quality of the results of the query by marking all the retrieved images as being either relevant or not. Then, the search engine exploits this information to adapt the search to better meet user's needs. At present, the vast majority of proposed relevance feedback mechanisms are formulated in terms of search model that has to be optimized. Such an optimization involves the modification of some search parameters so that the nearest neighbor of the query vector contains the largest number of relevant images. In this paper, a different approach to relevance feedback is proposed. After the user provides the first feedback, following retrievals are not based on k-nn search, but on the computation of a relevance score for each image of the database. This score is computed as a function of two distances, namely the distance from the nearest non-relevant image and the distance from the nearest relevant one. Images are then ranked according to this score and the top k images are displayed. Reported results on three image data sets show that the proposed mechanism outperforms other state-of-the-art relevance feedback mechanisms.},

 abstract = {We provide a method for mass meta-analysis in a neuroinformatics database containing stereotaxic Talairach coordinates from neuroimaging experiments. Database labels are used to group the individual experiments, e.g., according to cognitive function, and the consistent pattern of the experiments within the groups are determined. The method voxelizes each group of experiments via a kernel density estimation, forming probability density volumes. The values in the probability density volumes are compared to null-hypothesis distributions generated by resamplings from the entire unlabeled set of experiments, and the distances to the null-hypotheses are used to sort the voxels across groups of experiments. This allows for mass meta-analysis, with the construction of a list with the most prominent associations between brain areas and group labels. Furthermore, the method can be used for functional labeling of voxels.},

 abstract = {The NIPS 2003 workshops included a feature selection competition organized by the authors. We provided participants with five datasets from different application domains and called for classification results using a minimal number of features. The competition took place over a period of 13 weeks and attracted 78 research groups. Participants were asked to make on-line submissions on the validation and test sets, with performance on the validation set being presented immediately to the participant and performance on the test set presented to the participants at the workshop. In total 1863 entries were made on the validation sets during the development period and 135 entries on all test sets for the final competition. The winners used a combination of Bayesian neural networks with ARD priors and Dirichlet diffusion trees. Other top entries used a variety of methods for feature selection, which combined filters and/or wrapper or embedded methods using Random Forests, kernel methods, or neural networks as a classification engine. The results of the benchmark (including the predictions made by the participants and the features they selected) and the scoring software are publicly available. The benchmark is available at www.nipsfsc.ecs.soton.ac.uk for post-challenge submissions to stimulate further research.},

 abstract = {We propose a new method for clustering based on finding maximum margin hyperplanes through data. By reformulating the problem in terms of the implied equivalence relation matrix, we can pose the problem as a convex integer program. Although this still yields a difficult computational problem, the hard-clustering constraints can be relaxed to a soft-clustering formulation which can be feasibly solved with a semidefinite program. Since our clustering technique only depends on the data through the kernel matrix, we can easily achieve nonlinear clusterings in the same manner as spectral clustering. Experimental results show that our maximum margin clustering technique often obtains more accurate results than conventional clustering methods. The real benefit of our approach, however, is that it leads naturally to a semi-supervised training method for support vector machines. By maximizing the margin simultaneously on labeled and unlabeled training data, we achieve state of the art performance by using a single, integrated learning principle.},

In this work, we propose a simple biochemical system whose architecture mimics that of genetic regulation and whose components allow for in vitro implementation of arbitrary circuits. We use only two enzymes in addition to DNA and RNA molecules: RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribonuclease (RNase). We develop a rate equation for in vitro transcriptional networks, and derive a correspondence with general neural network rate equations [3]. As proof-of-principle demonstrations, an associative memory task and a feedforward network computation are shown by simulation. A difference between the neural network and biochemical models is also highlighted: global coupling of rate equations through enzyme saturation can lead to global feedback regulation, thus allowing a simple network without explicit mutual inhibition to perform the winner-take-all computation. Thus, the full complexity of the cell is not necessary for biochemical computation: a wide range of functional behaviors can be achieved with a small set of biochemical components.},

Configural learning experiments probe how animals discriminate and generalize between patterns of simultaneously presented stimuli (such as tones and lights) that are differentially predictive of reinforcement. Previous models of these issues have been successful more on a phenomenological than an explanatory level: they reproduce experimental findings but, lacking formal foundations, provide scant basis for understanding why animals behave as they do. We present a theory that clarifies seemingly arbitrary aspects of previous models while also capturing a broader set of data. Key patterns of data, e.g. concerning animals' readiness to distinguish patterns with varying degrees of overlap, are shown to follow from statistical inference.},

While humans can effortlessly retrieve 3D shape information, this inverse problem has turned out to be difficult to perform automatically. We introduce a framework based on level set surface reconstruction and shape models for achieving this goal. Through this merging, we obtain an efficient and robust method for reconstructing surfaces of an object category of interest.

The shape model includes surface cues such as point, curve and silhouette features. Based on ideas from Active Shape Models, we show how both the geometry and the appearance of these features can be modelled consistently in a multi-view context. The complete surface is obtained by evolving a level set driven by a PDE, which tries to fit the surface to the inferred 3D features. In addition, an a priori 3D surface model is used to regularize the solution, in particular, where surface features are sparse. Experiments are demonstrated on a database of real face images.},

 abstract = {Experimental studies have observed synaptic potentiation when a presynaptic neuron fires shortly before a postsynaptic neuron, and synaptic depression when the presynaptic neuron fires shortly after. The dependence of synaptic modulation on the precise timing of the two action potentials is known as spike-timing dependent plasticity or STDP. We derive STDP from a simple computational principle: synapses adapt so as to minimize the postsynaptic neuron's variability to a given presynaptic input, causing the neuron's output to become more reliable in the face of noise. Using an entropy-minimization objective function and the biophysically realistic spike-response model of Gerstner (2001), we simulate neurophysiological experiments and obtain the characteristic STDP curve along with other phenomena including the reduction in synaptic plasticity as synaptic efficacy increases. We compare our account to other efforts to derive STDP from computational principles, and argue that our account provides the most comprehensive coverage of the phenomena. Thus, reliability of neural response in the face of noise may be a key goal of cortical adaptation.},

 abstract = {Though semi-supervised classification learning has attracted great attention over past decades, semi-supervised classification methods may show worse performance than their supervised counterparts in some cases, consequently reducing their confidence in real applications. Naturally, it is desired to develop a safe semi-supervised classification method that never performs worse than the supervised counterparts. However, to the best of our knowledge, few researches have been devoted to safe semi-supervised classification. To address this problem, in this paper, we invent a safety-control mechanism for safe semi-supervised classification by adaptive tradeoff between semi-supervised and supervised classification in terms of unlabeled data. In implementation, based on our recent semi-supervised classification method based on class memberships (SSCCM), we develop a safety-aware SSCCM (SA-SSCCM). SA-SSCCM, on the one hand, exploits the unlabeled data to help learning (as SSCCM does) under the assumption that unlabeled data can help learning, and on the other hand, restricts its prediction to approach that of its supervised counterpart least-square support vector machine (LS-SVM) under the assumption that unlabeled data can hurt learning. Therefore, prediction by SA-SSCCM becomes a tradeoff between those by semi-supervised SSCCM and supervised LS-SVM, respectively, in terms of the unlabeled data. As in SSCCM, the optimization problem in SA-SSCCM can be efficiently solved by the alternating iterative strategy, and the iteration convergence can theoretically be guaranteed. Experiments over several real datasets show the promising performance of SA-SSCCM compared with LS-SVM, SSCCM, and off-the-shelf safe semi-supervised classification methods.},

 abstract = {The correction of bias in magnetic resonance images is an important problem in medical image processing. Most previous approaches have used a maximum likelihood method to increase the likelihood of the pixels in a single image by adaptively estimating a correction to the unknown image bias field. The pixel likelihoods are defined either in terms of a pre-existing tissue model, or non-parametrically in terms of the image's own pixel values. In both cases, the specific location of a pixel in the image is not used to calculate the likelihoods. We suggest a new approach in which we simultaneously eliminate the bias from a set of images of the same anatomy, but from different patients. We use the statistics from the same location across different images, rather than within an image, to eliminate bias fields from all of the images simultaneously. The method builds a multi-resolution non-parametric tissue model conditioned on image location while eliminating the bias fields associated with the original image set. We present experiments on both synthetic and real MR data sets, and present comparisons with other methods.},

This map serves as input to a lattice of spiking neurons with lateral connections. The dynamics of this recurrent network transforms the initial olfactory image into a spatio-temporal pattern that evolves and stabilizes into odor- and intensity-coding attractors. The model is validated using experimental data from an array of temperature-modulated gas sensors.

 abstract = {In this paper, we explore the use of Random Forests (RFs) in the structured language model (SLM), which uses rich syntactic information in predicting the next word based on words already seen. The goal in this work is to construct RFs by randomly growing Decision Trees (DTs) using syntactic information and investigate the performance of the SLM modeled by the RFs in automatic speech recognition.

RFs, which were originally developed as classifiers, are a combination of decision tree classifiers. Each tree is grown based on random training data sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest, and a random selection of possible questions at each node of the decision tree. Our approach extends the original idea of RFs to deal with the data sparseness problem encountered in language modeling.

RFs have been studied in the context of n-gram language modeling and have been shown to generalize well to unseen data. We show in this paper that RFs using syntactic information can also achieve better performance in both perplexity (PPL) and word error rate (WER) in a large vocabulary speech recognition system, compared to a baseline that uses Kneser-Ney smoothing.},

We also show that data from such experiments can be used to constrain both the likelihood and prior functions of the model. Specifically, we measured matching speeds and thresholds in a two-alternative forced choice speed discrimination task. Parametric fits to the data reveal that the likelihood function is well approximated by a LogNormal distribution with a characteristic contrast-dependent variance, and that the prior distribution on velocity exhibits significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and approximately follows a power-law function.},

 abstract = {Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a well-known scheme for feature extraction and dimension reduction. It has been used widely in many applications involving high-dimensional data, such as face recognition and image retrieval. An intrinsic limitation of classical LDA is the so-called singularity problem, that is, it fails when all scatter matrices are singular. A well-known approach to deal with the singularity problem is to apply an intermediate dimension reduction stage using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) before LDA. The algorithm, called PCA+LDA, is used widely in face recognition. However, PCA+LDA has high costs in time and space, due to the need for an eigen-decomposition involving the scatter matrices.

In this paper, we propose a novel LDA algorithm, namely 2DLDA, which stands for 2-Dimensional Linear Discriminant Analysis. 2DLDA overcomes the singularity problem implicitly, while achieving efficiency. The key difference between 2DLDA and classical LDA lies in the model for data representation. Classical LDA works with vectorized representations of data, while the 2DLDA algorithm works with data in matrix representation. To further reduce the dimension by 2DLDA, the combination of 2DLDA and classical LDA, namely 2DLDA+LDA, is studied, where LDA is preceded by 2DLDA. The proposed algorithms are applied on face recognition and compared with PCA+LDA. Experiments show that 2DLDA and 2DLDA+LDA achieve competitive recognition accuracy, while being much more efficient.},

 abstract = {In the analysis of natural images, Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM) have been used to account for the statistics of filter responses, and to inspire hierarchical cortical representational learning schemes. GSMs pose a critical assignment problem, working out which filter responses were generated by a common multiplicative factor. We present a new approach to solving this assignment problem through a probabilistic extension to the basic GSM, and show how to perform inference in the model using Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach on both synthetic and image data.},

 abstract = {Learning in a multiagent system is a challenging problem due to two key factors. First, if other agents are simultaneously learning then the environment is no longer stationary, thus undermining convergence guarantees. Second, learning is often susceptible to deception, where the other agents may be able to exploit a learner's particular dynamics. In the worst case, this could result in poorer performance than if the agent was not learning at all. These challenges are identifiable in the two most common evaluation criteria for multiagent learning algorithms: convergence and regret. Algorithms focusing on convergence or regret in isolation are numerous. In this paper, we seek to address both criteria in a single algorithm by introducing GIGA-WoLF, a learning algorithm for normal-form games. We prove the algorithm guarantees at most zero average regret, while demonstrating the algorithm converges in many situations of self-play. We prove convergence in a limited setting and give empirical results in a wider variety of situations. These results also suggest a third new learning criterion combining convergence and regret, which we call negative non-convergence regret (NNR).},

 abstract = {The representation of acoustic signals at the cochlear nerve must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require exquisite sensitivity in both time and frequency. Lewicki (2002) demonstrated that many of the filtering properties of the cochlea could be explained in terms of efficient coding of natural sounds. This model, however, did not account for properties such as phase-locking or how sound could be encoded in terms of action potentials. Here, we extend this theoretical approach with algorithm for learning efficient auditory codes using a spiking population code. Here, we propose an algorithm for learning efficient auditory codes using a theoretical model for coding sound in terms of spikes. In this model, each spike encodes the precise time position and magnitude of a localized, time varying kernel function. By adapting the kernel functions to the statistics natural sounds, we show that, compared to conventional signal representations, the spike code achieves far greater coding efficiency. Furthermore, the inferred kernels show both striking similarities to measured cochlear filters and a similar bandwidth versus frequency dependence.},

 abstract = {We introduce a novel active-learning scenario in which a user wants to work with a learning algorithm to identify useful anomalies. These are distinguished from the traditional statistical definition of anomalies as outliers or merely ill-modeled points. Our distinction is that the usefulness of anomalies is categorized subjectively by the user. We make two additional assumptions. First, there exist extremely few useful anomalies to be hunted down within a massive dataset. Second, both useful and useless anomalies may sometimes exist within tiny classes of similar anomalies. The challenge is thus to identify rare category records in an unlabeled noisy set with help (in the form of class labels) from a human expert who has a small budget of datapoints that they are prepared to categorize. We propose a technique to meet this challenge, which assumes a mixture model fit to the data, but otherwise makes no assumptions on the particular form of the mixture components. This property promises wide applicability in real-life scenarios and for various statistical models. We give an overview of several alternative methods, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses, and conclude with a detailed empirical analysis. We show that our method can quickly zoom in on an anomaly set containing a few tens of points in a dataset of hundreds of thousands.},

We would like such pairwise relations to influence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We fit the model parameters with EM.

We use a modification of the classical variational representation of the largest eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix, where cardinality is constrained, and derive a semidefinite programming–based relaxation for our problem. We also discuss Nesterov's smooth minimization technique applied to the semidefinite program arising in the semidefinite relaxation of the sparse PCA problem.

In problems with time-varying dynamics, online learning methods have also proved to be a powerful tool for automatically tracking and/or adapting to the changing circumstances. However, for safety-critical applications such as airplane flight, the adoption of these algorithms has been significantly hampered by their lack of safety, such as stability, guarantees. Rather than trying to show difficult, a priori, stability guarantees for specific learning methods, in this paper we propose a method for monitoring the controllers suggested by the learning algorithm online, and rejecting controllers leading to instability.

This expansion assumption in fact motivates the iterative nature of the original co-training algorithm, unlike stronger assumptions (such as independence given the label) that allow a simpler one-shot co-training to succeed. We also heuristically analyze the effect on performance of noise in the data. Predicted behavior is qualitatively matched in synthetic experiments on expander graphs.},

 abstract = {Alternative splicing (AS) is an important and frequent step in mammalian gene expression that allows a single gene to specify multiple products, and is crucial for the regulation of fundamental biological processes. The extent of AS regulation, and the mechanisms involved, are not well understood. We have developed a custom DNA microarray platform for surveying AS levels on a large scale. We present here a generative model for the AS Array Platform (GenASAP) and demonstrate its utility for quantifying AS levels in different mouse tissues. Learning is performed using a variational expectation maximization algorithm, and the parameters are shown to correctly capture expected AS trends. A comparison of the results obtained with a well-established but low through-put experimental method demonstrate that AS levels obtained from GenASAP are highly predictive of AS levels in mammalian tissues.},

In this framework, we motivate minimum entropy regularization, which enables to incorporate unlabeled data in the standard supervised learning. Our approach includes other approaches to the semi-supervised problem as particular or limiting cases. A series of experiments illustrates that the proposed solution benefits from unlabeled data. The method challenges mixture models when the data are sampled from the distribution class spanned by the generative model. The performances are definitely in favor of minimum entropy regularization when generative models are misspecified, and the weighting of unlabeled data provides robustness to the violation of the cluster assumption. Finally, we also illustrate that the method can also be far superior to manifold learning in high dimension spaces.},

Our goal is to find spatial regions (d-dimensional rectangles) where the ci are significantly higher than expected given bi. We focus on two applications: detection of clusters of disease cases from epidemiological data (emergency department visits, over-the-counter drug sales), and discovery of regions of increased brain activity corresponding to given cognitive tasks (from fMRI data). Each of these problems can be solved using a spatial scan statistic (Kulldorff, 1997), where we compute the maximum of a likelihood ratio statistic over all spatial regions, and find the significance of this region by randomization. However, computing the scan statistic for all spatial regions is generally computationally infeasible, so we introduce a novel fast spatial scan algorithm, generalizing the 2D scan algorithm of (Neill and Moore, 2004) to arbitrary dimensions. Our new multidimensional multiresolution algorithm allows us to find spatial clusters up to 1400x faster than the naive spatial scan, without any loss of accuracy.},

The field has mainly been driven by the needs of completely paralyzed patients to communicate. With a few exceptions, most human BCIs are based on extracranial electroencephalography (EEG). However, reported bit rates are still low. One reason for this is the low signal-to-noise ratio of the EEG [16]. We are currently investigating if BCIs based on electrocorticography (ECoG) are a viable alternative. In this paper we present the method and examples of intracranial EEG recordings of three epilepsy patients with electrode grids placed on the motor cortex. The patients were asked to repeatedly imagine movements of two kinds, e.g., tongue or finger movements. We analyze the classifiability of the data using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [18,21] and Recursive Channel Elimination (RCE) [11].},

 abstract = {Visual action recognition is an important problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a new method to probabilistically model and recognize actions of articulated objects, such as hand or body gestures, in image sequences. Our method consists of three levels of representation. At the low level, we first extract a feature vector invariant to scale and in-plane rotation by using the Fourier transform of a circular spatial histogram. Then, spectral partitioning [20] is utilized to obtain an initial clustering; this clustering is then refined using a temporal smoothness constraint. Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based clustering and density estimation in the subspace of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) are then applied to thousands of image feature vectors to obtain an intermediate level representation. Finally, at the high level we build a temporal multi-resolution histogram model for each action by aggregating the clustering weights of sampled images belonging to that action. We discuss how this high level representation can be extended to achieve temporal scaling in-variance and to include Bi-gram or Multi-gram transition information. Both image clustering and action recognition/segmentation results are given to show the validity of our three tiered representation.},

Rather than relating a single prediction to itself at a later time, as in conventional TD methods, a TD network relates each prediction in a set of predictions to other predictions in the set at a later time. TD networks can represent and apply TD learning to a much wider class of predictions than has previously been possible. Using a random-walk example, we show that these networks can be used to learn to predict by a fixed interval, which is not possible with conventional TD methods. Secondly, we show that if the inter-predictive relationships are made conditional on action, then the usual learning-efficiency advantage of TD methods over Monte Carlo (supervised learning) methods becomes particularly pronounced. Thirdly, we demonstrate that TD networks can learn predictive state representations that enable exact solution of a non-Markov problem. A very broad range of inter-predictive temporal relationships can be expressed in these networks. Overall we argue that TD networks represent a substantial extension of the abilities of TD methods and bring us closer to the goal of representing world knowledge in entirely predictive, grounded terms.},

We validate the proposed measures by comparing their prediction with direct evaluations of the computational performance of these microcircuit models. This procedure is applied first to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the spatial range of synaptic connections and with regard to the scale of synaptic efficacies in the circuit, and then to microcircuit models that differ with regard to the level of background input currents and the level of noise on the membrane potential of neurons. In this case the proposed method allows us to quantify differences in the computational power and generalization capability of circuits in different dynamic regimes (UP- and DOWN-states) that have been demonstrated through intracellular recordings in vivo.},

This paper provides confidence intervals for the AUC based on a statistical and combinatorial analysis using only simple parameters such as the error rate and the number of positive and negative examples. The analysis is distribution-independent, it makes no assumption about the distribution of the scores of negative or positive examples. The results are of practical use and can be viewed as the equivalent for AUC of the standard confidence intervals given in the case of the error rate.

Starting out, we explore the optimisation of a network sensitivity measure related to maximising the mutual information between input spike timings and output spike timings. Our derivations are analogous to those in ICA, except that the sensitivity of output timings to input timings is maximised, rather than the sensitivity of output 'firing rates' to inputs. ICA and related approaches have been successful in explaining the learning of many properties of early visual receptive fields in rate coding models, and we are hoping for similar gains in understanding of spike coding in networks, and how this is supported, in principled probabilistic ways, by cellular biophysical processes. For now, in our initial simulations, we show that our derived rule can learn synaptic weights which can unmix, or demultiplex, mixed spike trains. That is, it can recover independent point processes embedded in distributed correlated input spike trains, using an adaptive single-layer feedforward spiking network.},

 abstract = {Repeated spike patterns have often been taken as evidence for the synfire chain, a phenomenon that a stable spike synchrony propagates through a feedforward network. Inter-spike intervals which represent a repeated spike pattern are influenced by the propagation speed of a spike packet. However, the relation between the propagation speed and network structure is not well understood. While it is apparent that the propagation speed depends on the excitatory synapse strength, it might also be related to spike patterns. We analyze a feedforward network with Mexican-Hat-type connectivity (FMH) using the Fokker-Planck equation. We show that both a uniform and a localized spike packet are stable in the FMH in a certain parameter region. We also demonstrate that the propagation speed depends on the distinct firing patterns in the same network.},

In this paper we take a decision theoretic view of PSTs for the task of sequence prediction. Generalizing the notion of margin to PSTs, we present an online PST learning algorithm and derive a loss bound for it. The depth of the PST generated by this algorithm scales linearly with the length of the input. We then describe a self-bounded enhancement of our learning algorithm which automatically grows a bounded-depth PST. We also prove an analogous mistake-bound for the self-bounded algorithm. The result is an efficient algorithm that neither relies on a-priori assumptions on the shape or maximal depth of the target PST nor does it require any parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first provably-correct PST learning algorithm which generates a bounded-depth PST while being competitive with any fixed PST determined in hindsight.},

 abstract = {Spike sorting involves clustering spikes recorded by a micro-electrode according to the source neurons. It is a complicated task, which requires much human labor, in part due to the non-stationary nature of the data. We propose to automate the clustering process in a Bayesian framework, with the source neurons modeled as a non-stationary mixture-of-Gaussians. At a first search stage, the data are divided into short time frames, and candidate descriptions of the data as mixtures-of-Gaussians are computed for each frame separately. At a second stage, transition probabilities between candidate mixtures are computed, and a globally optimal clustering solution is found as the maximum-a-posteriori solution of the resulting probabilistic model. The transition probabilities are computed using local stationarity assumptions, and are based on a Gaussian version of the Jensen–Shannon divergence. We employ synthetically generated spike data to illustrate the method and show that it outperforms other spike sorting methods in a non-stationary scenario. We then use real spike data and find high agreement of the method with expert human sorters in two modes of operation: a fully unsupervised and a semi-supervised mode. Thus, this method differs from other methods in two aspects: its ability to account for non-stationary data, and its close to human performance.},

Rather than treating the most general case, we focus on two key applications that exemplify our methods: On-line learning with a simple square loss and finding a symmetric positive definite matrix subject to symmetric linear constraints. The updates generalize the Exponentiated Gradient (EG) update and AdaBoost, respectively: the parameter is now a symmetric positive definite matrix of trace one instead of a probability vector (which in this context is a diagonal positive definite matrix with trace one). The generalized updates use matrix logarithms and exponentials to preserve positive definiteness. Most importantly, we show how the analysis of each algorithm generalizes to the non-diagonal case. We apply both new algorithms, called the Matrix Exponentiated Gradient (MEG) update and DefiniteBoost, to learn a kernel matrix from distance measurements.},

 abstract = {We develop a family of upper and lower bounds on the worst-case expected KL loss for estimating a discrete distribution on a finite number m of points, given N i.i.d. samples. Our upper bounds are approximation-theoretic, similar to recent bounds for estimating discrete entropy; the lower bounds are Bayesian, based on averages of the KL loss under Dirichlet distributions. The upper bounds are convex in their parameters and thus can be minimized by descent methods to provide estimators with low worst-case error; the lower bounds are indexed by a one-dimensional parameter and are thus easily maximized. Asymptotic analysis of the bounds demonstrates the uniform KL-consistency of a wide class of estimators as c = N/m → ∞ (no matter how slowly), and shows that no estimator is consistent for c bounded (in contrast to entropy estimation). Moreover, the bounds are asymptotically tight as c → 0 or ∞, and are shown numerically to be tight within a factor of two for all c. Finally, in the sparse-data limit c → 0, we find that the Dirichlet-Bayes (add-constant) estimator with parameter scaling like - c log(c) optimizes both the upper and lower bounds, suggesting an optimal choice of the add-constant parameter in this regime.},

The analysis does not assume that the Bayesian algorithms' modeling assumptions are correct, and our bounds hold even if the data is adversarially chosen. For Gaussian linear regression (using logloss), our error bounds are comparable to the best bounds in the online learning literature, and we also provide a lower bound showing that Gaussian linear regression is optimal in a certain worst case sense.

The path is obtained by using numerical continuation techniques, and involves a running time complexity that is a constant times the complexity of solving the problem for one value of the regularization parameter. Working in the setting of kernel linear regression and kernel logistic regression, we show empirically that the effect of the block 1-norm regularization differs notably from the (non-block) 1-norm regularization commonly used for variable selection, and that the regularization path is of particular value in the block case.},

Arbitrary network topologies can be implemented by selectively routing address-events to specific internal or external targets according to a memory-based projective field mapping. The utility and versatility of the system is demonstrated by configuring it as a three-stage network that accepts input from an address-event imager, detects salient regions of the image, and performs spatial acuity modulation around a high-resolution fovea that is centered on the location of highest salience.},

 abstract = {A generative probabilistic model for objects in images is presented. An object consists of a constellation of features. Feature appearance and pose are modeled probabilistically. Scene images are generated by drawing a set of objects from a given database, with random clutter sprinkled on the remaining image surface. Occlusion is allowed.

We study the case where features from the same object share a common reference frame. Moreover, parameters for shape and appearance densities are shared across features. This is to be contrasted with previous work on probabilistic 'constellation' models where features depend on each other, and each feature and model have different pose and appearance statistics [1, 2]. These two differences allow us to build models containing hundreds of features, as well as to train each model from a single example. Our model may also be thought of as a probabilistic revisitation of Lowe's model [3, 4].

We propose an efficient entropy-minimization inference algorithm that constructs the best interpretation of a scene as a collection of objects and clutter. We test our ideas with experiments on two image databases. We compare with Lowe's algorithm and demonstrate better performance, in particular in presence of large amounts of background clutter.},

The Cascade SVM can be spread over multiple processors with minimal communication overhead and requires far less memory, since the kernel matrices are much smaller than for a regular SVM. Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x - 10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor. Parallel implementations on a cluster of 16 processors were tested with over 1 million vectors (2-class problems), converging in a day or two, while a regular SVM never converged in over a week.},

 abstract = {An important aspect of clustering algorithms is whether the partitions constructed on finite samples converge to a useful clustering of the whole data space as the sample size increases. This paper investigates this question for normalized and unnormalized versions of the popular spectral clustering algorithm. Surprisingly, the convergence of unnormalized spectral clustering is more difficult to handle than the normalized case. Even though recently some first results on the convergence of normalized spectral clustering have been obtained, for the unnormalized case we have to develop a completely new approach combining tools from numerical integration, spectral and perturbation theory, and probability. It turns out that while in the normalized case, spectral clustering usually converges to a nice partition of the data space, in the unnormalized case the same only holds under strong additional assumptions which are not always satisfied. We conclude that our analysis gives strong evidence for the superiority of normalized spectral clustering. It also provides a basis for future exploration of other Laplacian-based methods.},

 abstract = {We propose a gossip-based distributed algorithm for Gaussian mixture learning, Newscast EM. The algorithm operates on network topologies where each node observes a local quantity and can communicate with other nodes in an arbitrary point-to-point fashion. The main difference between Newscast EM and the standard EM algorithm is that the M-step in our case is implemented in a decentralized manner: (random) pairs of nodes repeatedly exchange their local parameter estimates and combine them by (weighted) averaging. We provide theoretical evidence and demonstrate experimentally that, under this protocol, nodes converge exponentially fast to the correct estimates in each M-step of the EM algorithm.},

 abstract = {We describe an approach to building brain-computer interfaces (BCI) based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and learning. We show how a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) can be used to infer probability distributions over brain- and body-states during planning and execution of actions. The DBN is learned directly from observed data and allows measured signals such as EEG and EMG to be interpreted in terms of internal states such as intent to move, preparatory activity, and movement execution. Unlike traditional classification-based approaches to BCI, the proposed approach (1) allows continuous tracking and prediction of internal states over time, and (2) generates control signals based on an entire probability distribution over states rather than binary yes/no decisions. We present preliminary results of brain- and body-state estimation using simultaneous EEG and EMG signals recorded during a self-paced left/right hand movement task.},

 abstract = {In this paper, linear multilayer ICA (LMICA) is proposed for extracting independent components from quite high-dimensional observed signals such as large-size natural scenes. There are two phases in each layer of LMICA. One is the mapping phase, where a one-dimensional mapping is formed by a stochastic gradient algorithm which makes more highly-correlated (non-independent) signals be nearer incrementally. Another is the local-ICA phase, where each neighbor (namely, highly-correlated) pair of signals in the mapping is separated by the MaxKurt algorithm. Because LMICA separates only the highly-correlated pairs instead of all ones, it can extract independent components quite efficiently from appropriate observed signals. In addition, it is proved that LMICA always converges. Some numerical experiments verify that LMICA is quite efficient and effective in large-size natural image processing.},

Identifying these sites is very important for drug and protein design. In this paper, we propose a computational method based on probabilistic relational model that attempts to address this task using high-throughput protein interaction data and a set of short sequence motifs. We learn the model using the EM algorithm, with a branch-and-bound algorithm as an approximate inference for the E-step. Our method searches for motifs whose presence in a pair of interacting proteins can explain their observed interaction. It also tries to determine which motif pairs have high affinity, and can therefore lead to an interaction. We show that our method is more accurate than others at predicting new protein-protein interactions. More importantly, by examining solved structures of protein complexes, we find that 2/3 of the predicted active motifs correspond to actual interaction sites.},

 abstract = {Many machine learning algorithms for clustering or dimensionality reduction take as input a cloud of points in Euclidean space, and construct a graph with the input data points as vertices. This graph is then partitioned (clustering) or used to redefine metric information (dimensionality reduction). There has been much recent work on new methods for graph-based clustering and dimensionality reduction, but not much on constructing the graph itself. Graphs typically used include the fully-connected graph, a local fixed-grid graph (for image segmentation) or a nearest-neighbor graph. We suggest that the graph should adapt locally to the structure of the data. This can be achieved by a graph ensemble that combines multiple minimum spanning trees, each fit to a perturbed version of the data set. We show that such a graph ensemble usually produces a better representation of the data manifold than standard methods; and that it provides robustness to a subsequent clustering or dimensionality reduction algorithm based on the graph.},

Our algorithm does not need markers, nor does it assume prior knowledge about object shape, the dynamics of its deformation, or scan alignment. The algorithm registers two meshes by optimizing a joint probabilistic model over all point-to-point correspondences between them. This model enforces preservation of local mesh geometry, as well as more global constraints that capture the preservation of geodesic distance between corresponding point pairs. The algorithm applies even when one of the meshes is an incomplete range scan; thus, it can be used to automatically fill in the remaining surfaces for this partial scan, even if those surfaces were previously only seen in a different configuration. We evaluate the algorithm on several real-world datasets, where we demonstrate good results in the presence of significant movement of articulated parts and non-rigid surface deformation. Finally, we show that the output of the algorithm can be used for compelling computer graphics tasks such as interpolation between two scans of a non-rigid object and automatic recovery of articulated object models.},

 abstract = {We show how to build hierarchical, reduced-rank representation for large stochastic matrices and use this representation to design an efficient algorithm for computing the largest eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvectors. In particular, the eigen problem is first solved at the coarsest level of the representation. The approximate eigen solution is then interpolated over successive levels of the hierarchy. A small number of power iterations are employed at each stage to correct the eigen solution. The typical speedups obtained by a Matlab implementation of our fast eigensolver over a standard sparse matrix eigensolver [13] are at least a factor of ten for large image sizes. The hierarchical representation has proven to be effective in a min-cut based segmentation algorithm that we proposed recently [8].},

Intuitively, a semi-CRF on an input sequence x outputs a segmentation of x, in which labels are assigned to segments (i.e., subsequences) of x rather than to individual elements xi of x. Importantly, features for semi-CRFs can measure properties of segments, and transitions within a segment can be non-Markovian. In spite of this additional power, exact learning and inference algorithms for semi-CRFs are polynomial-time—often only a small constant factor slower than conventional CRFs.

They heavily rely on the notion of what can be considered as local, how accurately the manifold can be approximated locally, and, last but not least, how the local structures can be patched together to produce the global parameterization. In this paper, we develop algorithms that address two key issues in manifold learning: 1) the adaptive selection of the local neighborhood sizes when imposing a connectivity structure on the given set of high-dimensional data points and 2) the adaptive bias reduction in the local low-dimensional embedding by accounting for the variations in the curvature of the manifold as well as its interplay with the sampling density of the data set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods for improving the performance of manifold learning algorithms using both synthetic and real-world data sets.},

This paper describes a method for embedding objects of different types, such as images and text, into a single common Euclidean space, based on their co-occurrence statistics. The joint distributions are modeled as exponentials of Euclidean distances in the low-dimensional embedding space, which links the problem to convex optimization over positive semidefinite matrices. The local structure of the embedding corresponds to the statistical correlations via random walks in the Euclidean space.

But much of the simplicity and success of these heuristics comes from using an appropriate cue order. For instance, the Take The Best heuristic uses validity order for cues, which requires considerable computation, potentially undermining the computational advantages of the simple decision mechanism. But many cue orders can achieve good decision performance, and studies of sequential search for data records have proposed a number of simple ordering rules that may be of use in constructing appropriate decision cue orders as well. Here we consider a range of simple cue ordering mechanisms, including tallying, swapping, and move-to-front rules, and show that they can find cue orders that lead to reasonable accuracy and considerable frugality when used with lexicographic decision heuristics.},

 abstract = {We describe a framework for learning an object classifier from a single example. This goal is achieved by emphasizing the relevant dimensions for classification using available examples of related classes. Learning to accurately classify objects from a single training example is often unfeasible due to overfitting effects. However, if the instance representation provides that the distance between each two instances of the same class is smaller than the distance between any two instances from different classes, then a nearest neighbor classifier could achieve perfect performance with a single training example. We therefore suggest a two stage strategy. First, learn a metric over the instances that achieves the distance criterion mentioned above, from available examples of other related classes. Then, using the single examples, define a nearest neighbor classifier where distance is evaluated by the learned class relevance metric. Finding a metric that emphasizes the relevant dimensions for classification might not be possible when restricted to linear projections. We therefore make use of a kernel based metric learning algorithm. Our setting encodes object instances as sets of locality based descriptors and adopts an appropriate image kernel for the class relevance metric learning. The proposed framework for learning from a single example is demonstrated in a synthetic setting and on a character classification task.},

We do this by first defining a decomposition tree representation for G, which is closely related to the junction-tree representation for G. We then give an algorithm which uses this representation to compute the optimal H ∈ H. Gavril [2] and Tarjan [3] have used graph separation properties to solve several combinatorial optimization problems when the size of the minimal separators in the graph is bounded. We present an extension of this technique which applies to some important choices of H even when the size of the minimal separators of G are arbitrarily large. In particular, this applies to problems such as finding an optimal subgraphical model over a (k - 1)-tree of a graphical model over a k-tree (for arbitrary k) and selecting an optimal subgraphical model with (a constant) d fewer edges with respect to KL-divergence can be solved in time polynomial in |V(G)| using this formulation.},

After collecting an auditory database of social interactions among a group of twenty-three people via wearable sensors (66 hours of data each over two weeks), we apply speech and conversation detection methods to the auditory streams. These methods automatically locate the conversations, determine their participants, and mark which participant was speaking when. We then model the joint turn-taking behavior as a Mixed-Memory Markov Model [1] that combines the statistics of the individual subjects' self-transitions and the partners' cross-transitions. The mixture parameters in this model describe how much each person's individual behavior contributes to the joint turn-taking behavior of the pair. By estimating these parameters, we thus estimate how much influence each participant has in determining the joint turn-taking behavior. We show how this measure correlates significantly with betweenness centrality [2], an independent measure of an individual's importance in a social network. This result suggests that our estimate of conversational influence is predictive of social influence.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a method for computing fast approximations to support vector decision functions in the field of object detection. In the present approach we are building on an existing algorithm where the set of support vectors is replaced by a smaller, so-called reduced set of synthesized input space points. In contrast to the existing method that finds the reduced set via unconstrained optimization, we impose a structural constraint on the synthetic points such that the resulting approximations can be evaluated via separable filters. For applications that require scanning large images, this decreases the computational complexity by a significant amount. Experimental results show that in face detection, rank deficient approximations are 4 to 6 times faster than unconstrained reduced set systems.},

 abstract = {We devise and experiment with a dynamical kernel-based system for tracking hand movements from neural activity. The state of the system corresponds to the hand location, velocity, and acceleration, while the system's input are the instantaneous spike rates. The system's state dynamics is defined as a combination of a linear mapping from the previous estimated state and a kernel-based mapping tailored for modeling neural activities. In contrast to generative models, the activity-to-state mapping is learned using discriminative methods by minimizing a noise-robust loss function. We use this approach to predict hand trajectories on the basis of neural activity in motor cortex of behaving monkeys and find that the proposed approach is more accurate than both a static approach based on support vector regression and the Kalman filter.},

In particular we propose a complexity measure which we find to assume its highest values near the edge of chaos, i.e. the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics. Furthermore we show that the proposed complexity measure predicts the computational capabilities very well: only near the edge of chaos are such networks able to perform complex computations on time series. Additionally a simple synaptic scaling rule for self-organized criticality is presented and analyzed.},

 abstract = {In this paper we show that it is possible to model sensory impressions of consumers about beef meat. This is not a straightforward task; the reason is that when we are aiming to induce a function that maps object descriptions into ratings, we must consider that consumers' ratings are just a way to express their preferences about the products presented in the same testing session. Therefore, we had to use a special purpose SVM polynomial kernel. The training data set used collects the ratings of panels of experts and consumers; the meat was provided by 103 bovines of 7 Spanish breeds with different carcass weights and aging periods. Additionally, to gain insight into consumer preferences, we used feature subset selection tools. The result is that aging is the most important trait for improving consumers' appreciation of beef meat.},

 abstract = {Online mechanism design (OMD) addresses the problem of sequential decision making in a stochastic environment with multiple self-interested agents. The goal in OMD is to make value-maximizing decisions despite this self-interest. In previous work we presented a Markov decision process (MDP)-based approach to OMD in large-scale problem domains. In practice the underlying MDP needed to solve OMD is too large and hence the mechanism must consider approximations. This raises the possibility that agents may be able to exploit the approximation for selfish gain. We adopt sparse-sampling-based MDP algorithms to implement e-efficient policies, and retain truth-revelation as an approximate Bayesian-Nash equilibrium. Our approach is empirically illustrated in the context of the dynamic allocation of WiFi connectivity to users in a coffeehouse.},

We give, using only probability arguments, a common derivation of survey propagation, belief propagation and several interesting hybrid methods. We then present numerical experiments which use WSAT (a widely used random-walk based SAT solver) to quantify the complexity of the 3-SAT formulae as a function of their parameters, both as randomly generated and after simplification, guided by survey propagation. Some properties of WSAT which have not previously been reported make it an ideal tool for this purpose -- its mean cost is proportional to the number of variables in the formula (at a fixed ratio of clauses to variables) in the easy-SAT regime and slightly beyond, and its behavior in the hard-SAT regime appears to reflect the underlying structure of the solution space that has been predicted by replica symmetry-breaking arguments. An analysis of the tradeoffs between the various methods of search for satisfying assignments shows WSAT to be far more powerful that has been appreciated, and suggests some interesting new directions for practical algorithm development.},

We present a probabilistic information transmission or PIT model that suggests both of these conditions are essential for access consciousness. Having successfully modeled data from the repetition priming literature in the past, we use the PIT model to account for data from two experiments on subliminal priming, showing that the model produces priming even in the absence of accessibility and reportability of internal states.
