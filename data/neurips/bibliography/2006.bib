 abstract = {We present a reduction framework from ordinal regression to binary classification based on extended examples. The framework consists of three steps: extracting extended examples from the original examples, learning a binary classifier on the extended examples with any binary classification algorithm, and constructing a ranking rule from the binary classifier. A weighted 0/1 loss of the binary classifier would then bound the mislabeling cost of the ranking rule. Our framework allows not only to design good ordinal regression algorithms based on well-tuned binary classification approaches, but also to derive new generalization bounds for ordinal regression from known bounds for binary classification. In addition, our framework unifies many existing ordinal regression algorithms, such as perceptron ranking and support vector ordinal regression. When compared empirically on benchmark data sets, some of our newly designed algorithms enjoy advantages in terms of both training speed and generalization performance over existing algorithms, which demonstrates the usefulness of our framework.},

 abstract = {Linear Gaussian State-Space Models are widely used and a Bayesian treatment of parameters is therefore of considerable interest. The approximate Variational Bayesian method applied to these models is an attractive approach, used successfully in applications ranging from acoustics to bioinformatics. The most challenging aspect of implementing the method is in performing inference on the hidden state sequence of the model. We show how to convert the inference problem so that standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions from the literature may be applied. This is in contrast to previously published approaches based on Belief Propagation. Our framework both simplifies and unifies the inference problem, so that future applications may be more easily developed. We demonstrate the elegance of the approach on Bayesian temporal ICA, with an application to finding independent dynamical processes underlying noisy EEG signals.},

 abstract = {In many areas of science and engineering, the problem arises how to discover low dimensional representations of high dimensional data. Recently, a number of researchers have converged on common solutions to this problem using methods from convex optimization. In particular, many results have been obtained by constructing semidefinite programs (SDPs) with low rank solutions. While the rank of matrix variables in SDPs cannot be directly constrained, it has been observed that low rank solutions emerge naturally by computing high variance or maximal trace solutions that respect local distance constraints. In this paper, we show how to solve very large problems of this type by a matrix factorization that leads to much smaller SDPs than those previously studied. The matrix factorization is derived by expanding the solution of the original problem in terms of the bottom eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian. The smaller SDPs obtained from this matrix factorization yield very good approximations to solutions of the original problem. Moreover, these approximations can be further refined by conjugate gradient descent. We illustrate the approach on localization in large scale sensor networks, where optimizations involving tens of thousands of nodes can be solved in just a few minutes.},

The method builds upon the well-known 1-norm regularization problem using a new regularizer which controls the number of learned features common for all the tasks. We show that this problem is equivalent to a convex optimization problem and develop an iterative algorithm for solving it. The algorithm has a simple interpretation: it alternately performs a supervised and an unsupervised step, where in the latter step we learn commonacross-tasks representations and in the former step we learn task-specific functions using these representations. We report experiments on a simulated and a real data set which demonstrate that the proposed method dramatically improves the performance relative to learning each task independently. Our algorithm can also be used, as a special case, to simply select – not learn – a few common features across the tasks.},

 abstract = {Blind source separation, i.e. the extraction of unknown sources from a set of given signals, is relevant for many applications. A special case of this problem is dimension reduction, where the goal is to approximate a given set of signals by superpositions of a minimal number of sources. Since in this case the signals outnumber the sources the problem is over-determined. Most popular approaches for addressing this problem are based on purely linear mixing models. However, many applications like the modeling of acoustic signals, EMG signals, or movement trajectories, require temporal shift-invariance of the extracted components. This case has only rarely been treated in the computational literature, and specifically for the case of dimension reduction almost no algorithms have been proposed. We present a new algorithm for the solution of this problem, which is based on a time-frequency transformation (Wigner-Ville distribution) of the generative model. We show that this algorithm outperforms classical source separation algorithms for linear mixtures, and also a related method for mixtures with delays. In addition, applying the new algorithm to trajectories of human gaits, we demonstrate that it is suitable for the extraction of spatio-temporal components that are easier to interpret than components extracted with other classical algorithms.},

 abstract = {Our motor system changes due to causes that span multiple timescales. For example, muscle response can change because of fatigue, a condition where the disturbance has a fast timescale or because of disease where the disturbance is much slower. Here we hypothesize that the nervous system adapts in a way that reflects the temporal properties of such potential disturbances. According to a Bayesian formulation of this idea, movement error results in a credit assignment problem: what timescale is responsible for this disturbance? The adaptation schedule influences the behavior of the optimal learner, changing estimates at different timescales as well as the uncertainty. A system that adapts in this way predicts many properties observed in saccadic gain adaptation. It well predicts the timecourses of motor adaptation in cases of partial sensory deprivation and reversals of the adaptation direction.},

In Tipping and Bishop's Bayesian image super-resolution approach [16], the marginalization was over the super-resolution image, necessitating the use of an unfavorable image prior. By integrating over the registration parameters rather than the high-resolution image, our method allows for more realistic prior distributions, and also reduces the dimension of the integral considerably, removing the main computational bottleneck of the other algorithm. In addition to the motion model used by Tipping and Bishop, illumination components are introduced into the generative model, allowing us to handle changes in lighting as well as motion.

 abstract = {We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N(100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of significance α = 1 – ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the influence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efficiently detect outliers at a given level of significance and compute their empirical p-values. We illustrate GEM for several simulated and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces.},

 abstract = {Computation of a satisfactory control policy for a Markov decision process when the parameters of the model are not exactly known is a problem encountered in many practical applications. The traditional robust approach is based on a worst-case analysis and may lead to an overly conservative policy. In this paper we consider the tradeoff between nominal performance and the worst case performance over all possible models. Based on parametric linear programming, we propose a method that computes the whole set of Pareto efficient policies in the performance-robustness plane when only the reward parameters are subject to uncertainty. In the more general case when the transition probabilities are also subject to error, we show that the strategy with the optimal tradeoff might be non-Markovian and hence is in general not tractable.},

 abstract = {Everyday inductive reasoning draws on many kinds of knowledge, including knowledge about relationships between properties and knowledge about relationships between objects. Previous accounts of inductive reasoning generally focus on just one kind of knowledge: models of causal reasoning often focus on relationships between properties, and models of similarity-based reasoning often focus on similarity relationships between objects. We present a Bayesian model of inductive reasoning that incorporates both kinds of knowledge, and show that it accounts well for human inferences about the properties of biological species.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of detecting humans and classifying their pose from a single image. Specifically, our goal is to devise a statistical model that simultaneously answers two questions: 1) is there a human in the image? and, if so, 2) what is a low-dimensional representation of her pose? We investigate models that can be learned in an unsupervised manner on unlabeled images of human poses, and provide information that can be used to match the pose of a new image to the ones present in the training set. Starting from a set of descriptors recently proposed for human detection, we apply the Latent Dirichlet Allocation framework to model the statistics of these features, and use the resulting model to answer the above questions. We show how our model can efficiently describe the space of images of humans with their pose, by providing an effective representation of poses for tasks such as classification and matching, while performing remarkably well in human/non human decision problems, thus enabling its use for human detection. We validate the model with extensive quantitative experiments and comparisons with other approaches on human detection and pose matching.},

 abstract = {We present a new statistical framework called hidden Markov Dirichlet process (HMDP) to jointly model the genetic recombinations among possibly infinite number of founders and the coalescence-with-mutation events in the resulting genealogies. The HMDP posits that a haplotype of genetic markers is generated by a sequence of recombination events that select an ancestor for each locus from an unbounded set of founders according to a 1st-order Markov transition process. Conjoining this process with a mutation model, our method accommodates both between-lineage recombination and within-lineage sequence variations, and leads to a compact and natural interpretation of the population structure and inheritance process underlying haplotype data. We have developed an efficient sampling algorithm for HMDP based on a two-level nested Polya urn scheme. On both simulated and real SNP haplotype data, our method performs competitively or significantly better than extant methods in uncovering the recombination hotspots along chromosomal loci; and in addition it also infers the ancestral genetic patterns and offers a highly accurate map of ancestral compositions of modern populations.},

 abstract = {We describe and analyze an algorithmic framework for online classification where each online trial consists of multiple prediction tasks that are tied together. We tackle the problem of updating the online hypothesis by defining a projection problem in which each prediction task corresponds to a single linear constraint. These constraints are tied together through a single slack parameter. We then introduce a general method for approximately solving the problem by projecting simultaneously and independently on each constraint which corresponds to a prediction sub-problem, and then averaging the individual solutions. We show that this approach constitutes a feasible, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution for the original projection problem. We derive concrete simultaneous projection schemes and analyze them in the mistake bound model. We demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm in experiments with online multiclass text categorization. Our experiments indicate that a combination of class-dependent features with the simultaneous projection method outperforms previously studied algorithms.},

Subspace ICA models generalize the assumption of component independence to independence between groups of components. They are attractive candidates for dimensionality reduction methods, however are currently limited by the assumption of equal group sizes or less general semi-parametric models. By introducing the concept of irreducible independent subspaces or components, we present a generalization to a parameter-free mixture model. Moreover, we relieve the condition of at-most-one-Gaussian by including previous results on non-Gaussian component analysis. After introducing this general model, we discuss joint block diagonalization with unknown block sizes, on which we base a simple extension of JADE to algorithmically perform the subspace analysis. Simulations confirm the feasibility of the algorithm.},

In this setting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a method for discovering anomalies by continuously tracking the projection of the data onto a residual subspace. This method was shown to work well empirically in highly aggregated networks, that is, those with a limited number of large nodes and at coarse time scales. This approach, however, has scalability limitations. To overcome these limitations, we develop a PCA-based anomaly detector in which adaptive local data filters send to a coordinator just enough data to enable accurate global detection. Our method is based on a stochastic matrix perturbation analysis that characterizes the tradeoff between the accuracy of anomaly detection and the amount of data communicated over the network.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of grasping novel objects, specifically objects that are being seen for the first time through vision. Grasping a previously unknown object, one for which a 3-d model is not available, is a challenging problem. Furthermore, even if given a model, one still has to decide where to grasp the object. We present a learning algorithm that neither requires nor tries to build a 3-d model of the object. Given two (or more) images of an object, our algorithm attempts to identify a few points in each image corresponding to good locations at which to grasp the object. This sparse set of points is then triangulated to obtain a 3-d location at which to attempt a grasp. This is in contrast to standard dense stereo, which tries to triangulate every single point in an image (and often fails to return a good 3-d model). Our algorithm for identifying grasp locations from an image is trained by means of supervised learning, using synthetic images for the training set. We demonstrate this approach on two robotic manipulation platforms. Our algorithm successfully grasps a wide variety of objects, such as plates, tape rolls, jugs, cellphones, keys, screwdrivers, staplers, a thick coil of wire, a strangely shaped power horn and others, none of which were seen in the training set. We also apply our method to the task of unloading items from dishwashers.},

 abstract = {Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain's search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.},

 abstract = {We present a method for binary on-line classification of triggered but temporally blurred events that are embedded in noisy time series in the context of on-line discrimination between left and right imaginary hand-movement. In particular the goal of the binary classification problem is to obtain the decision, as fast and as reliably as possible from the recorded EEG single trials. To provide a probabilistic decision at every time-point t the presented method gathers information from two distinct sequences of features across time. In order to incorporate decisions from prior time-points we suggest an appropriate weighting scheme, that emphasizes time instances, providing a higher discriminatory power between the instantaneous class distributions of each feature, where the discriminatory power is quantified in terms of the Bayes error of misclassification.

The effectiveness of this procedure is verified by its successful application in the 3rd BCI competition. Disclosure of the data after the competition revealed this approach to be superior with single trial error rates as low as 10.7, 11.5 and 16.7% for the three different subjects under study.},

 abstract = {We address the problem of blind motion deblurring from a single image, caused by a few moving objects. In such situations only part of the image may be blurred, and the scene consists of layers blurred in different degrees. Most of of existing blind deconvolution research concentrates at recovering a single blurring kernel for the entire image. However, in the case of different motions, the blur cannot be modeled with a single kernel, and trying to deconvolve the entire image with the same kernel will cause serious artifacts. Thus, the task of deblurring needs to involve segmentation of the image into regions with different blurs.

Our approach relies on the observation that the statistics of derivative filters in images are significantly changed by blur. Assuming the blur results from a constant velocity motion, we can limit the search to one dimensional box filter blurs. This enables us to model the expected derivatives distributions as a function of the width of the blur kernel. Those distributions are surprisingly powerful in discriminating regions with different blurs. The approach produces convincing deconvolution results on real world images with rich texture.},

Due to computational considerations these models are unfortunately unsuitable for large scale data-mining applications. We propose a class of deterministic accelerated DP mixture models that can routinely handle millions of data-cases. The speedup is achieved by incorporating kd-trees into a variational Bayesian algorithm for DP mixtures in the stick-breaking representation, similar to that of Blei and Jordan (2005). Our algorithm differs in the use of kd-trees and in the way we handle truncation: we only assume that the variational distributions are fixed at their priors after a certain level. Experiments show that speedups relative to the standard variational algorithm can be significant.},

 abstract = {We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefficients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The final result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird floating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefficients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.},

However, finding sparse codes remains a very difficult computational problem. In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons.},

Whereas previous matching approximation algorithms suffer from distortion factors that increase linearly with the feature dimension, we demonstrate that our approach can maintain constant accuracy even as the feature dimension increases.

Variabilities in mixing proportions across groups are handled using hierarchical Dirichlet processes, also allowing for automatic determination of the number of components. In addition, each group is allowed to have its own component parameters coming from a prior described by a template mixture model. This group-level variability in the component parameters is handled using a random effects model.

A standard challenge in solving these problems is determining the dimensionality of the latent matrices. Nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization is one way of dealing with this challenge, yielding a posterior distribution over possible factorizations of unbounded dimensionality. A drawback to this approach is that posterior estimation is typically done using Gibbs sampling, which can be slow for large problems and when conjugate priors cannot be used.

 abstract = {Semi-supervised learning is more powerful than supervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, the manifold regularization framework, together with kernel methods, leads to the Laplacian SVM (LapSVM) that has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, the LapSVM solution typically involves kernel expansions of all the labeled and unlabeled examples, and is slow on testing. Moreover, existing semi-supervised learning methods, including the LapSVM, can only handle a small number of unlabeled examples. In this paper, we integrate manifold regularization with the core vector machine, which has been used for large-scale supervised and unsupervised learning. By using a sparsified manifold regularizer and formulating as a center-constrained minimum enclosing ball problem, the proposed method produces sparse solutions with low time and space complexities. Experimental results show that it is much faster than the LapSVM, and can handle a million unlabeled examples on a standard PC; while the LapSVM can only handle several thousand patterns.},

 abstract = {Learning by imitation represents an important mechanism for rapid acquisition of new behaviors in humans and robots. A critical requirement for learning by imitation is the ability to handle uncertainty arising from the observation process as well as the imitator's own dynamics and interactions with the environment. In this paper, we present a new probabilistic method for inferring imitative actions that takes into account both the observations of the teacher as well as the imitator's dynamics. Our key contribution is a nonparametric learning method which generalizes to systems with very different dynamics. Rather than relying on a known forward model of the dynamics, our approach learns a nonparametric forward model via exploration. Leveraging advances in approximate inference in graphical models, we show how the learned forward model can be directly used to plan an imitating sequence. We provide experimental results for two systems: a biomechanical model of the human arm and a 25-degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to learn appropriate motor inputs to the model arm which imitates the desired movements. A second set of results demonstrates dynamically stable full-body imitation of a human teacher by the humanoid robot.},

 abstract = {Active learning refers to algorithmic frameworks aimed at selecting training data points in order to reduce the number of required training data points and/or improve the generalization performance of a learning method. In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis of active learning for generalized linear models. Our analysis holds under the common practical situation of model misspecification, and is based on realistic assumptions regarding the nature of the sampling distributions, which are usually neither independent nor identical. We derive unbiased estimators of generalization performance, as well as estimators of expected reduction in generalization error after adding a new training data point, that allow us to optimize its sampling distribution through a convex optimization problem. Our analysis naturally leads to an algorithm for sequential active learning which is applicable for all tasks supported by generalized linear models (e.g., binary classification, multi-class classification, regression) and can be applied in non-linear settings through the use of Mercer kernels.},

Here, we use this local description to construct a global field of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM). Specifically, we model subbands of wavelet coefficients as a product of an exponentiated homogeneous Gaussian Markov random field (hGMRF) and a second independent hGMRF. We show that parameter estimation for FoGSM is feasible, and that samples drawn from an estimated FoGSM model have marginal and joint statistics similar to wavelet coefficients of photographic images. We develop an algorithm for image denoising based on the FoGSM model, and demonstrate substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art denoising method based on the local GSM model.},

Sampling for SAT problems has been shown to have interesting connections with probabilistic reasoning, making practical sampling algorithms for SAT highly desirable. The best current approaches are based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which have some practical limitations. Our approach exploits combinatorial properties of random parity (XOR) constraints to prune away solutions near-uniformly. The final sample is identified amongst the remaining ones using a state-of-the-art SAT solver. The resulting sampling distribution is provably arbitrarily close to uniform. Our experiments show that our technique achieves a significantly better sampling quality than the best alternative.},

 abstract = {Clustering, or factoring of a document collection attempts to explain each observed document in terms of one or a small number of inferred prototypes. Prior work demonstrated that when links exist between documents in the corpus (as is the case with a collection of web pages or scientific papers), building a joint model of document contents and connections produces a better model than that built from contents or connections alone.

Many problems arise when trying to apply these joint models to corpus at the scale of the World Wide Web, however; one of these is that the sheer overhead of representing a feature space on the order of billions of dimensions becomes impractical.

We address this problem with a simple representational shift inspired by probabilistic relational models: instead of representing document linkage in terms of the identities of linking documents, we represent it by the explicit and inferred attributes of the linking documents. Several surprising results come with this shift: in addition to being computationally more tractable, the new model produces factors that more cleanly decompose the document collection. We discuss several variations on this model and show how some can be seen as exact generalizations of the PageRank algorithm.},

For example, in gene expression data, the expression level Z is a function of gene X and condition Y; or in movie ratings data the rating Z is a function of viewer X and movie Y. The approach represents a consistent extension of the Information Bottleneck method that has previously relied on the availability of co-occurrence statistics. By altering the relevance variable we eliminate the need in the sample of joint distribution of all input variables. This new formulation also enables simple MDL-like model complexity control and prediction of missing values of Z. The approach is analyzed and shown to be on a par with the best known clustering algorithms for a wide range of domains. For the prediction of missing values (collaborative filtering) it improves the currently best known results.},

The model estimates contributions to sensor data from evoked sources, interference sources and sensor noise using Bayesian methods and by exploiting knowledge about their timing and spatial covariance properties. Full posterior distributions are computed rather than just the MAP estimates. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time courses of several simultaneously active dipoles, with rotating or fixed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. The algorithm even performs reasonably at noise levels typical of an average of just a few trials. The algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm using MEG data for localizing bilateral auditory cortex, low-SNR somatosensory activations, and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated.},

However, for simplicity of simulation, most models of processing by cortical neural networks have assumed that the activations of their neurons can be approximated by event rates rather than taking account of individual spikes. The obstacle to exploring the more detailed spike processing of these networks has been reduced considerably in recent years by the development of hybrid analog-digital Very-Large Scale Integrated (hVLSI) neural networks composed of spiking neurons that are able to operate in real-time. In this paper we describe such a hVLSI neural network that performs an interesting task of selective attentional processing that was previously described for a simulated 'pointer-map' rate model by Hahnloser and colleagues. We found that most of the computational features of their rate model can be reproduced in the spiking implementation; but, that spike-based processing requires a modification of the original network architecture in order to memorize a previously attended target.},

Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 × 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 × 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are briefly discussed.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel exemplar-based approach to extract dynamic foreground regions from a changing background within a collection of images or a video sequence. By using image segmentation as a pre-processing step, we convert this traditional pixel-wise labeling problem into a lower-dimensional supervised, binary labeling procedure on image segments. Our approach consists of three steps. First, a set of random image are spatially and adaptively sampled within each segment. Second, these sets of extracted samples are formed into two bags of patches to model the foreground/background appearance, respectively. We perform a novel bidirectional consistency check between new from incoming frames and current bags of patches to reject outliers, control model rigidity and make the model adaptive to new observations. Within each bag, image are further partitioned and resampled to create an evolving appearance model. Finally, the foreground/background decision over segments in an image is formulated using an aggregation function defined on the similarity measurements of sampled relative to the foreground and background models. The essence of the algorithm is conceptually simple and can be easily implemented within a few hundred lines of Matlab code. We evaluate and validate the proposed approach by extensive real examples of the object-level image mapping and tracking within a variety of challenging environments. We also show that it is straightforward to apply our problem formulation on non-rigid object tracking with difficult surveillance videos.},

Our approach is motivated by observations from cognitive psychology, which identify parts as the defining component of basic level categories (like motorcycles), while sub-ordinate categories are more often defined by part properties (like 'jagged wheels'). Accordingly, we suggest a two-stage algorithm: First, a relational part based object model is learnt using unsegmented object images from the inclusive class (e.g., motorcycles in general). The model is then used to build a class-specific vector representation for images, where each entry corresponds to a model's part. In the second stage we train a standard discriminative classifier to classify subclass instances (e.g., cross motorcycles) based on the class-specific vector representation. We describe extensive experimental results with several subclasses. The proposed algorithm typically gives better results than a competing one-step algorithm, or a two stage algorithm where classification is based on a model of the sub-ordinate class.},

The spam filter for a user is required to perform well with respect to this distribution. Labeled messages from publicly available sources can be utilized, but they are governed by a distinct distribution, not adequately representing most inboxes. We devise a method that minimizes a loss function with respect to a user's personal distribution based on the available biased sample. A nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian model furthermore generalizes across users by learning a common prior which is imposed on new email accounts. Empirically, we observe that bias-corrected learning outperforms naive reliance on the assumption of independent and identically distributed data; Dirichlet-enhanced generalization across users outperforms a single (one size fits all) filter as well as independent filters for all users.},

Under the standard pay-per-click arrangement, revenue depends on how well the displayed advertisements appeal to users. The main difficulty stems from new advertisements whose degree of appeal has yet to be determined. Often the only reliable way of determining appeal is exploration via display to users, which detracts from exploitation of other advertisements known to have high appeal. Budget constraints and finite advertisement lifetimes make it necessary to explore as well as exploit.

In this paper we study the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, modeling advertisement placement as a multi-armed bandit problem. We extend traditional bandit formulations to account for budget constraints that occur in search engine advertising markets, and derive theoretical bounds on the performance of a family of algorithms. We measure empirical performance via extensive experiments over real-world data.},

 abstract = {Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efficient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also confirm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.},

 abstract = {Survival in a non-stationary, potentially adversarial environment requires animals to detect sensory changes rapidly yet accurately, two oft competing desiderata. Neurons subserving such detections are faced with the corresponding challenge to discern real changes in inputs as quickly as possible, while ignoring noisy fluctuations. Mathematically, this is an example of a change-detection problem that is actively researched in the controlled stochastic processes community. In this paper, we utilize sophisticated tools developed in that community to formalize an instantiation of the problem faced by the nervous system, and characterize the Bayes-optimal decision policy under certain assumptions. We will derive from this optimal strategy an information accumulation and decision process that remarkably resembles the dynamics of a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. This correspondence suggests that neurons are optimized for tracking input changes, and sheds new light on the computational import of intracellular properties such as resting membrane potential, voltage-dependent conductance, and post-spike reset voltage. We also explore the influence that factors such as timing, uncertainty, neuromodulation, and reward should and do have on neuronal dynamics and sensitivity, as the optimal decision strategy depends critically on these factors.},

 abstract = {Planning in partially observable domains is a notoriously difficult problem. However, in many real-world scenarios, planning can be simplified by decomposing the task into a hierarchy of smaller planning problems. Several approaches have been proposed to optimize a policy that decomposes according to a hierarchy specified a priori. In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically discovering the hierarchy. More precisely, we frame the optimization of a hierarchical policy as a non-convex optimization problem that can be solved with general non-linear solvers, a mixed-integer non-linear approximation or a form of bounded hierarchical policy iteration. By encoding the hierarchical structure as variables of the optimization problem, we can automatically discover a hierarchy. Our method is flexible enough to allow any parts of the hierarchy to be specified based on prior knowledge while letting the optimization discover the unknown parts. It can also discover hierarchical policies, including recursive policies, that are more compact (potentially infinitely fewer parameters) and often easier to understand given the decomposition induced by the hierarchy.},

Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with adaptors that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to define and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework.},

 abstract = {In many modern large-scale learning applications, the amount of unlabeled data far exceeds that of labeled data. A common instance of this problem is the transductive setting where the unlabeled test points are known to the learning algorithm. This paper presents a study of regression problems in that setting. It presents explicit VC-dimension error bounds for transductive regression that hold for all bounded loss functions and coincide with the tight classification bounds of Vapnik when applied to classification. It also presents a new transductive regression algorithm inspired by our bound that admits a primal and kernelized closed-form solution and deals efficiently with large amounts of unlabeled data. The algorithm exploits the position of unlabeled points to locally estimate their labels and then uses a global optimization to ensure robust predictions. Our study also includes the results of experiments with several publicly available regression data sets with up to 20,000 unlabeled examples. The comparison with other transductive regression algorithms shows that it performs well and that it can scale to large data sets.},

 abstract = {A key challenge in designing analog-to-digital converters for cortically implanted prosthesis is to sense and process high-dimensional neural signals recorded by the micro-electrode arrays. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion that combines ∑Δ conversion with spatial de-correlation within a single module. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ∑Δ is based on a min-max gradient descent optimization of a regularized linear cost function that naturally lends to an A/D formulation. Using an online formulation, the architecture can adapt to slow variations in cross-channel correlations, observed due to relative motion of the micro-electrodes with respect to the signal sources. Experimental results with real recorded multi-channel neural data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in alleviating cross-channel redundancy across electrodes and performing data-compression directly at the A/D converter.},

 abstract = {Computational gene prediction using generative models has reached a plateau, with several groups converging to a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) incorporating phylogenetic models of nucleotide sequence evolution. Further improvements in gene calling accuracy are likely to come through new methods that incorporate additional data, both comparative and species specific. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which directly model the conditional probability P(y|x) of a vector of hidden states conditioned on a set of observations, provide a unified framework for combining probabilistic and non-probabilistic information and have been shown to outperform HMMs on sequence labeling tasks in natural language processing.

We describe the use of CRFs for comparative gene prediction. We implement a model that encapsulates both a phylogenetic-GHMM (our baseline comparative model) and additional non-probabilistic features. We tested our model on the genome sequence of the fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Our baseline comparative model displays accuracy comparable to the the best available gene prediction tool for this organism. Moreover, we show that discriminative training and the incorporation of non-probabilistic evidence significantly improve performance.

Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a model-based system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task.},

In this model, we show there is a striking small world threshold phenomenon: in two dimensions, if ∝ 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network whose diameter grows as a root of the network size, and thus is unbounded. We contrast our results with those of Kleinberg [8] in a stochastic model, and empirically investigate the navigability of equilibrium networks.

 abstract = {We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) framework, stochastic relational models (SRM), for learning social, physical, and other relational phenomena where interactions between entities are observed. The key idea is to model the stochastic structure of entity relationships (i.e., links) via a tensor interaction of multiple GPs, each defined on one type of entities. These models in fact define a set of nonparametric priors on infinite dimensional tensor matrices, where each element represents a relationship between a tuple of entities. By maximizing the marginalized likelihood, information is exchanged between the participating GPs through the entire relational network, so that the dependency structure of links is messaged to the dependency of entities, reflected by the adapted GP kernels. The framework offers a discriminative approach to link prediction, namely, predicting the existences, strengths, or types of relationships based on the partially observed linkage network as well as the attributes of entities (if given). We discuss properties and variants of SRM and derive an efficient learning algorithm. Very encouraging experimental results are achieved on a toy problem and a user-movie preference link prediction task. In the end we discuss extensions of SRM to general relational learning tasks.},

 abstract = {The performance of EEG-based Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCIs) critically depends on the extraction of features from the EEG carrying information relevant for the classification of different mental states. For BCIs employing imaginary movements of different limbs, the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) has been shown to achieve excellent classification results. The CSP-algorithm however suffers from a lack of robustness, requiring training data without artifacts for good performance. To overcome this lack of robustness, we propose an adaptive spatial filter that replaces the training data in the CSP approach by a-priori information. More specifically, we design an adaptive spatial filter that maximizes the ratio of the variance of the electric field originating in a predefined region of interest (ROI) and the overall variance of the measured EEG. Since it is known that the component of the EEG used for discriminating imaginary movements originates in the motor cortex, we design two adaptive spatial filters with the ROIs centered in the hand areas of the left and right motor cortex. We then use these to classify EEG data recorded during imaginary movements of the right and left hand of three subjects, and show that the adaptive spatial filters outperform the CSP-algorithm, enabling classification rates of up to 94.7 % without artifact rejection.},

We propose an objective method for selecting the bin size of a time-histogram from the spike data, so that the time-histogram best approximates the unknown underlying rate. The resolution of the histogram increases, or the optimal bin size decreases, with the number of spike sequences sampled. It is notable that the optimal bin size diverges if only a small number of experimental trials are available from a moderately fluctuating rate process. In this case, any attempt to characterize the underlying spike rate will lead to spurious results. Given a paucity of data, our method can also suggest how many more trials are needed until the set of data can be analyzed with the required resolution.},

 abstract = {Attempting to model human categorization and similarity judgements is both a very interesting but also an exceedingly difficult challenge. Some of the difficulty arises because of conflicting evidence whether human categorization and similarity judgements should or should not be modelled as to operate on a mental representation that is essentially metric. Intuitively, this has a strong appeal as it would allow (dis)similarity to be represented geometrically as distance in some internal space. Here we show how a single stimulus, carefully constructed in a psychophysical experiment, introduces l2 violations in what used to be an internal similarity space that could be adequately modelled as Euclidean. We term this one influential data point a conflictual judgement. We present an algorithm of how to analyse such data and how to identify the crucial point. Thus there may not be a strict dichotomy between either a metric or a non-metric internal space but rather degrees to which potentially large subsets of stimuli are represented metrically with a small subset causing a global violation of metricity.},

We propose a VLSI implementation of a spiking cooperative competitive network and show how it can perform context dependent computation both in the mean firing rate domain and in spike timing correlation space. In the mean rate case the network amplifies the activity of neurons belonging to the selected stimulus and suppresses the activity of neurons receiving weaker stimuli. In the event correlation case, the recurrent network amplifies with a higher gain the correlation between neurons which receive highly correlated inputs while leaving the mean firing rate unaltered. We describe the network architecture and present experimental data demonstrating its context dependent computation capabilities.},

Based on the representer theorem, the solution consists of a linear combination of translates of a kernel. This paper investigates a generalized form of representer theorem for kernel-based learning. After mapping predefined features and translates of a kernel simultaneously onto a hypothesis space by a specific way of constructing kernels, we proposed a new algorithm by utilizing a generalized regularizer which leaves part of the space unregularized. Using a squared-loss function in calculating the empirical error, a simple convex solution is obtained which combines predefined features with translates of the kernel. Empirical evaluations have confirmed the effectiveness of the algorithm for supervised learning tasks.},

 abstract = {We are at the beginning of the multicore era. Computers will have increasingly many cores (processors), but there is still no good programming framework for these architectures, and thus no simple and unified way for machine learning to take advantage of the potential speed up. In this paper, we develop a broadly applicable parallel programming method, one that is easily applied to many different learning algorithms. Our work is in distinct contrast to the tradition in machine learning of designing (often ingenious) ways to speed up a single algorithm at a time. Specifically, we show that algorithms that fit the Statistical Query model [15] can be written in a certain summation form, which allows them to be easily parallelized on multicore computers. We adapt Google's map-reduce [7] paradigm to demonstrate this parallel speed up technique on a variety of learning algorithms including locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), k-means, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes (NB), SVM, ICA, PCA, gaussian discriminant analysis (GDA), EM, and backpropagation (NN). Our experimental results show basically linear speedup with an increasing number of processors.},

We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the traffic signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the traffic system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison.

Existing MIL algorithms are much too computationally expensive for these datasets. We describe CH, a framework for learning a Convex Hull representation of multiple instances that is significantly faster than existing MIL algorithms. Our CH framework applies to any standard hyperplane-based learning algorithm, and for some algorithms, is guaranteed to find the global optimal solution. Experimental studies on two different CAD applications further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves diagnostic accuracy when compared to both MIL and traditional classifiers. Although not designed for standard MIL problems (which have both positive and negative bags and relatively balanced datasets), comparisons against other MIL methods on benchmark problems also indicate that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {Adaptively optimizing experiments can significantly reduce the number of trials needed to characterize neural responses using parametric statistical models. However, the potential for these methods has been limited to date by severe computational challenges: choosing the stimulus which will provide the most information about the (typically high-dimensional) model parameters requires evaluating a high-dimensional integration and optimization in near-real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the optimal (most informative) stimulus based on a Fisher approximation of the Shannon information and specialized numerical linear algebra techniques. This algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a one-dimensional linesearch to choose the stimulus and is therefore efficient even for high-dimensional stimulus and parameter spaces; for example, we require just 15 milliseconds on a desktop computer to optimize a 100-dimensional stimulus. Our algorithm therefore makes real-time adaptive experimental design feasible. Simulation results show that model parameters can be estimated much more efficiently using these adaptive techniques than by using random (nonadaptive) stimuli. Finally, we generalize the algorithm to efficiently handle both fast adaptation due to spike-history effects and slow, non-systematic drifts in the model parameters.},

The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces stroke detectors when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like filters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the first layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical filter maps.},

This allows the model to learn in a data-driven fashion what factors are generating the observations on a particular day, including (for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-specific effects corresponding to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category.

However, in certain subclasses of MRF, an optimal or close-to-optimal assignment can be found very efficiently using combinatorial optimization algorithms: certain MRFs with mutual exclusion constraints can be solved using bipartite matching, and MRFs with regular potentials can be solved using minimum cut methods. However, these solutions do not apply to the many MRFs that contain such tractable components as sub-networks, but also other non-complying potentials. In this paper, we present a new method, called COMPOSE, for exploiting combinatorial optimization for sub-networks within the context of a max-product belief propagation algorithm. COMPOSE uses combinatorial optimization for computing exact max-marginals for an entire sub-network; these can then be used for inference in the context of the network as a whole. We describe highly efficient methods for computing max-marginals for subnetworks corresponding both to bipartite matchings and to regular networks. We present results on both synthetic and real networks encoding correspondence problems between images, which involve both matching constraints and pairwise geometric constraints. We compare to a range of current methods, showing that the ability of COMPOSE to transmit information globally across the network leads to improved convergence, decreased running time, and higher-scoring assignments.},

However, in many real-life settings, each input object is best described by multiple samples drawn from a multivariate Gaussian. Such data can arise, for example, in a movie review database where each movie is rated by several users, or in time-series domains such as sensor networks. Here, each input can be naturally described by both a mean vector and covariance matrix which parameterize the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering such input objects, each represented as a multivariate Gaussian. We formulate the problem using an information theoretic approach and draw several interesting theoretical connections to Bregman divergences and also Bregman matrix divergences. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic data, sensor network data, and a statistical debugging application.},

 abstract = {A reliable motion estimation algorithm must function under a wide range of conditions. One regime, which we consider here, is the case of moving objects with contours but no visible texture. Tracking distinctive features such as corners can disambiguate the motion of contours, but spurious features such as T-junctions can be badly misleading. It is difficult to determine the reliability of motion from local measurements, since a full rank covariance matrix can result from both real and spurious features. We propose a novel approach that avoids these points altogether, and derives global motion estimates by utilizing information from three levels of contour analysis: edgelets, boundary fragments and contours. Boundary fragment are chains of orientated edgelets, for which we derive motion estimates from local evidence. The uncertainties of the local estimates are disambiguated after the boundary fragments are properly grouped into contours. The grouping is done by constructing a graphical model and marginalizing it using importance sampling. We propose two equivalent representations in this graphical model, reversible switch variables attached to the ends of fragments and fragment chains, to capture both local and global statistics of boundaries. Our system is successfully applied to both synthetic and real video sequences containing high-contrast boundaries and textureless regions. The system produces good motion estimates along with properly grouped and completed contours.},

 abstract = {Bayesian estimators are defined in terms of the posterior distribution. Typically, this is written as the product of the likelihood function and a prior probability density, both of which are assumed to be known. But in many situations, the prior density is not known, and is difficult to learn from data since one does not have access to uncorrupted samples of the variable being estimated. We show that for a wide variety of observation models, the Bayes least squares (BLS) estimator may be formulated without explicit reference to the prior. Specifically, we derive a direct expression for the estimator, and a related expression for the mean squared estimation error, both in terms of the density of the observed measurements. Each of these prior-free formulations allows us to approximate the estimator given a sufficient amount of observed data. We use the first form to develop practical nonparametric approximations of BLS estimators for several different observation processes, and the second form to develop a parametric family of estimators for use in the additive Gaussian noise case. We examine the empirical performance of these estimators as a function of the amount of observed data.},

 abstract = {Many recent studies analyze how data from different modalities can be combined. Often this is modeled as a system that optimally combines several sources of information about the same variable. However, it has long been realized that this information combining depends on the interpretation of the data. Two cues that are perceived by different modalities can have different causal relationships: (1) They can both have the same cause, in this case we should fully integrate both cues into a joint estimate. (2) They can have distinct causes, in which case information should be processed independently. In many cases we will not know if there is one joint cause or two independent causes that are responsible for the cues. Here we model this situation as a Bayesian estimation problem. We are thus able to explain some experiments on visual auditory cue combination as well as some experiments on visual proprioceptive cue integration. Our analysis shows that the problem solved by people when they combine cues to produce a movement is much more complicated than is usually assumed, because they need to infer the causal structure that is underlying their sensory experience.},

Many recent approximate methods for graphs with cycles are based on tractable algorithms for tree structured graphs. Here we base the approximation on a different tractable model, planar graphs with binary variables and pure interaction potentials (no external field). The partition function for such models can be calculated exactly using an algorithm introduced by Fisher and Kasteleyn in the 1960s. We show how such tractable planar models can be used in a decomposition to derive upper bounds on the partition function of non-planar models. The resulting algorithm also allows for the estimation of marginals. We compare our planar decomposition to the tree decomposition method of Wain-wright et. al., showing that it results in a much tighter bound on the partition function, improved pairwise marginals, and comparable singleton marginals.},

 abstract = {Categorization is a central activity of human cognition. When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item influences category decisions for subsequent items. Specifically, when experimental subjects are shown an exemplar of some target category, the category prototype appears to be pulled toward the exemplar, and the prototypes of all nontarget categories appear to be pushed away. These push and pull effects diminish with experience, and likely reflect long-term learning of category boundaries. We propose and evaluate four principled probabilistic (Bayesian) accounts of context effects in categorization. In all four accounts, the probability of an exemplar given a category is encoded as a Gaussian density in feature space, and categorization involves computing category posteriors given an exemplar. The models differ in how the uncertainty distribution of category prototypes is represented (localist or distributed), and how it is updated following each experience (using a maximum likelihood gradient ascent, or a Kalman filter update). We find that the distributed maximum-likelihood model can explain the key experimental phenomena. Further, the model predicts other phenomena that were confirmed via reanalysis of the experimental data.},

The VB approach, while useful, can nevertheless suffer from slow convergence to the approximate solution. To address this problem, we propose Parameter-eXpanded Variational Bayesian (PX-VB) methods to speed up VB. The new algorithm is inspired by parameter-expanded expectation maximization (PX-EM) and parameter-expanded data augmentation (PX-DA). Similar to PX-EM and -DA, PX-VB expands a model with auxiliary variables to reduce the coupling between variables in the original model.

 abstract = {We rigorously establish a close relationship between message passing algorithms and models of neurodynamics by showing that the equations of a continuous Hop-field network can be derived from the equations of belief propagation on a binary Markov random field. As Hopfield networks are equipped with a Lyapunov function, convergenceis guaranteed. As a consequence, in the limit of many weak connections per neuron, Hopfield networks exactly implement a continuous-time variant of belief propagation starting from message initialisations that prevent from running into convergence problems. Our results lead to a better understanding of the role of message passing algorithms in real biological neural networks.},

 abstract = {We describe an unsupervised method for learning a probabilistic grammar of an object from a set of training examples. Our approach is invariant to the scale and rotation of the objects. We illustrate our approach using thirteen objects from the Caltech 101 database. In addition, we learn the model of a hybrid object class where we do not know the specific object or its position, scale or pose. This is illustrated by learning a hybrid class consisting of faces, motorbikes, and airplanes. The individual objects can be recovered as different aspects of the grammar for the object class. In all cases, we validate our results by learning the probability grammars from training datasets and evaluating them on the test datasets. We compare our method to alternative approaches. The advantages of our approach is the speed of inference (under one second), the parsing of the object, and increased accuracy of performance. Moreover, our approach is very general and can be applied to a large range of objects and structures.},

 abstract = {This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general.},

 abstract = {Starting with the work of Jaakkola and Haussler, a variety of approaches have been proposed for coupling domain-specific generative models with statistical learning methods. The link is established by a kernel function which provides a similarity measure based inherently on the underlying model. In computational biology, the full promise of this framework has rarely ever been exploited, as most kernels are derived from very generic models, such as sequence profiles or hidden Markov models. Here, we introduce the MTreeMix kernel, which is based on a generative model tailored to the underlying biological mechanism. Specifically, the kernel quantifies the similarity of evolutionary escape from antiviral drug pressure between two viral sequence samples. We compare this novel kernel to a standard, evolution-agnostic amino acid encoding in the prediction of HIV drug resistance from genotype, using support vector regression. The results show significant improvements in predictive performance across 17 anti-HIV drugs. Thus, in our study, the generative-discriminative paradigm is key to bridging the gap between population genetic modeling and clinical decision making.},

 abstract = {Under the prediction model of learning, a prediction strategy is presented with an i.i.d. sample of n – 1 points in Χ and corresponding labels from a concept ƒ ∈ Ƒ, and aims to minimize the worst-case probability of erring on an nth point. By exploiting the structure of Ƒ, Haussler et al. achieved a VC(Ƒ)/n bound for the natural one-inclusion prediction strategy, improving on bounds implied by PAC-type results by a O(log n) factor. The key data structure in their result is the natural subgraph of the hypercube—the one-inclusion graph; the key step is a d = VC(Ƒ) bound on one-inclusion graph density. The first main result of this paper is a density bound of n (≤n-1d-1) / (≤nd) < d, which positively resolves a conjecture of Kuzmin & Warmuth relating to their unlabeled Peeling compression scheme and also leads to an improved mistake bound for the randomized (deterministic) one-inclusion strategy for all d (for d ≈ Θ(n)). The proof uses a new form of VC-invariant shifting and a group-theoretic symmetrization. Our second main result is a k-class analogue of the d/n mistake bound, replacing the VC-dimension by the Pollard pseudo-dimension and the one-inclusion strategy by its natural hypergraph generalization. This bound on expected risk improves on known PAC-based results by a factor of O (log n) and is shown to be optimal up to a O(log k) factor. The combinatorial technique of shifting takes a central role in understanding the one-inclusion (hyper)graph and is a running theme throughout.},

This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art.

 abstract = {This paper addresses the bottom-up influence of local image information on human eye movements. Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear filters, e.g., Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians filters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end filters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justified. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the field that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble findings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive fields in the early human visual system.},

We show that smooth boosting algorithms such as MadaBoost can efficiently learn decision lists of length k over n boolean variables using poly(k, log n) many examples provided that the marginal distribution over the relevant variables is not too concentrated in an L2-norm sense. Using a recent result of Hastad, we extend the analysis to obtain a similar (though quantitatively weaker) result for learning arbitrary linear threshold functions with k nonzero coefficients. Experimental results indicate that the use of a smooth boosting algorithm, which plays a crucial role in our analysis, has an impact on the actual performance of the algorithm.},

 abstract = {In supervised learning there is a typical presumption that the training and test points are taken from the same distribution. In practice this assumption is commonly violated. The situations where the training and test data are from different distributions is called covariate shift. Recent work has examined techniques for dealing with covariate shift in terms of minimisation of generalisation error. As yet the literature lacks a Bayesian generative perspective on this problem. This paper tackles this issue for regression models. Recent work on covariate shift can be understood in terms of mixture regression. Using this view, we obtain a general approach to regression under covariate shift, which reproduces previous work as a special case. The main advantages of this new formulation over previous models for covariate shift are that we no longer need to presume the test and training densities are known, the regression and density estimation are combined into a single procedure, and previous methods are reproduced as special cases of this procedure, shedding light on the implicit assumptions the methods are making.},

 abstract = {In real-world planning problems, we must reason not only about our own goals, but about the goals of other agents with which we may interact. Often these agents' goals are neither completely aligned with our own nor directly opposed to them. Instead there are opportunities for cooperation: by joining forces, the agents can all achieve higher utility than they could separately. But, in order to cooperate, the agents must negotiate a mutually acceptable plan from among the many possible ones, and each agent must trust that the others will follow their parts of the deal. Research in multi-agent planning has often avoided the problem of making sure that all agents have an incentive to follow a proposed joint plan. On the other hand, while game theoretic algorithms handle incentives correctly, they often don't scale to large planning problems. In this paper we attempt to bridge the gap between these two lines of research: we present an efficient game-theoretic approximate planning algorithm, along with a negotiation protocol which encourages agents to compute and agree on joint plans that are fair and optimal in a sense defined below. We demonstrate our algorithm and protocol on two simple robotic planning problems.},

Thus, the derivatives of the cost with respect to the model parameters are either zero, or are undefined. In this paper, we propose a class of simple, flexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difficulties by working with implicit cost functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the resulting implicit cost function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate significantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for significantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions.},

In many situations, though, we have labeled training data for a source domain, and we wish to learn a classifier which performs well on a target domain with a different distribution. Under what conditions can we adapt a classifier trained on the source domain for use in the target domain? Intuitively, a good feature representation is a crucial factor in the success of domain adaptation. We formalize this intuition theoretically with a generalization bound for domain adaption. Our theory illustrates the tradeoffs inherent in designing a representation for domain adaptation and gives a new justification for a recently proposed model. It also points toward a promising new model for domain adaptation: one which explicitly minimizes the difference between the source and target domains, while at the same time maximizing the margin of the training set.},

Computational models on stereopsis suggest local competition and long-range cooperation are important for resolving ambiguity during stereo matching. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded from multiple neurons in V1 of awake, behaving macaques while presenting surfaces of different depths rendered in dynamic random dot stereograms. We found that the interaction between pairs of neurons was a function of similarity in receptive fields, as well as of the input stimulus. Neurons coding the same depth experienced common inhibition early in their responses for stimuli presented at their non-preferred disparities. They experienced mutual facilitation later in their responses for stimulation at their preferred disparity. These findings are consistent with a local competition mechanism that first removes gross mismatches, and a global cooperative mechanism that further refines depth estimates.},

 abstract = {Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization.

In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off fidelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational benefits of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated.},

In reinforcement learning (RL) models, meta-parameters such as learning rate, future reward discount factor, and exploitation-exploration factor, control learning dynamics and performance. They are hypothesized to be related to neuromodulatory levels in the brain. We found that many aspects of animal learning and performance can be described by simple RL models using dynamic control of the meta-parameters. To study the effects of stress and genotype, we carried out 5-hole-box light conditioning and Morris water maze experiments with C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains. The animals were exposed to different kinds of stress to evaluate its effects on immediate performance as well as on long-term memory. Then, we used RL models to simulate their behavior. For each experimental session, we estimated a set of model meta-parameters that produced the best fit between the model and the animal performance. The dynamics of several estimated meta-parameters were qualitatively similar for the two simulated experiments, and with statistically significant differences between different genetic strains and stress conditions.},

 abstract = {We introduce a method for approximate smoothed inference in a class of switching linear dynamical systems, based on a novel form of Gaussian Sum smoother. This class includes the switching Kalman Filter and the more general case of switch transitions dependent on the continuous latent state. The method improves on the standard Kim smoothing approach by dispensing with one of the key approximations, thus making fuller use of the available future information. Whilst the only central assumption required is projection to a mixture of Gaussians, we show that an additional conditional independence assumption results in a simpler but stable and accurate alternative. Unlike the alternative unstable Expectation Propagation procedure, our method consists only of a single forward and backward pass and is reminiscent of the standard smoothing 'correction' recursions in the simpler linear dynamical system. The algorithm performs well on both toy experiments and in a large scale application to noise robust speech recognition.},

 abstract = {The extraction of statistically independent components from high-dimensional multi-sensory input streams is assumed to be an essential component of sensory processing in the brain. Such independent component analysis (or blind source separation) could provide a less redundant representation of information about the external world. Another powerful processing strategy is to extract preferentially those components from high-dimensional input streams that are related to other information sources, such as internal predictions or proprioceptive feedback. This strategy allows the optimization of internal representation according to the information bottleneck method. However, concrete learning rules that implement these general unsupervised learning principles for spiking neurons are still missing. We show how both information bottleneck optimization and the extraction of independent components can in principle be implemented with stochastically spiking neurons with refractoriness. The new learning rule that achieves this is derived from abstract information optimization principles.},

 abstract = {Efficient coding models predict that the optimal code for natural images is a population of oriented Gabor receptive fields. These results match response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex, but not those in the retina. Does the retina use an optimal code, and if so, what is it optimized for? Previous theories of retinal coding have assumed that the goal is to encode the maximal amount of information about the sensory signal. However, the image sampled by retinal photoreceptors is degraded both by the optics of the eye and by the photoreceptor noise. Therefore, de-blurring and de-noising of the retinal signal should be important aspects of retinal coding. Furthermore, the ideal retinal code should be robust to neural noise and make optimal use of all available neurons. Here we present a theoretical framework to derive codes that simultaneously satisfy all of these desiderata. When optimized for natural images, the model yields filters that show strong similarities to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) receptive fields. Importantly, the characteristics of receptive fields vary with retinal eccentricities where the optical blur and the number of RGCs are significantly different. The proposed model provides a unified account of retinal coding, and more generally, it may be viewed as an extension of the Wiener filter with an arbitrary number of noisy units.},

First we connect this to zero-sum games, proving a counter-intuitive generalization of the classic min-max theorem to zero-sum games with the addition of strategy costs. We then show that potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. Both zero-sum and potential games with strategy costs maintain a very appealing property: simple learning dynamics converge to equilibrium.},

 abstract = {Spectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. Spectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. One contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. We show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the first few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. Based on these findings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. Our measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. We present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. In contrast, using this coherence measure finds the expected clusters at all scales.},

 abstract = {Maximum margin was proposed lately and has shown promising performance in recent studies [1, 2]. It extends the theory of support vector machine to unsupervised learning. Despite its good performance, there are three major problems with maximum margin that question its efficiency for real-world applications. First, it is computationally expensive and difficult to scale to large-scale datasets because the number of parameters in maximum margin is quadratic in the number of examples. Second, it requires data preprocessing to ensure that any boundary will pass through the origins, which makes it unsuitable for unbalanced dataset. Third, it is sensitive to the choice of kernel functions, and requires external procedure to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose maximum margin clustering framework that addresses the above three problems simultaneously. The new framework generalizes the maximum margin algorithm by allowing any boundaries including those not passing through the origins. It significantly improves the computational efficiency by reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the new framework is able to automatically determine the appropriate kernel matrix without any labeled data. Finally, we show a formal connection between maximum margin and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the efficiency of the generalized maximum margin algorithm using both synthetic datasets and real datasets from the UCI repository.},

The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as finite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random field priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efficient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes.},

This problem is motivated by network inference problems arising in computational biology and communication systems, in which it is difficult or impossible to obtain precise time ordering information. Without order information, every permutation of the activated nodes leads to a different feasible solution, resulting in combinatorial explosion of the feasible set. However, physical principles underlying most networked systems suggest that not all feasible solutions are equally likely. Intuitively, nodes that co-occur more frequently are probably more closely connected. Building on this intuition, we model path co-occurrences as randomly shuffled samples of a random walk on the network. We derive a computationally efficient network inference algorithm and, via novel concentration inequalities for importance sampling estimators, prove that a polynomial complexity Monte Carlo version of the algorithm converges with high probability.},

 abstract = {Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, population behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the firing phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only fire once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each neuron represents by its firing phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it fires. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system.},

In particular, information-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may include maximizing the uniformity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic reduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements.

 abstract = {Structural equation models can be seen as an extension of Gaussian belief networks to cyclic graphs, and we show they can be understood generatively as the model for the joint distribution of long term average equilibrium activity of Gaussian dynamic belief networks. Most use of structural equation models in fMRI involves postulating a particular structure and comparing learnt parameters across different groups. In this paper it is argued that there are situations where priors about structure are not firm or exhaustive, and given sufficient data, it is worth investigating learning network structure as part of the approach to connectivity analysis. First we demonstrate structure learning on a toy problem. We then show that for particular fMRI data the simple models usually assumed are not supported. We show that is is possible to learn sensible structural equation models that can provide modelling benefits, but that are not necessarily going to be the same as a true causal model, and suggest the combination of prior models and learning or the use of temporal information from dynamic models may provide more benefits than learning structural equations alone.},

 abstract = {The finite mixture model is widely used in various statistical learning problems. However, the model obtained may contain a large number of components, making it inefficient in practical applications. In this paper, we propose to simplify the mixture model by minimizing an upper bound of the approximation error between the original and the simplified model, under the use of the L (2) distance measure. This is achieved by first grouping similar components together and then performing local fitting through function approximation. The simplified model obtained can then be used as a replacement of the original model to speed up various algorithms involving mixture models during training (e.g., Bayesian filtering, belief propagation) and testing [e.g., kernel density estimation, support vector machine (SVM) testing]. Encouraging results are observed in the experiments on density estimation, clustering-based image segmentation, and simplification of SVM decision functions.},

 abstract = {In this paper, application of sparse representation (factorization) of signals over an overcomplete basis (dictionary) for signal classification is discussed. Searching for the sparse representation of a signal over an overcomplete dictionary is achieved by optimizing an objective function that includes two terms: one that measures the signal reconstruction error and another that measures the sparsity. This objective function works well in applications where signals need to be reconstructed, like coding and denoising. On the other hand, discriminative methods, such as linear discriminative analysis (LDA), are better suited for classification tasks. However, discriminative methods are usually sensitive to corruption in signals due to lacking crucial properties for signal reconstruction. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for signal classification with sparse representation. The approach combines the discrimination power of the discriminative methods with the reconstruction property and the sparsity of the sparse representation that enables one to deal with signal corruptions: noise, missing data and outliers. The proposed approach is therefore capable of robust classification with a sparse representation of signals. The theoretical results are demonstrated with signal classification tasks, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the standard discriminative methods and the standard sparse representation in the case of corrupted signals.},

 abstract = {We propose a new approach for measuring similarity between two signals, which is applicable to many machine learning tasks, and to many signal types. We say that a signal S1 is to a signal S2 if it is easy to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2. Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2. This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2. Similarity by Composition can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between different portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classification, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples.},

 abstract = {Chemical reaction networks by which individual cells gather and process information about their chemical environments have been dubbed networks. Despite this suggestive terminology, there have been few attempts to analyze chemical signaling systems with the quantitative tools of information theory. Gradient sensing in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a well characterized signal transduction system in which a cell estimates the direction of a source of diffusing chemoattractant molecules based on the spatiotemporal sequence of ligand-receptor binding events at the cell membrane. Using Monte Carlo techniques (MCell) we construct a simulation in which a collection of individual ligand particles undergoing Brownian diffusion in a three-dimensional volume interact with receptors on the surface of a static amoeboid cell. Adapting a method for estimation of spike train entropies described by Victor (originally due to Kozachenko and Leonenko), we estimate lower bounds on the mutual information between the transmitted signal (direction of ligand source) and the received signal (spatiotemporal pattern of receptor binding/unbinding events). Hence we provide a quantitative framework for addressing the question: how much could the cell know, and when could it know it? We show that the time course of the mutual information between the cell's surface receptors and the (unknown) gradient direction is consistent with experimentally measured cellular response times. We find that the acquisition of directional information depends strongly on the time constant at which the intracellular response is filtered.},

Graph learning is framed as an instance of prediction on a finite set. To treat label noise we show that the hinge loss bounds derived by Gentile [1] for online perceptron learning can be transformed to relative mistake bounds with an optimal leading constant when applied to prediction on a finite set. These bounds depend crucially on the norm of the learned concept. Often the norm of a concept can vary dramatically with only small perturbations in a labeling. We analyze a simple transformation that stabilizes the norm under perturbations. We derive an upper bound that depends only on natural properties of the graph – the graph diameter and the cut size of a partitioning of the graph – which are only indirectly dependent on the size of the graph. The impossibility of such bounds for the graph geodesic nearest neighbors algorithm will be demonstrated.},

Secure MultiParty computations use cryptographic tools to solve this problem without leaking any information. Unfortunately, these methods are slow to compute and we introduce a couple of machine learning techniques that allow the parties to solve the problem while leaking a controlled amount of information. The first method is an information-bottleneck variant of AdaBoost that lets Bob find a subset of features that are enough for classifying an image patch, but not enough to actually reconstruct it. The second machine learning technique is active learning that allows Alice to construct an online classifier, based on a small number of calls to Bob's face detector. She can then use her online classifier as a fast rejector before using a cryptographically secure classifier on the remaining image patches.},

 abstract = {Patch-based appearance models are used in a wide range of computer vision applications. To learn such models it has previously been necessary to specify a suitable set of patch sizes and shapes by hand. In the jigsaw model presented here, the shape, size and appearance of patches are learned automatically from the repeated structures in a set of training images. By learning such irregularly shaped 'jigsaw pieces', we are able to discover both the shape and the appearance of object parts without supervision. When applied to face images, for example, the learned jigsaw pieces are surprisingly strongly associated with face parts of different shapes and scales such as eyes, noses, eyebrows and cheeks, to name a few. We conclude that learning the shape of the patch not only improves the accuracy of appearance-based part detection but also allows for shape-based part detection. This enables parts of similar appearance but different shapes to be distinguished; for example, while foreheads and cheeks are both skin colored, they have markedly different shapes.},

 abstract = {Metric learning has been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classification. In problems involving thousands of features, distance learning algorithms cannot be used due to overfitting and high computational complexity. In such cases, previous work has relied on a two-step solution: first apply dimensionality reduction methods to the data, and then learn a metric in the resulting low-dimensional subspace. In this paper we show that better classification performance can be achieved by unifying the objectives of dimensionality reduction and metric learning. We propose a method that solves for the low-dimensional projection of the inputs, which minimizes a metric objective aimed at separating points in different classes by a large margin. This projection is defined by a significantly smaller number of parameters than metrics learned in input space, and thus our optimization reduces the risks of overfitting. Theory and results are presented for both a linear as well as a kernelized version of the algorithm. Overall, we achieve classification rates similar, and in several cases superior, to those of support vector machines.},

We use this hierarchy of histograms to define elementary kernels which can detect coarse and fine similarities between the objects. We compute through an efficient averaging trick a mixture of such specific kernels, to propose a final kernel value which weights efficiently local and global matches.

In many real-world problems, however, relationships among the objects of our interest are more complex than pair-wise. Naively squeezing the complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be expected valuable for our learning tasks however. Therefore we consider using hypergraphs instead to completely represent complex relationships among the objects of our interest, and thus the problem of learning with hypergraphs arises. Our main contribution in this paper is to generalize the powerful methodology of spectral clustering which originally operates on undirected graphs to hypergraphs, and further develop algorithms for hypergraph embedding and transductive classification on the basis of the spectral hypergraph clustering approach. Our experiments on a number of benchmarks showed the advantages of hypergraphs over usual graphs.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of learning classifiers for structurally incomplete data, where some objects have a subset of features inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. The common approach for handling missing features is to begin with a preprocessing phase that completes the missing features, and then use a standard classification procedure. In this paper we show how incomplete data can be classified directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate this task using a geometrically-inspired objective function, and discuss two optimization approaches: The linearly separable case is written as a set of convex feasibility problems, and the non-separable case has a non-convex objective that we optimize iteratively. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, these approaches offer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that by elegantly handling complex patterns of missing values, our approach is both competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random and outperforms them when the missing values have non-trivial structure. We demonstrate our results on two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images.},

These types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an abstraction from the words in a document to a lower-dimensional latent variable representation that captures what the document is generally about beyond the specific words it contains. In this paper we propose a new probabilistic model that tempers this approach by representing each document as a combination of (a) a background distribution over common words, (b) a mixture distribution over general topics, and (c) a distribution over words that are treated as being specific to that document. We illustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval by matching documents both at a general topic level and at a specific word level, providing an advantage over techniques that only match documents at a general level (such as topic models or latent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the specific word level (such as TF-IDF).},

 abstract = {Neural motor prostheses (NMPs) require the accurate decoding of motor cortical population activity for the control of an artificial motor system. Previous work on cortical decoding for NMPs has focused on the recovery of hand kinematics. Human NMPs however may require the control of computer cursors or robotic devices with very different physical and dynamical properties. Here we show that the firing rates of cells in the primary motor cortex of non-human primates can be used to control the parameters of an artificial physical system exhibiting realistic dynamics. The model represents 2D hand motion in terms of a point mass connected to a system of idealized springs. The nonlinear spring coefficients are estimated from the firing rates of neurons in the motor cortex. We evaluate linear and a nonlinear decoding algorithms using neural recordings from two monkeys performing two different tasks. We found that the decoded spring coefficients produced accurate hand trajectories compared with state-of-the-art methods for direct decoding of hand kinematics. Furthermore, using a physically-based system produced decoded movements that were more in that their frequency spectrum more closely matched that of natural hand movements.},

Mean field approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-specified variational approximations based on mean field theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean field. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable configurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be significantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods.},

Our approximation algorithms for optimizing this cost functional are fast and give diagnostic bounds on the quality of their solution. Our method can be viewed as a manifold learning algorithm that utilizes a prior on the low-dimensional manifold coordinates. The benefits of taking advantage of such priors in manifold learning and searching for the inverse observation functions in system identification are demonstrated empirically by learning to track moving targets from raw measurements in a sensor network setting and in an RFID tracking experiment.},

As in support vector machines, we propose a learning algorithm based on the goal of margin maximization. Unlike earlier work on max-margin Markov networks, our approach is specifically geared to the modeling of real-valued observations (such as acoustic feature vectors) using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous discriminative frameworks for ASR, such as maximum mutual information and minimum classification error, our framework leads to a convex optimization, without any spurious local minima. The objective function for large margin training of CD-HMMs is defined over a parameter space of positive semidefinite matrices. Its optimization can be performed efficiently with simple gradient-based methods that scale well to large problems. We obtain competitive results for phonetic recognition on the TIMIT speech corpus.},

 abstract = {Online convex programming has recently emerged as a powerful primitive for designing machine learning algorithms. For example, OCP can be used for learning a linear classifier, dynamically rebalancing a binary search tree, finding the shortest path in a graph with unknown edge lengths, solving a structured classification problem, or finding a good strategy in an extensive-form game. Several researchers have designed no-regret algorithms for OCP. But, compared to algorithms for special cases of OCP such as learning from expert advice, these algorithms are not very numerous or flexible. In learning from expert advice, one tool which has proved particularly valuable is the correspondence between no-regret algorithms and convex potential functions: by reasoning about these potential functions, researchers have designed algorithms with a wide variety of useful guarantees such as good performance when the target hypothesis is sparse. Until now, there has been no such recipe for the more general OCP problem, and therefore no ability to tune OCP algorithms to take advantage of properties of the problem or data. In this paper we derive a new class of no-regret learning algorithms for OCP. These Lagrangian Hedging algorithms are based on a general class of potential functions, and are a direct generalization of known learning rules like weighted majority and external-regret matching. In addition to proving regret bounds, we demonstrate our algorithms learning to play one-card poker.},

 abstract = {We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density filtering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a significant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors.},

While some of them are relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates and mRNA abundance levels, it is still very hard to measure the active concentration levels of the transcription factor proteins that drive the process and the sensitivity of target genes to these concentrations. In this paper we show how these quantities for a given transcription factor can be inferred from gene expression levels of a set of known target genes. We treat the protein concentration as a latent function with a Gaussian process prior, and include the sensitivities, mRNA decay rates and baseline expression levels as hyperparameters. We apply this procedure to a human leukemia dataset, focusing on the tumour repressor p53 and obtaining results in good accordance with recent biological studies.},

We prove bounds on the sample complexity of PAC learning in terms of the doubling dimension of this metric. These bounds imply known bounds on the sample complexity of learning halfspaces with respect to the uniform distribution that are optimal up to a constant factor. We prove a bound that holds for any algorithm that outputs a classifier with zero error whenever this is possible; this bound is in terms of the maximum of the doubling dimension and the VC-dimension of F, and strengthens the best known bound in terms of the VC-dimension alone.

 abstract = {We show that the relevant information about a classification problem in feature space is contained up to negligible error in a finite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem. Thus, kernels not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved even by linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economic use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efficient implicit representations of the data to perform classification. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the subspace and dimensionality relevant for good classification. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to help in model selection, and to (3) de-noise in feature space in order to yield better classification results.},

@inproceedings{NIPS2006_ffbd6cbb,
 abstract = {Correlation between instances is often modelled via a kernel function using input attributes of the instances. Relational knowledge can further reveal additional pairwise correlations between variables of interest. In this paper, we develop a class of models which incorporates both reciprocal relational information and input attributes using Gaussian process techniques. This approach provides a novel non-parametric Bayesian framework with a data-dependent covariance function for supervised learning tasks. We also apply this framework to semi-supervised learning. Experimental results on several real world data sets verify the usefulness of this algorithm.},
