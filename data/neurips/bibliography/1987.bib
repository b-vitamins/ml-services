Switching theory would suggest no relation at all, since all Boolean functions can be implemented using a circuit with very low connectivity (e.g., using two-input NAND gates). However, for a network that learns a problem from examples using a local learning rule, we prove that the entropy of the problem becomes a lower bound for the connectivity of the network.},

 abstract = {There is presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic reasoning by manipulating neural incodings of symbols. Less work has been performed on using neural networks to process floating point numbers and it is sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccurate and therefore best suited for fuzzy qualitative reasoning. Nevertheless, the potential speed of massively parallel operations make neural net number crunching an interesting topic to explore. In this paper we discuss some of our work in which we demonstrate that for certain applications neural networks can achieve significantly higher numerical accuracy than more conventional techniques. In particular, prediction of future values of a chaotic time series can be performed with exceptionally high accuracy. We analyze how a neural net is able to do this, and in the process show that a large class of functions from Rn → Rm may be accurately approximated by a backpropagation neural net with just two hidden layers. The network uses this functional approximation to perform either interpolation (signal processing applications) or extrapolation (symbol processing applications). Neural nets therefore use quite familiar methods to perform their tasks. The geometrical viewpoint advocated here seems to be a useful approach to analyzing neural network operation and relates neural networks to well studied topics in functional approximation.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explore the spatial organization of neural networks under Markovian assumptions, in what concerns the behaviour of individual cells and the interconnection mechanism. Space-organizational properties of neural nets are very relevant in image modeling and pattern analysis, where spatial computations on stochastic two-dimensional image fields are involved. As a first approach we develop a random neural network model, based upon simple probabilistic assumptions, whose organization is studied by means of discrete-event simulation. We then investigate the possibility of approximating the random network's behaviour by using an analytical approach originating from the theory of general product-form queueing networks. The neural network is described by an open network of nodes, in which customers moving from node to node represent stimulations and connections between nodes are expressed in terms of suitably selected routing probabilities. We obtain the solution of the model under different disciplines affecting the time spent by a stimulation at each node visited. Results concerning the distribution of excitation in the network as a function of network topology and external stimulation arrival pattern are compared with measures obtained from the simulation and validate the approach followed.},

 abstract = {This research investigates a new technique for unsupervised learning of nonlinear control problems. The approach is applied both to Michie and Chambers BOXES algorithm and to Barto, Sutton and Anderson's extension, the ASE/ACE system, and has significantly improved the convergence rate of stochastically based learning automata.

Recurrence learning is a new nonlinear reward-penalty algorithm. It exploits information found during learning trials to reinforce decisions resulting in the recurrence of nonfailing states. Recurrence learning applies positive reinforcement during the exploration of the search space, whereas in the BOXES or ASE algorithms, only negative weight reinforcement is applied, and then only on failure. Simulation results show that the added information from recurrence learning increases the learning rate.

Our empirical results show that recurrence learning is faster than both basic failure driven learning and failure prediction methods. Although recurrence learning has only been tested in failure driven experiments, there are goal directed learning applications where detection of recurring oscillations may provide useful information that reduces the learning time by applying negative, instead of positive reinforcement.

Detection of cycles provides a heuristic to improve the balance between evidence gathering and goal directed search.},

The SIMD model of parallel computation is chosen, because systems of this type can be built with large numbers of processing elements. However, such systems are not naturally suited to generalized communication. A method is proposed that allows an implementation of neural network connections on massively parallel SIMD architectures. The key to this system is an algorithm that allows the formation of arbitrary connections between the neurons. A feature is the ability to add new connections quickly. It also has error recovery ability and is robust over a variety of network topologies. Simulations of the general connection system, and its implementation on the Connection Machine, indicate that the time and space requirements are proportional to the product of the average number of connections per neuron and the diameter of the interconnection network.},

A comparison is made to optimization using gradient-search methods. The performance measure is the settling time from an initial state to a target state. A simple analytical example illustrates a situation where dynamical systems representing artificial neural network methods would settle faster than those representing gradient-search. Settling time was investigated for a more complicated optimization problem using computer simulations. The problem was a simplified version of a problem in medical imaging: determining loci of cerebral activity from electromagnetic measurements at the scalp. The simulations showed that gradient based systems typically settled 50 to 100 times faster than systems based on current neural network optimization methods.},

The memory capacity is found to be much smaller than the Kosko upper bound, which is the lesser of the two dimensions of the BAM. On the average, a 64×64 BAM has about 68 % of the capacity of the corresponding Hopfield memory with the same number of neurons. Orthonormal coding of the BAM Increases the effective storage capacity by only 25 %. The memory capacity limitations are due to spurious stable states, which arise in BAMs in much the same way as in Hopfleld memories. Occurrence of spurious stable states can be avoided by replacing the thresholding in the backlayer of the BAM by another nonlinear process, here called Dominant Label Selection (DLS). The simplest DLS is the winner-take-all net, which gives a fault-sensitive memory. Fault tolerance can be improved by the use of an orthogonal or unitary transformation. An optical application of the latter is a Fourier transform, which is implemented simply by a lens.},

If the output neurons can take on only one of two states, then the trained layered APNN can be easily configured to converge in one iteration. More generally, convergence is at an exponential rate. Convergence can be improved by the use of sigmoid type nonlinearities, network relaxation and/or increasing the number of neurons in the hidden layer.

It can be shown that a straightforward generalization of the tropism phenomenon allows the efficient implementation of effective algorithms which appear to respond intelligently to changing environmental conditions.

 abstract = {We describe a new learning procedure for networks that contain groups of nonlinear units arranged in a closed loop. The aim of the learning is to discover codes that allow the activity vectors in a group to be represented by activity vectors in a group. One way to test whether a code is an accurate representation is to try to reconstruct the visible vector from the hidden vector. The difference between the original and the reconstructed visible vectors is called the reconstruction error, and the learning procedure aims to minimize this error. The learning procedure has two passes. On the first pass, the original visible vector is passed around the loop, and on the second pass an average of the original vector and the reconstructed vector is passed around the loop. The learning procedure changes each weight by an amount proportional to the product of the presynaptic activity and the difference in the post-synaptic activity on the two passes. This procedure is much simpler to implement than methods like back-propagation. Simulations in simple networks show that it usually converges rapidly on a good set of codes, and analysis shows that in certain restricted cases it performs gradient descent in the squared reconstruction error.},

 abstract = {The study of distributed memory systems has produced a number of models which work well in limited domains. However, until recently, the application of such systems to real-world problems has been difficult because of storage limitations, and their inherent architectural (and for serial simulation, computational) complexity. Recent development of memories with unrestricted storage capacity and economical feedforward architectures has opened the way to the application of such systems to complex pattern recognition problems. However, such problems are sometimes underspecified by the features which describe the environment, and thus a significant portion of the pattern environment is often non-separable. We will review current work on high density memory systems and their network implementations. We will discuss a general learning algorithm for such high density memories and review its application to separable point sets. Finally, we will introduce an extension of this method for learning the probability distributions of non-separable point sets.},

 abstract = {Previous work on nets with continuous-valued inputs led to generative procedures to construct convex decision regions with two-layer perceptrons (one hidden layer) and arbitrary decision regions with three-layer perceptrons (two hidden layers). Here we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation can form both convex and disjoint decision regions. Such classifiers are robust, train rapidly, and provide good performance with simple decision regions. When complex decision regions are required, however, convergence time can be excessively long and performance is often no better than that of k-nearest neighbor classifiers. Three neural net classifiers are presented that provide more rapid training under such situations. Two use fixed weights in the first one or two layers and are similar to classifiers that estimate probability density functions using histograms. A third feature map uses both unsupervised and supervised training. It provides good performance with little supervised training in situations such as speech recognition where much unlabeled training data is available. The architecture of this classifier can be used to implement a neural net k-nearest neighbor classifier.},

This type of communication contrasts with that which is assumed in most other models which typically are continuous or discrete value-passing networks. Limiting the messages received by each processing unit to time markers that signal the firing of other units presents significant implementation advantages.

In our model, neurons fire spontaneously and regularly in the absence of perturbation. When interaction is present, the scheduled firings are advanced or delayed by the firing of neighboring neurons. Networks of such neurons become global oscillators which exhibit multiple synchronizing attractors. From arbitrary initial states, energy minimization learning procedures can make the network converge to oscillatory modes that satisfy multi-dimensional constraints Such networks can directly represent routing and scheduling problems that consist of ordering sequences of events.},

The representation saturates gracefully as larger structures are represented; it permits recursive construction of complex representations from simpler ones; it respects the independence of the capacities to generate and maintain multiple bindings in parallel; it extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it permits values to also serve as variables; it enables analysis of the interference of symbolic structures stored in associative memories; and it leads to characterization of optimal distributed representations of roles and a recirculation algorithm for learning them.},

Basin measurement circuitry periodically opens the network feedback loop, loads raster-scanned initial conditions and examines the resulting attractor. Plotting the basins for fixed points (memories), we show that overloading an associative memory network leads to irregular basin shapes. The network also includes analog time delay circuitry, and we have shown that delay in symmetric networks can introduce basins for oscillatory attractors. Conditions leading to oscillation are related to the presence of frustration; reducing frustration by diluting the connections can stabilize a delay network.},

Since the neurons are kept off-chip, the synaptic chip serves as a cascadable building block for a multi-chip synaptic network as large as 512×512 in size. As an alternative to the programmable NMOSFET (long channel) connection elements, tailored thin film resistors are deposited, in series with FET switches, on some CMOS test chips, to obtain the weak synaptic connections. Although deposition and patterning of the resistors require additional processing steps, they promise substantial savings in silcon area. The performance of a synaptic chip in a 32- neuron breadboard system in an associative memory test application is discussed.},

The algorithm, which resembles a new lightness algorithm recently proposed by Land, is approximately equivalent to filtering the image through a center-surround receptive field in individual chromatic channels. The synthesizing technique, optimal linear estimation, requires only one assumption, that the operator that transforms input into output is linear. This assumption is true for a certain class of early vision algorithms that may therefore be synthesized in a similar way from examples. Other methods of synthesizing algorithms from examples, or learning, such as backpropagation, do not yield a significantly different or better lightness algorithm in the Mondrian world. The linear estimation and backpropagation techniques both produce simultaneous brightness contrast effects.},

 abstract = {A general method for deriving backpropagation algorithms for networks with recurrent and higher order networks is introduced. The propagation of activation in these networks is determined by dissipative differential equations. The error signal is backpropagated by integrating an associated differential equation. The method is introduced by applying it to the recurrent generalization of the feedforward backpropagation network. The method is extended to the case of higher order networks and to a constrained dynamical system for training a content addressable memory. The essential feature of the adaptive algorithms is that adaptive equation has a simple outer product form.

Preliminary experiments suggest that learning can occur very rapidly in networks with recurrent connections. The continuous formalism makes the new approach more suitable for implementation in VLSI.},

 abstract = {This paper deals with a neural network model in which each neuron performs a threshold logic function. An important property of the model is that it always converges to a stable state when operating in a serial mode. This property is the basis of the potential applications of the model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization. One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial problems is the fact that it can be implemented by optical devices and thus operate at a higher speed than conventional electronics. The main theme in this work is to investigate the power of the model for solving NP-hard problems and to understand the relation between speed of operation and the size of a neural network. In particular, it will be shown that for any NP-hard problem the existence of a polynomial size network that solves it implies that NP = co-NP. Also, for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), even a polynomial size network that gets an e-approximate solution does not exist unless P = NP. The above results are of great practical interest, because right now it is possible to build neural networks which will operate fast but are limited in the number of neurons they contain.},

The Hebbian learn­ ing rule and the delta learning rule are generalized accordingly, resulting in the learning of weights and delays.

 abstract = {Intracellular recordings in spinal cord motoneurons and cerebral cortex neurons have provided new evidence on the correlational strength of monosynaptic connections, and the relation between the shapes of postsynaptic potentials and the associated increased firing probability. In these cells, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) produce cross-correlogram peaks which resemble in large part the derivative of the EPSP. Additional synaptic noise broadens the peak, but the peak area -- i.e., the number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to the EPSP amplitude. A typical EPSP of 100 µv triggers about .01 firings per EPSP. The consequences of these data for information processing by polysynaptic connections is discussed. The effects of sequential polysynaptic links can be calculated by convolving the effects of the underlying monosynaptic connections. The net effect of parallel pathways is the sum of the individual contributions.},

The higher stage is a neural network model that treats the cerebellum as an array of adjustable motor pattern generators. This network uses sensory input to preset and to trigger elemental pattern generators and to evaluate their performance. The actual patterned outputs, however, are produced by intrinsic circuitry that includes recurrent loops and is thus capable of self-sustained activity. These patterned outputs are sent as motor commands to local feedback systems called motor servos. The latter control the forces and lengths of individual muscles. Overall control is thus achieved in two stages: (1) an adaptive cerebellar network generates an array of feedforward motor commands and (2) a set of local feedback systems translates these commands into actual movements.},

A serious problem of unwanted spontaneous oscillation often arises with these circuits and renders them unusable in practice. This paper reports a design approach that guarantees such a system will be stable, even though the values of designed elements and parasitic elements in the resistive grid may be unknown. The method is based on a rigorous, somewhat novel mathematical analysis using Tellegen's theorem and the idea of Popov multipliers from control theory. It is thoroughly practical because the criteria are local in the sense that no overall analysis of the interconnected system is required, empirical in the sense that they involve only measurable frequency response data on the individual cells, and robust in the sense that unmodelled parasitic resistances and capacitances in the interconnection network cannot affect the analysis.},

 abstract = {Many optimization models of neural networks need constraints to restrict the space of outputs to a subspace which satisfies external criteria. Optimizations using energy methods yield which act upon the state of the neural network. The penalty method, in which quadratic energy constraints are added to an existing optimization energy, has become popular recently, but is not guaranteed to satisfy the constraint conditions when there are other forces on the neural model or when there are multiple constraints. In this paper, we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM), which satisfies constraints exactly; we create forces which gradually apply the constraints over time, using neurons that estimate Lagrange multipliers.

The basic differential multiplier method is a differential version of the method of multipliers from Numerical Analysis. We prove that the differential equations locally converge to a constrained minimum.

Examples of applications of the differential method of multipliers include enforcing permutation codewords in the analog decoding problem and enforcing valid tours in the traveling salesman problem.},

By requiring each unit to satisfy a set of constraints on the interconnection weights, a particular structure is imposed on the network. A network built using such an architecture maintains its invariant performance independent of the values the weights assume, of the learning rules used, and of the form of the nonlinearities in the network. The invariance exhibited by a first-order network is usually of a trivial sort, e.g., responding only to the average input in the case of translation invariance, whereas higher-order networks can perform useful functions and still exhibit the invariance.

 abstract = {An increasing number of profoundly deaf patients suffering from sensorineural deafness are using cochlear implants as prostheses. After the implant, sound can be detected through the electrical stimulation of the remaining peripheral auditory nervous system. Although great progress has been achieved in this area, no useful speech recognition has been attained with either single or multiple channel cochlear implants.

Coding evidence suggests that it is necessary for any implant which would effectively couple with the natural speech perception system to simulate the temporal dispersion and other phenomena found in the natural receptors, and currently not implemented in any cochlear implants. To this end, it is presented here a computational model using artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate the natural phenomena in the artificial cochlear.

The ANN model presents a series of advantages to the implementation of such systems. First, the hardware requirements, with constraints on power, size, and processing speeds, can be taken into account together with the development of the underlining software, before the actual neural structures are totally defined. Second, the ANN model, since it is an abstraction of natural neurons, carries the necessary ingredients and is a close mapping for implementing the necessary functions. Third, some of the processing, like sorting and majority functions, could be implemented more efficiently, requiring only local decisions. Fourth, the ANN model allows function modifications through parametric modification (no software recoding), which permits a variety of fine-tuning experiments, with the opinion of the patients, to be conceived. Some of those will permit the user some freedom in system modification at real-time, allowing finer and more subjective adjustments to fit differences on the condition and operation of individual's remaining peripheral auditory system.},

It is shown by sphere packing arguments that as the address length increases, the capacity of any associative memory is limited to an exponential growth rate of 1 - h2(δ), where h2(δ) is the binary entropy function in bits, and δ is the radius of the sphere of attraction. This exponential growth in capacity can actually be achieved by the Kanerva associative memory, if its parameters are optimally set. Formulas for these optimal values are provided.

This relationship takes the form of a sigmoid curve, that describes normalized pulse-output for normalized wave input. The curve is fitted using nonlinear regression and is described by its slope and maximum value.

Measurements were made for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the cortex. These neurons are known to form a monosynaptic negative feedback loop. Both classes of cells can be described by the same parameters.

The sigmoid curve is asymmetric in that the region of maximal slope is displaced toward the excitatory side. The data are compatible with Freeman's model of prepyriform burst generation. Other analogies with existing neural nets are being discussed, and the implications for signal processing are reviewed. In particular the relationship of sigmoid slope to efficiency of neural computation is examined.},

The first half of the paper describes the model. The second half discusses some of its significant adaptive properties using computer simulation examples. Chief among these properties is that network aggregates of the model elements can adapt appropriately when a single reinforcement channel provides the same positive or negative reinforcement signal to all adaptive elements of the network at the same time. This holds for multiple-input, multiple-output, multiple-layered, combinational and sequential networks. It also holds when some network elements are hidden in that their outputs are not directly seen by the external environment.},

In most neurophysiology laboratories this classification task is simplified by limiting investigations to single, electrically well-isolated neurons recorded one at a time. However, for those interested in sampling the activities of many single neurons simultaneously, waveform classification becomes a serious concern. In this paper we describe and constrast three approaches to this problem each designed not only to recognize isolated neural events, but also to separately classify temporally overlapping events in real time. First we present two formulations of waveform classification using a neural network template matching approach. These two formulations are then compared to a simple template matching implementation. Analysis with real neural signals reveals that simple template matching is a better solution to this problem than either neural network approach.},

 abstract = {Based on anatomical and physiological data, we have developed a computer simulation of piri-form (olfactory) cortex which is capable of reproducing spatial and temporal patterns of actual cortical activity under a variety of conditions. Using a simple Hebb-type learning rule in conjunction with the cortical dynamics which emerge from the anatomical and physiological organization of the model, the simulations are capable of establishing cortical representations for different input patterns. The basis of these representations lies in the interaction of sparsely distributed, highly divergent/convergent interconnections between modeled neurons. We have shown that different representations can be stored with minimal interference. and that following learning these representations are resistant to input degradation, allowing reconstruction of a representation following only a partial presentation of an original training stimulus. Further, we have demonstrated that the degree of overlap of cortical representations for different stimuli can also be modulated. For instance similar input patterns can be induced to generate distinct cortical representations (discrimination). while dissimilar inputs can be induced to generate overlapping representations (accommodation). Both features are presumably important in classifying olfactory stimuli.},

 abstract = {An information-theoretic optimization principle is proposed for the development of each processing stage of a multilayered perceptual network. This principle of maximum information preservation states that the signal transformation that is to be realized at each stage is one that maximizes the information that the output signal values (from that stage) convey about the input signals values (to that stage), subject to certain constraints and in the presence of processing noise. The quantity being maximized is a Shannon information rate. I provide motivation for this principle and -- for some simple model cases -- derive some of its consequences, discuss an algorithmic implementation, and show how the principle may lead to biologically relevant neural architectural features such as topographic maps, map distortions, orientation selectivity, and extraction of spatial and temporal signal correlations. A possible connection between this information-theoretic principle and a principle of minimum entropy production in nonequilibrium thermodynamics is suggested.},

 abstract = {We describe a family of learning algorithms that operate on a recurrent, symmetrically connected, neuromorphic network that, like the Boltzmann machine, settles in the presence of noise. These networks learn by modifying synaptic connection strengths on the basis of correlations seen locally by each synapse. We describe a version of the supervised learning algorithm for a network with analog activation functions. We also demonstrate unsupervised competitive learning with this approach, where weight saturation and decay play an important role, and describe preliminary experiments in reinforcement learning, where noise is used in the search procedure. We identify the above described phenomena as elements that can unify learning techniques at a physical microscopic level.

These algorithms were chosen for ease of implementation in vlsi. We have designed a CMOS test chip in 2 micron rules that can speed up the learning about a millionfold over an equivalent simulation on a VAX 11/780. The speedup is due to parallel analog computation for summing and multiplying weights and activations, and the use of physical processes for generating random noise. The components of the test chip are a noise amplifier, a neuron amplifier, and a 300 transistor adaptive synapse, each of which is separately testable. These components are also integrated into a 6 neuron and 15 synapse network. Finally, we point out techniques for reducing the area of the electronic correlational synapse both in technology and design and show how the algorithms we study can be implemented naturally in electronic systems.},

@inproceedings{NIPS1987_f7177163,
 abstract = {To process sensory data, sensory brain areas must preserve information about both the similarities and differences among learned cues: without the latter, acuity would be lost, whereas without the former, degraded versions of a cue would be erroneously thought to be distinct cues, and would not be recognized. We have constructed a model of piriform cortex incorporating a large number of biophysical, anatomical and physiological parameters, such as two-step excitatory firing thresholds, necessary and sufficient conditions for long-term potentiation (LTP) of synapses, three distinct types of inhibitory currents (short IPSPs, long hyperpolarizing currents (LHP) and long cellspecific afterhyperpolarization (AHP)), sparse connectivity between bulb and layer-II cortex, caudally-flowing excitatory collateral fibers, nonlinear dendritic summation, etc. We have tested the model for its ability to learn similarity- and difference-preserving encodings of incoming sensory cue; the biological characteristics of the model enable it to produce multiple encodings of each input cue in such a way that different readouts of the cell firing activity of the model preserve both similarity and difference information.

In particular, probabilistic quantal transmitter-release properties of piriform synapses give rise to probabilistic postsynaptic voltage levels which, in combination with the activity of local patches of inhibitory interneurons in layer II, differentially select bursting vs. single-pulsing layer-II cells. Time-locked firing to the theta rhythm (Larson and Lynch, 1986) enables distinct spatial patterns to be read out against a relatively quiescent background firing rate. Training trials using the physiological rules for induction of LTP yield stable layer-II-cell spatial firing patterns for learned cues. Multiple simulated olfactory input patterns (i.e., those that share many chemical features) will give rise to strongly-overlapping bulb firing patterns, activating many shared lateral olfactory tract (LOT) axons innervating layer Ia of piriform cortex, which in turn yields highly overlapping layer-II-cell excitatory potentials, enabling this spatial layer-II-cell encoding to preserve the overlap (similarity) among similar inputs. At the same time, those synapses that are enhanced by the learning process cause stronger cell firing, yielding strong, cell-specific afterhyperpolarizing (AHP) currents. Local inhibitory intemeurons effectively select alternate cells to fire once strongly-firing cells have undergone AHP. These alternate cells then activate their caudally-flowing recurrent collaterals, activating distinct populations of synapses in caudal layer lb. Potentiation of these synapses in combination with those of still-active LOT axons selectively enhance the response of caudal cells that tend to accentuate the differences among even very-similar cues.

Empirical tests of the computer simulation have shown that, after training, the initial spatial layer II cell firing responses to similar cues enhance the similarity of the cues, such that the overlap in response is equal to or greater than the overlap in input cell firing (in the bulb): e.g., two cues that overlap by 65% give rise to response patterns that overlap by 80% or more. Reciprocally, later cell firing patterns (after AHP), increasingly enhance the differences among even very-similar patterns, so that cues with 90% input overlap give rise to output responses that overlap by less than 10%. This difference-enhancing response can be measured with respect to its acuity; since 90% input overlaps are reduced to near zero response overlaps, it enables the structure to distinguish between even very-similar cues. On the other hand, the similarity-enhancing response is properly viewed as a partitioning mechanism, mapping quite-distinct input cues onto nearly-identical response patterns (or category indicators). We therefore use a statistical metric for the information value of categorizations to measure the value of partitionings produced by the piriform simulation network.},

For small r's a city-block error metric is approximated and for large r's the maximum or supremum metric is approached. while for r=2 the standard back-propagation model results. An implementation of Minkowski-r back-propagation is described, and several experiments are done which show that different values of r may be desirable for various purposes.
