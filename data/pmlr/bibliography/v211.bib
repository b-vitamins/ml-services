 abstract = {Real-time and human-interpretable decision-making in autonomous systems is a significant but challenging task, which usually requires predictions of possible future events from limited data. While machine learning techniques have achieved promising results in this field, they lack interpretability and the ability to make online predictions for sequential behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a time-incremental learning framework to predict the labels of time-series signals that are received incrementally over time, referred to as prefix signals. These signals are being observed as they are generated, and their time lengths are shorter than their corresponding time horizons. We present a novel decision tree-based approach to learn a finite number of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications from a given dataset and construct a predictor based on them. Each STL specification serves as a binary classifier of the time-series data and captures a specific part of the datasetâs temporal properties over time. The predictor is built by assigning time-variant weights to the STL  formulas, which represent their classification impacts. The weights are learned using neural networks to minimize the misclassification rate of classifying prefix signals with different time lengths. The predictor is then used to predict the labels of prefix signals by computing the weighted sum of their robustnesses with respect to the STL formulas. The effectiveness and classification performance of our algorithm is evaluated on urban-driving and naval-surveillance case studies.},

 abstract = {We address a benchmark task in agile robotics: catching objects thrown at high-speed. This is a challenging task that involves tracking, intercepting, and cradling a thrown object with access only to visual observations of the object and the proprioceptive state of the robot, all within a fraction of a second. We present the relative merits of two fundamentally different solution strategies: (i) Model Predictive Control using accelerated constrained trajectory optimization, and (ii) Reinforcement Learning using zeroth-order optimization. We provide insights into various performance trade-offs including sample efficiency, sim-to-real transfer, robustness to distribution shifts, and whole-body multimodality via extensive on-hardware experiments. We conclude with proposals on fusing "classical" and "learning-based" techniques for agile robot control. Videos of our experiments may be found at https://sites.google.com/view/agile-catching},

At the same time, we use data to learn parameters of the dynamics model, of an extended Kalman filter, and of a neural model that infers the ball's initial condition. We demonstrate superior prediction performance of our approach over two black-box approaches, which are not supplied with physical prior knowledge. We demonstrate that initializing the spin from parameters of the ball launcher using a neural network drastically improves long-time prediction performance over estimating the spin purely from measured ball positions. An accurate prediction of the ball trajectory is crucial for successful returns. We therefore evaluate the return performance with a pneumatic artificial muscular robot and achieve a return rate of 29/30 (97.7%).},

 abstract = {In this paper, we leverage the rapid advances in imitation learning, a topic of intense recent focus in the Reinforcement Learning (RL) literature, to develop new sample complexity results and performance guarantees for data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) for constrained linear systems. In its simplest form, imitation learning is an approach that tries to learn an expert policy by querying samples from an expert. Recent approaches to data-driven MPC have used the simplest form of imitation learning known as behavior cloning to learn controllers that mimic the performance of MPC by online sampling of the trajectories of the closed-loop MPC system. Behavior cloning, however, is a method that is known to be data inefficient and suffer from distribution shifts. As an alternative, we develop a variant of the forward training algorithm which is an on-policy imitation learning method proposed by Ross et al. (2010). Our algorithm uses the structure of constrained linear MPC, and our analysis uses the properties of the explicit MPC solution to theoretically bound the number of online MPC trajectories needed to achieve optimal performance. We validate our results through simulations and show that the forward training algorithm is indeed superior to behavior cloning when applied to MPC.},

This paper proposes a method to efficiently learn these disturbances online, in a risk-aware context. First, we introduce the concept of a Surface-at-Risk, a risk measure for stochastic processes that extends Value-at-Risk -- a commonly utilized risk measure in the risk-aware controls community. Second, we model the norm of the state discrepancy between the model and the true system evolution as a scalar-valued stochastic process and determine an upper bound to its Surface-at-Risk via Gaussian Process Regression. Third, we provide theoretical results on the accuracy of our fitted surface subject to mild assumptions that are verifiable with respect to the data sets collected during system operation. Finally, we experimentally verify our procedure by augmenting a drone's controller and highlight performance increases achieved via our risk-aware approach after collecting less than a minute of operating data.},

 abstract = {Multi-robot manipulation tasks involve various control entities that can be separated into dynamically independent parts. A typical example of such real-world tasks is dual-arm manipulation. Learning to naively solve such tasks with reinforcement learning is often unfeasible due to the sample complexity and exploration requirements growing with the dimensionality of the action and state spaces. Instead, we would like to handle such environments as multi-agent systems and have several agents control parts of the whole. However, decentralizing the generation of actions requires coordination across agents through a channel limited to information central to the task. This paper proposes an approach to coordinating multi-robot manipulation through learned latent action spaces that are shared across different agents. We validate our method in simulated multi-robot manipulation tasks and demonstrate improvement over previous baselines in terms of sample efficiency and learning performance.},

 abstract = {We introduce a distributed policy gradient play algorithm with networked agents playing Markov potential games. Agents have rewards at each stage of the game, that depend on the joint actions of agents given a common dynamic state. Agents implement parameterized and differentiable policies to take actions against each other. Markov potential assumes the existence of potential value functions. In a differentiable Markov potential game, partial gradients of a potential function are equal to the local gradients with respect to the individual parameters. In this work, agents receive information on other agentsâ parameters via a communication network in addition to rewards. Agents then use stochastic gradients with respect to local estimates of joint policy parameters to update their policy parameters. We show that agentsâ joint policy converges to a first-order stationary point of Markov potential value function with any type of function approximation, state and action spaces. Numerical experiments confirm the convergence result in the lake game, a Markov potential game.},

Using video clips as input data, the encoder may be used to describe the movement of an object in the video without ground truth data (unsupervised learning). Even though the object's dynamics is typically based on first principles, this prior knowledge is mostly ignored in the existing literature. Thus, we propose a physics-enhanced variational autoencoder that places a physical-enhanced Gaussian process prior on the latent dynamics to improve the efficiency of the variational autoencoder and to allow physically correct predictions. The physical prior knowledge expressed as linear dynamical system is here reflected by the Green's function and included in the kernel function of the Gaussian process. The benefits of the proposed approach are highlighted in a simulation with an oscillating particle.},

Our algorithm divides the input domain into finitely many polyhedral regions whose shapes are specified using a user-defined template such that the data points in each region are fit by an affine function within a desired error bound. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard. Next, we present a top-down algorithm that considers subsets of the overall data set in a systematic manner, trying to fit an affine function for each subset using linear regression. If regression fails on a subset, we extract a minimal set of points that led to a failure in order to split the original index set into smaller subsets. Using a combination of this top-down scheme and a set covering algorithm, we derive an overall approach that is optimal in terms of the number of pieces of the resulting PWA model. We demonstrate our approach on two numerical examples that include PWA approximations of a widely used nonlinear insulin--glucose regulation model and a double inverted pendulum with soft contacts.},

We define three operator mappings in adaptive control-the parameter identifier operator, the controller gain operator, and the control operator. We introduce neural operators for learning both the parameter identification mapping and the gain function mapping to produce the control action at each step. Through the formalization of neural operators, we are able to learn these mappings for a wide set of different system parameter values without retraining. Empirically, we test our controller on two experiments ranging from an aircraft system (a nonlinear ODE) to a first-order hyperbolic PDE system. We demonstrate that the accuracy of both the gain function and parameter approximation can reach the magnitude of $10^{â4}$ with speedups around 98% compared to numer- ical solvers. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that despite error propagation, closed-loop stability guarantees are maintained when substituting neural operator approximations.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a simple strategy for sim-to-real in Deep-Reinforcement Learning (DRL) -- called Roll-Drop -- that uses dropout during simulation to account for observation noise during deployment without explicitly modelling its distribution for each state. DRL is a promising approach to control robots for highly dynamic and feedback-based manoeuvres, and accurate simulators are crucial to providing cheap and abundant data to learn the desired behaviour. Nevertheless, the simulated data are noiseless and generally show a distributional shift that challenges the deployment on real machines where sensor readings are affected by noise. The standard solution is modelling the latter and injecting it during training; while this requires a thorough system identification, Roll-Drop enhances the robustness to sensor noise by tuning only a single parameter. We demonstrate an 80% success rate when up to 25% noise is injected in the observations, with twice higher robustness than the baselines. We deploy the controller trained in simulation on a Unitree A1 platform and assess this improved robustness on the physical system.},

Nonetheless, the learned controllers can behave unexpectedly if the trajectories of the system divert from the training data distribution, which can compromise safety. In this work, we propose a control filter that wraps any reference policy and effectively encourages the system to stay in-distribution with respect to offline-collected safe demonstrations. Our methodology is inspired by Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), which are model-based tools from the nonlinear control literature that can be used to construct minimally invasive safe policy filters. While existing methods based on CBFs require a known low-dimensional state representation, our proposed approach is directly applicable to systems that rely solely on high-dimensional visual observations by learning in a latent state-space. We demonstrate that our method is effective for two different visuomotor control tasks in simulation environments, including both top-down and egocentric view settings.},

 abstract = {Control for tokamaks, the leading candidate technology for nuclear fusion, is an important pursuit since the realization of nuclear fusion as an energy source would result in virtually unlimited clean energy. However, control of these devices remains a challenging problem due to complex, non-linear dynamics. At the same time, there is promise in learning controllers for difficult problems thanks to recent algorithmic developments in reinforcement learning. Because every run (or shot) of the tokamak is extremely expensive, in this work, we investigated learning a controller from logged data before testing it on a tokamak. In particular, we used 18 years of data from the DIII-D device in order to learn a controller for the neutral beams that targets specified $\beta_N$ (normalized ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) and rotation quantities. This was done by using the data to first learn a dynamics model, and then by using this model as a simulator to generate experience to train a controller via reinforcement learning. During a control session on DIII-D, we tested both the ability for our dynamics model to design feedforward trajectories and the controllerâs ability to do feedback control to achieve specified targets. This work marks some of the first steps in doing reinforcement learning for tokamak control through historical data alone.},

In this framework, an optimization problem, subjected to a set of dynamics constraints characterized by a nonlinear dynamics model, is solved at each time step. Despite its versatility, the performance of nonlinear MPC often depends on the accuracy of the dynamics model. In this work, we leverage deep learning tools, namely knowledge-based neural ordinary differential equations (KNODE) and deep ensembles, to improve the prediction accuracy of this model. In particular, we learn an ensemble of KNODE models, which we refer to as the KNODE ensemble, to obtain an accurate prediction of the true system dynamics. This learned model is then integrated into a novel learning-enhanced nonlinear MPC framework. We provide sufficient conditions that guarantees asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and show that these conditions can be implemented in practice. We show that the KNODE ensemble provides more accurate predictions and illustrate the efficacy and closed-loop performance of the proposed nonlinear MPC framework using two case studies.},

We adopted the notion of dynamic regret to measure the performance of this proposed online LQR control method, with our main result being that the (dynamic) regret of our method is upper bounded by a constant. Moreover, the regret upper bound decays exponentially with the preview window length, and is extendable to systems with disturbances.

 abstract = {Despite the immense success of deep learning in reinforcement learning and control, few theoretical guarantees for neural networks exist for these problems. Deriving performance guarantees is challenging because control is an online problem with no distributional assumptions and an agnostic learning objective, while the theory of deep learning so far focuses on supervised learning with a fixed known training set. In this work, we begin to resolve these challenges and derive the first regret guarantees in online control over a neural network-based policy class. In particular, we show sublinear episodic regret guarantees against a policy class parameterized by deep neural networks, a much richer class than previously considered linear policy parameterizations. Our results center on a reduction from online learning of neural networks to online convex optimization (OCO), and can use any OCO algorithm as a blackbox. Since online learning guarantees are inherently agnostic, we need to quantify the performance of the best policy in our policy class. To this end, we introduce the interpolation dimension, an expressivity metric, which we use to accompany our regret bounds. The results and findings in online deep learning are of independent interest and may have applications beyond online control.},

 abstract = {Safe reinforcement learning (RL) with assured satisfaction of hard state constraints during training has recently received a lot of attention. Safety filters, e.g., based on control barrier functions (CBFs), provide a promising way for safe RL via modifying the unsafe actions of an RL agent on the fly. Existing safety filter-based approaches typically involve learning of uncertain dynamics and quantifying the learned model error, which leads to conservative filters before a large amount of data is collected to learn a good model, thereby preventing efficient exploration. This paper presents a method for safe and efficient RL using disturbance observers (DOBs) and control barrier functions (CBFs). Unlike most existing safe RL methods that deal with hard state constraints, our method does not involve model learning, and leverages DOBs to accurately estimate the pointwise value of the uncertainty, which is then incorporated into a robust CBF condition to generate safe actions. The DOB-based CBF can be used as a safety filter with model-free RL algorithms by minimally modifying the actions of an RL agent whenever necessary to ensure safety throughout the learning process. Simulation results on a unicycle and a 2D quadrotor demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art safe RL algorithm using CBFs and Gaussian processes-based model learning, in terms of safety violation rate, and sample and computational efficiency.},

 abstract = {Controller tuning is a vital step to ensure the controller delivers its designed performance. DiffTune has been proposed as an automatic tuning method that unrolls the dynamical system and controller into a computational graph and uses auto-differentiation to obtain the gradient for the controller's parameter update. However, DiffTune uses the vanilla gradient descent to iteratively update the parameter, in which the performance largely depends on the choice of the learning rate (as a hyperparameter). In this paper, we propose to use hyperparameter-free methods to update the controller parameters. We find the optimal parameter update by maximizing the loss reduction, where a predicted loss based on the approximated state and control is used for the maximization. Two methods are proposed to optimally update the parameters and are compared with related variants in simulations on a Dubin's car and a quadrotor. Simulation experiments show that the proposed first-order method outperforms the hyperparameter-based methods and is more robust than the second-order hyperparameter-free methods.},

 abstract = {One of the long-term objectives of Machine Learning  is to endow machines with the capacity of structuring and interpreting the world as we do. This is particularly challenging in scenes involving time series, such as video sequences, since seemingly different data can correspond to the same underlying dynamics.  Recent approaches seek to decompose video sequences into their composing objects, attributes and dynamics in a self-supervised fashion, thus simplifying the task of learning suitable features that can be used to analyze each component.  While existing methods can successfully  disentangle dynamics from other components, there have been relatively few efforts in learning parsimonious representations of these underlying dynamics. In this paper, motivated by recent advances in non-linear identification, we propose a method to decompose a video into moving objects, their attributes and the dynamic modes of their trajectories. We model video dynamics as the output of a Koopman operator to be learned from the available data. In this context, the dynamic information contained in the scene is encapsulated in the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Koopman operator,  providing an interpretable and parsimonious representation. We show that such decomposition can be used for instance to perform video analytics, predict future frames or generate synthetic video. We test our framework in a variety of datasets that encompass different dynamic scenarios, while illustrating the novel features that emerge from our dynamic modes decomposition: Video dynamics interpretation and user manipulation at test-time. We successfully forecast challenging object trajectories from pixels, achieving competitive performance while drawing useful insights.},

 abstract = {A key barrier to using reinforcement learning (RL) in many real-world applications is the requirement of a large number of system interactions to learn a good control policy. Off-policy and Offline RL methods have been proposed to reduce the number of interactions with the physical environment by learning control policies from historical data. However, their performances suffer from the lack of exploration and the distributional shifts in trajectories once controllers are updated. Moreover, most RL methods require that all states are directly observed, which is difficult to be attained in many settings. To overcome these challenges, we propose a trajectory generation algorithm, which adaptively generates new trajectories as if the system is being operated and explored under the updated control policies. Motivated by the fundamental lemma for linear systems, assuming sufficient excitation, we generate trajectories from linear combinations of historical trajectories. For linear feedback control, we prove that the algorithm generates trajectories with the exact distribution as if they are sampled from the real system using the updated control policy. In particular, the algorithm extends to systems where the states are not directly observed. Experiments show that the proposed method significantly reduces the number of sampled data needed for RL algorithms.},

In our research, we investigate this latter phenomenon in two contexts: (a) discrete-time dynamical system identification, and (b) the calibration of a neural network's output to that of another network. We examine noninvertibility through the lens of mathematical optimization, where the global solution measures the ``safety" of the network predictions by their distance from the non-invertibility boundary. We formulate mixed-integer programs (MIPs) for ReLU networks and $L_p$ norms ($p=1,2,\infty$) that apply to neural network approximators of dynamical systems. We also discuss how our findings can be useful for invertibility certification in transformations between neural networks, e.g. between different levels of network pruning.},

Under the formulation of risk-sensitive linear quadratic Gaussian control, a dual-loop policy optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively approximate the robust and optimal controller. The convergence and robustness of the dual-loop policy optimization algorithm are rigorously analyzed. It is shown that the dual-loop policy optimization algorithm uniformly converges to the optimal solution. In addition, by invoking the concept of small-disturbance input-to-state stability, it is guaranteed that the dual-loop policy optimization algorithm still converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution when the algorithm is subject to a sufficiently small disturbance at each step. When the system matrices are unknown, a learning-based off-policy policy optimization algorithm is proposed for the same class of linear systems with additive Gaussian noise. The numerical simulation is implemented to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm. },

Gaussian process (GP) regression is a particularly popular learning method for this purpose due to the existence of prediction error bounds. Moreover, GP models can be efficiently updated online, such that event-triggered online learning strategies can be pursued to ensure specified tracking accuracies. However, existing trigger conditions must be able to be evaluated at arbitrary times, which cannot be achieved in practice due to non-negligible computation times. Therefore, we first derive a delay-aware tracking error bound, which reveals an accuracy-delay trade-off. Based on this result, we propose a novel event trigger for GP-based online learning with computational delays, which we show to offer advantages over offline trained GP models for sufficiently small computation times. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed event trigger for online learning in simulations.},

 abstract = {Microfinance, despite its significant potential for poverty reduction, is facing sustainability hardships due to high default rates. Although many methods in regular finance can estimate credit scores and default probabilities, these methods are not directly applicable to microfinance due to the following unique characteristics: a) under-explored (developing) areas such as rural Africa do not have sufficient prior loan data for microfinance institutions (MFIs) to establish a credit scoring system; b) microfinance applicants may have difficulty providing sufficient information for MFIs to accurately predict default probabilities; and c) many MFIs use group liability (instead of collateral) to secure repayment. Here, we present a novel control-theoretic model of microfinance that accounts for these characteristics. We construct an algorithm to learn microfinance decision policies that achieve financial inclusion, fairness, social welfare, and sustainability. We characterize the convergence conditions to Pareto-optimum and the convergence speeds. We demonstrate, in numerous real and synthetic datasets, that the proposed method accounts for the complexities induced by group liability to produce robust decisions before sufficient loans are given to establish credit scoring systems and for applicants whose default probability cannot be accurately estimated due to missing information. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to connect microfinance and control theory. We envision that the connection will enable safe learning and control techniques to help modernize microfinance and alleviate poverty.},

For such a Markov game, we employ an approach based on the occupancy measure to formulate it as an online constrained saddle-point problem with an explicit constraint.

 abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the value function of an infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted Markov reward process (MRP). We establish non-asymptotic guarantees for a general family of multi-step temporal difference (TD) estimates, including canonical $K$-step look-ahead TD for $K = 1, 2, \ldots$ and the TD$(\lambda)$ family for $\lambda \in [0,1)$ as special cases. Our bounds capture the dependence of these estimates on both the variance as defined by Bellman fluctuations, and the bias arising from possible model mis-specification. Our results reveal that the variance component shows limited sensitivity to the choice of look-ahead defining the estimator itself, while increasing the look-ahead can reduce the bias term. This highlights the benefit of using a larger look-ahead: it reduces bias but need not increase the variance.},

 abstract = {Incorporating prior knowledge of physics laws and structural properties of dynamical systems into the design of deep learning architectures has proven to be a powerful technique for improving their computational efficiency and generalization capacity. Learning accurate models of robot dynamics is critical for safe and stable control. Autonomous mobile robots, including wheeled, aerial, and underwater vehicles, can be modeled as controlled Lagrangian or Hamiltonian rigid-body systems evolving on matrix Lie groups. In this paper, we introduce a new structure-preserving deep learning architecture, the Lie group Forced Variational Integrator Network (LieFVIN), capable of learning controlled Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics on Lie groups, either from position-velocity or position-only data. By design, LieFVINs preserve both the Lie group structure on which the dynamics evolve and the symplectic structure underlying the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian systems of interest. The proposed architecture learns surrogate discrete-time flow maps allowing accurate and fast prediction without numerical-integrator, neural-ODE, or adjoint techniques, which are needed for vector fields. Furthermore, the learnt discrete-time dynamics can be utilized with computationally scalable discrete-time (optimal) control strategies.},

 abstract = {In numerous robotics and mechanical engineering applications, among others, data is often constrained on smooth manifolds due to the presence of rotational degrees of freedom. Common datadriven and learning-based methods such as neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), however, typically fail to satisfy these manifold constraints and perform poorly for these applications. To address this shortcoming, in this paper we study a class of neural ordinary differential equations that, by design, leave a given manifold invariant, and characterize their properties by leveraging the controllability properties of control affine systems. In particular, using a result due to Agrachev and Caponigro on approximating diffeomorphisms with flows of feedback control systems, we show that any map that can be represented as the flow of a manifold-constrained dynamical system can also be approximated using the flow of manifold-constrained neural ODE, whenever a certain controllability condition is satisfied. Additionally, we show that this universal approximation property holds when the neural ODE has limited width in each layer, thus leveraging the depth of network instead for approximation. We verify our theoretical findings using numerical experiments on PyTorch for the manifolds S2 and the 3-dimensional orthogonal group SO(3), which are model manifolds for mechanical systems such as spacecrafts and satellites. We also compare the performance of the manifold invariant neural ODE with classical neural ODEs that ignore the manifold invariant properties and show the superiority of our approach in terms of accuracy and sample complexity.},

 abstract = {We consider a multi-agent episodic MDP setup where an agent (leader) takes action at each step of the episode followed by another agent (follower). The state evolution and rewards depend on the joint action pair of the leader and the follower. Such type of interactions can find applications in many domains such as smart grids, mechanism design, security, and policymaking. We are interested in how to learn policies for both the players with provable performance guarantee under a bandit feedback setting. We focus on a setup where both the leader and followers are {\em non-myopic}, i.e., they both seek to maximize their rewards over the entire episode and consider a linear MDP which can model continuous state-space which is very common in many RL applications. We propose a {\em model-free} RL algorithm and show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^3H^3T})$ regret bounds can be achieved for both the leader and the follower, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the length of the episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps under the bandit feedback information setup. Thus, our result holds even when the number of states becomes infinite. The algorithm relies on {\em novel} adaptation of the LSVI-UCB algorithm. Specifically, we replace the standard greedy policy (as the best response) with the soft-max policy for both the leader and the follower. This turns out to be key in establishing uniform concentration bound for the value functions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sub-linear regret bound guarantee for the Markov games with non-myopic followers with function approximation.},

Using this structural result, we show that several recently proposed online control algorithms achieve the best of both worlds: sublinear regret vs. the best DAC policy selected in hindsight, and optimal competitive ratio, up to an additive correction which grows sublinearly in the time horizon. We further conclude that sublinear regret vs. the optimal competitive policy is attainable when the linear dynamical system is unknown, and even when a stabilizing controller for the dynamics is not available a priori.},

It turns out that the associated gradient flow dynamics exactly correspond to a type of hardware solvers termed oscillator-based Ising machines. We also analyze the advantage of adding angle penalties by leveraging random rounding techniques. Therefore, our work contributes to a rigorous understanding of oscillator-based Ising machines by drawing connections to the penalty method in constrained optimization and providing a rationale for the introduction of sub-harmonic injection locking. Furthermore, we characterize a class of coupling functions between oscillators, which ensures convergence to discrete solutions. This class of coupling functions avoids explicit penalty terms or rounding schemes, which are prevalent in other formulations.},

We consider the metric of cumulative constraint violation $\sum_{t=1}^T(g(x_t))^{+},$ which is strictly stronger than the traditional long-term constraint violation $\sum_{t=1}^Tg(x_t).$ The rectified design for the penalty update and the pessimistic learning for the constraint function in RPOL guarantee the cumulative constraint violation is minimal. RPOL can achieve sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation for SCBwC and its variants (e.g., under delayed feedback and non-stationary environment).

These methods have typically targeted scenes with well-behaved physical parameters and a single body; however, wider ranges of phenomena are important for many real-world settings and serve as stress-tests that probe the strengths and weaknesses of these methods. In this study, we present a large synthesized dataset with diverse scenes, including objects with varying materials and geometries, or multiple objects involved in inter-body collisions. We use this dataset, to compare and contrast recent approaches in a systematic and unified way. Our empirical evaluations show that while some analytical methods work well in some settings and learned (and hybrid) methods work well in others, no existing method excels in all situations, and all tend to struggle as geometric complexity and the number of scene bodies increase.  Our findings call for the collection of more diverse real-world contact datasets for better evaluation of future models. },

 abstract = {On-policy reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be remarkably efficient at learning policies for continuous control robotics tasks. They are highly parallelizable and hence have benefited tremendously from the recent rise in GPU based parallel simulators. The most widely used on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm is proximal policy optimization (PPO) which was introduced in 2017 and was designed for a somewhat different setting with CPU based serial or less parallelizable simulators. However, suprisingly, it has maintained dominance even on tasks based on the highly parallelizable simulators of today. In this paper, we show that a different class of on-policy algorithms based on estimating the policy gradient using the critic-action gradients are better suited when using highly parallelizable simulators. The primary issues for these algorithms arise from the lack of diversity of the on-policy experiences used for the updates and the instabilities arising from the interaction between the biased critic gradients and the rapidly changing policy distribution. We address the former by simply increasing the number of parallel simulation runs (thanks to the GPU based simulators) along with an appropriate schedule on the policy entropy to ensure diversity of samples. We address the latter by adding a policy averaging step and value averaging step (as in off-policy methods). With these modifications, we observe that the critic gradient based on-policy method (CGAC) consistently achieves higher episode returns compared with existing baselines. Furthermore, in environments with high dimensional action space, CGAC also trains much faster (in wall-clock time) than the corresponding baselines.},

However, this lack of assumptions in popular RL algorithms also leads to sample inefficiency. Furthermore, we often have access to a simulator that can provide approximate gradients for the rewards and dynamics of the environment. Iterative learning control (ILC) approaches have been shown to be very efficient at learning policies by using approximate simulator gradients to speed up optimization. However, they lack the generality of reinforcement learning approaches. In this paper, we take inspiration from ILC and propose an update equation for the value-function gradients (computed using the dynamics Jacobians and reward gradient obtained from an approximate simulator) to speed up value-function and policy optimization. We add this update to an off-the-shelf off-policy reinforcement learning algorithm and demonstrate that using the value-gradient update leads to a significant improvement in sample efficiency (and sometimes better performance) both when learning from scratch in a new environment and while fine-tuning a pre-trained policy in a new environment. Moreover, we observe that policies pretrained in the simulator using the simulator jacobians obtain better zero-shot transfer performance and adapt much faster in a new environment.},

 abstract = {The dynamic behaviour, stability, and the effects of the aerodynamic drag of a large-wingspan aircraft are mainly influenced by the structural flexibility and shape of the wings during flight. Therefore, utilizing a wing shape controller that minimizes the effects of drag can greatly improve the behaviour and fuel consumption of the aircraft. However, such a controller requires the measurement of the dynamics of the wing, more precisely, the modal coordinates which describe the structural and dynamic changes of the wing. For estimating the modal coordinates and reconstructing the wing shape a state observer is necessary because the direct and accurate measurement of these states is not feasible. It is demonstrated in this paper that machine learning-based methods can approach the accuracy of traditional model-based Kalman filtering in wing shape estimation. First, the model-based method Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) is presented, using a Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) system model. Second, we present a machine learning-based approach based on the new KalmanNet architecture with two different recurrent neural network configurations: one with linear layers and one with one-dimensional convolutional layers. The results are evaluated on the T-Flex aerial demonstrator aircraft and compared using the LPV-based EKF as a reference. It is shown that the learning-based approach provides comparable results to the model-based method while using fewer design parameters.},

 abstract = {For many network control problems, there exist natural spatial structures and temporal repetition in the network that can be exploited so that controller synthesis does not spend unnecessary time and energy redundantly computing control laws. One notable example of this is vehicle traffic flow over metropolitan intersection networks: spatial symmetries of the network arise from the grid-like structure, while temporal symmetries arise from both the structure and from human routine. In this paper, we propose a controller architecture based on pattern-learning with memory and prediction (PLMP), which exploits these natural symmetries to perform congestion control without redundant computation of light signal sequences. Memory is implemented to store any patterns (intersection snapshots) that have occurred in the past "frequently enough", and redundancy is reduced with an extension of the state-of-the-art episodic control method which builds equivalence classes to group together patterns that can be controlled using the same traffic light. Prediction is implemented to estimate future occurrence times of patterns by predicting vehicle arrivals at subsequent intersections; that way, we schedule light signal sequences in advance. We compare periodic baselines to various implementations of our controller model, including a version of PLMP with prediction excluded called pattern-learning with memory (PLM), by evaluating their performance according to three congestion metrics on two traffic datasets with varying arrival characteristics.},

 abstract = {While many real-world problems that might benefit from reinforcement learning, these problems rarely fit into the MDP mold: interacting with the environment is often expensive and specifying reward functions is challenging. Motivated by these challenges, prior work has developed data-driven approaches that learn entirely from samples from the transition dynamics and examples of high-return states. These methods typically learn a reward function from high-return states, use that reward function to label the transitions, and then apply an offline RL algorithm to these transitions. While these methods can achieve good results on many tasks, they can be complex, often requiring regularization and temporal difference updates. In this paper, we propose a method for offline, example-based control that learns an implicit model of multi-step transitions, rather than a reward function. We show that this implicit model can represent the Q-values for the example-based control problem. Across a range of state-based and image-based offline control tasks, our method outperforms baselines that use learned reward functions; additional experiments demonstrate improved robustness and scaling with dataset size.},

 abstract = {The deployment of robots in uncontrolled environments requires them to operate robustly under previously unseen scenarios, like irregular terrain and wind conditions. Unfortunately, while rigorous safety frameworks from robust optimal control theory scale poorly to high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, control policies computed by more tractable "deep" methods lack guarantees and tend to exhibit little robustness to uncertain operating conditions. This work introduces a novel approach enabling scalable synthesis of robust safety-preserving controllers for robotic systems with general nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded modeling error by combining game-theoretic safety analysis with adversarial reinforcement learning in simulation. Following a soft actor-critic scheme, a safety-seeking fallback policy is co-trained with an adversarial "disturbance" agent that aims to invoke the worst-case realization of model error and training-to-deployment discrepancy allowed by the designer's uncertainty. While the learned control policy does not intrinsically guarantee safety, it is used to construct a real-time safety filter (or shield) with robust safety guarantees based on forward reachability rollouts. This shield can be used in conjunction with a safety-agnostic control policy, precluding any task-driven actions that could result in loss of safety. We evaluate our learning-based safety approach in a 5D race car simulator, compare the learned safety policy to the numerically obtained optimal solution, and empirically validate the robust safety guarantee of our proposed safety shield against worst-case model discrepancy.},

In order to do so, we introduce the notion of the sharpness of a particular constraint set, which characterizes the difficulty of performing learning within the constraint set in an uncertain setting.

Given a neural network, we use an existing verification algorithm to construct inclusion functions for its input-output behavior. Inspired by mixed monotone theory, we embed the closed-loop dynamics into a larger system using an inclusion function of the neural network and a decomposition function of the open-loop system. This embedding provides a scalable approach for safety analysis of the neural control loop while preserving the nonlinear structure of the system. We show that one can efficiently compute hyper-rectangular over-approximations of the reachable sets using a single trajectory of the embedding system. We design an algorithm to leverage this computational advantage through partitioning strategies, improving our reachable set estimates while balancing its runtime with tunable parameters. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm through two case studies. First, we demonstrate this method's strength in complex nonlinear environments. Then, we show that our approach matches the performance of the state-of-the art verification algorithm for linear discretized systems.},

To overcome this, we identify a structure that is simple to check for linear dynamical system, where each player learns in a fully decentralized fashion to minimize its cost. We first establish the existence of pure strategy Nash equilibria in the resulting noncooperative game. We then conjecture that the Nash equilibrium is unique provided that the system satisfies an additional requirement on its structure.

 abstract = {Partially-observable problems pose a trade-off between reducing costs and gathering information. They can be solved optimally by planning in belief space, but that is often prohibitively expensive. Model-predictive control (MPC) takes the alternative approach of using a state estimator to form a belief over the state, and then plan in state space. This ignores potential future observations during planning and, as a result, cannot actively increase or preserve the certainty of its own state estimate. We find a middle-ground between planning in belief space and completely ignoring its dynamics by only reasoning about its future accuracy. Our approach, filter-aware MPC, penalises the loss of information by what we call "trackability", the expected error of the state estimator. We show that model-based simulation allows condensing trackability into a neural network, which allows fast planning. In experiments involving visual navigation, realistic every-day environments and a two-link robot arm, we show that filter-aware MPC vastly improves regular MPC.},

Furthermore, the need for a high-quality state estimation module makes the application of NMPC in real world very challenging, especially for highly agile maneuvers. In this paper, we propose to use NMPC as an expert and learn control policies from proprioceptive sensory measurements. We perform an extensive set of simulations on the quadruped robot Solo12 and show that it is possible to learn different gaits using only proprioceptive sensory information and without any camera or lidar which are normally used to avoid drift in state estimation. Interestingly, our simulation results show that with the same structure of the function approximators, learning estimator and control policy separately outperforms end-to-end learning of dynamic gaits such as jump and bound.},

 abstract = {We propose a physics-based method to learn environmental fields (EFs) using a mobile robot. Common data-driven methods require prohibitively many measurements to accurately learn such complex EFs. On the other hand, while physics-based models provide global knowledge of EFs, they require experimental validation, depend on uncertain parameters, and are intractable to solve onboard mobile robots. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian framework to select and improve upon the most likely physics-based models of EFs in real-time, from a pool of numerical solutions generated offline as a function of the uncertain parameters. Specifically, we use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to construct statistical models of EFs, and rely on the pool of numerical solutions to inform their prior mean. To incorporate flow measurements into these GPs, we control a custom-built mobile robot through a sequence of waypoints that maximize the information content of the measurements. We experimentally demonstrate that our proposed framework constructs a posterior distribution of the flow field that better approximates the real flow compared to the prior numerical solutions and purely data-driven methods. },

 abstract = {In this paper, we address a safety-critical control problem using reachability analysis and design a reinforcement learning-based mechanism for learning online and in fixed-time the solution to the safety-critical control problem. Safety is assured by determining a set of states for which there does not exist an admissible control law generating a system trajectory reaching a set of forbidden states at a user-prescribed time instant. Specifically, we cast our safety-critical problem as a  Mayer optimal feedback control problem whose solution satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation and characterizes the set of safe states. Since the HJB equation is generally difficult to solve, we develop an online critic-only reinforcement learning-based algorithm for simultaneously learning the solution to the HJB equation and the safe set in fixed time. In particular, we introduce a non-Lipschitz experience replay-based learning law utilizing recorded and current data for updating the critic weights to learn the value function and the safe set. The non-Lipschitz property of the dynamics gives rise to fixed-time convergence, whereas the experience replay-based approach eliminates the need of satisfying the persistence of excitation condition provided that the recorded data is sufficiently rich. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach. },

We instead propose a new "transition occupancy matching" (TOM) objective for MBRL model learning: a model is good to the extent that the current policy experiences the same distribution of transitions inside the model as in the real environment. We derive TOM directly from a novel lower bound on the standard reinforcement learning objective. To optimize TOM, we show how to reduce it to a form of importance weighted maximum-likelihood estimation, where the automatically computed importance weights identify policy-relevant past experiences from a replay buffer, enabling stable optimization. TOM thus offers a plug-and-play model learning sub-routine that is compatible with any backbone MBRL algorithm. On various Mujoco continuous robotic control tasks, we show that TOM successfully focuses model learning on policy-relevant experience and drives policies faster to higher task rewards than alternative model learning approaches.},

 abstract = {Hybrid systems are prevalent in robotics. However, ensuring the stability of hybrid systems is challenging due to sophisticated continuous and discrete dynamics. A system with all its system modes stable can still be unstable. Hence special treatments are required at mode switchings to stabilize the system. In this work, we propose a hierarchical, neural network (NN)-based method to control general hybrid systems. For each system mode, we first learn an NN Lyapunov function and an NN controller to ensure the states within the region of attraction (RoA) can be stabilized. Then an RoA NN estimator is learned across different modes. Upon mode switching, we propose a differentiable planner to ensure the states after switching can land in next mode's RoA, hence stabilizing the hybrid system. We provide novel theoretical stability guarantees and conduct experiments in car tracking control, pogobot navigation, and bipedal walker locomotion. Our method only requires 0.25X of the training time as needed by other learning-based methods. With low running time (10-50X faster than model predictive control (MPC)), our controller achieves a higher stability/success rate over other baselines such as MPC, reinforcement learning (RL), common Lyapunov methods (CLF), linear quadratic regulator (LQR), quadratic programming (QP) and Hamilton-Jacobian-based methods (HJB).

In particular, for tuneable KKL observers, the relationship between the design of the observer and its trade-off between convergence speed and robustness is analysed and used as a basis for improving the robustness of the learning-based observer in training.

@inproceedings{pmlr-v211-mitra23a,
 abstract = {One of the primary challenges in large-scale distributed learning stems from stringent communication constraints. While several recent works address this challenge for static optimization problems, sequential decision-making under uncertainty has remained much less explored in this regard. Motivated by this gap, we introduce a new linear stochastic bandit formulation over a bit-constrained channel. Specifically, in our setup, an agent interacting with an environment transmits encoded estimates of an unknown model parameter to a server over a communication channel of finite capacity. The goal of the server is to take actions based on these estimates to minimize cumulative regret. To this end, we develop a novel and general algorithmic framework that hinges on two main components: (i) an adaptive encoding mechanism that exploits statistical concentration bounds, and (ii) a decision-making principle based on confidence sets that account for encoding errors. As our main result, we prove that when the unknown model is $d$-dimensional, a channel capacity of $O(d)$ bits suffices to achieve order-optimal regret. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, we then show that the same result continues to hold for non-linear observation models satisfying standard regularity conditions. Finally, we establish that for the simpler unstructured multi-armed bandit problem, $1$ bit channel-capacity is sufficient for achieving optimal regret bounds. Overall, our work takes a significant first step towards paving the way for statistical decision-making over finite-capacity channels.},

The convergence of MPI has been well studied in the context of discounted and average-cost MDPs. In this work, we consider the exponential cost risk-sensitive MDP formulation, which is known to provide some robustness to model parameters. Although policy iteration and value iteration have been well studied in the context of risk sensitive MDPs, MPI is unexplored. We provide the first proof that MPI also converges for the risk-sensitive problem in the case of finite state and action spaces. Since the exponential cost formulation deals with the multiplicative Bellman equation, our main contribution is a convergence proof which is quite different than existing results for discounted and risk-neutral average-cost problems as well as risk sensitive value and policy iteration approaches. We conclude our analysis with simulation results, assessing MPI's performance relative to alternative dynamic programming methods like value iteration and policy iteration across diverse problem parameters. Our findings highlight risk-sensitive MPI's enhanced computational efficiency compared to both value and policy iteration techniques.},

While this problem has been studied when the players have fixed but unknown preferences, in this work we study the problem of how to learn when the preferences of the players are time varying and unknown. Our contribution is a methodology that can handle any type of preference structure and variation scenario. We show that, with the proposed algorithm, each player receives a uniform sub-linear regret of {$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(L^{1/2}_TT^{1/2})$} up to the number of changes in the underlying preferences of the agents, $L_T$. Therefore, we show that the optimal rates for single-agent learning can be achieved in spite of the competition up to a difference of a constant factor. We also discuss extensions of this algorithm to the case where the number of changes need not be known a priori.},

 abstract = {Via operator theoretic methods, we formalize the concentration phenomenon for a given observable `$r$' of a discrete time Markov chain with `$\mu_{\pi}$' as invariant ergodic measure, possibly having support on an unbounded state space. The main contribution of this paper is circumventing tedious probabilistic methods with a study of a composition of the Markov transition operator $P$ followed by a multiplication operator defined by $e^{r}$. It turns out that even if the observable/ reward function is unbounded, but for some for some $q>2$, $\|e^{r}\|_{q \rightarrow 2} \propto \exp\big(\mu_{\pi}(r) +\frac{2q}{q-2}\big) $ and $P$ is hyperbounded with norm control $\|P\|_{2 \rightarrow q }< e^{\frac{1}{2}[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{q}]}$, sharp non-asymptotic concentration bounds follow. \emph{Transport-entropy} inequality ensures the aforementioned upper bound on multiplication operator for all $q>2$. The role of \emph{reversibility} in concentration phenomenon is demystified. These results are particularly useful for the reinforcement learning and controls communities as they allow for concentration inequalities w.r.t standard unbounded obersvables/reward functions where exact knowledge of the system is not available, let alone the reversibility of stationary measure.},

 abstract = {Many dynamical systems -- from robots interacting with their surroundings to large-scale multiphysics systems -- involve a number of interacting subsystems. Toward the objective of learning composite models of such systems from data, we present i) a framework for compositional neural networks, ii) algorithms to train these models, iii) a method to compose the learned models, iv) theoretical results that bound the error of the resulting composite models, and v) a method to learn the composition itself, when it is not known a priori. The end result is a modular approach to learning: neural network submodels are trained on trajectory data generated by relatively simple subsystems, and the dynamics of more complex composite systems are then predicted without requiring additional data generated by the composite systems themselves. We achieve this compositionality by representing the system of interest, as well as each of its subsystems, as a port-Hamiltonian neural network (PHNN) -- a class of neural ordinary differential equations that uses the port-Hamiltonian systems formulation as inductive bias. We compose collections of PHNNs by using the system's physics-informed interconnection structure, which may be known a priori, or may itself be learned from data. We demonstrate the novel capabilities of the proposed framework through numerical examples involving interacting spring-mass-damper systems. Models of these systems, which include nonlinear energy dissipation and control inputs, are learned independently. Accurate compositions are learned using an amount of training data that is negligible in comparison with that required to train a new model from scratch. Finally, we observe that the composite PHNNs enjoy properties of port-Hamiltonian systems, such as cyclo-passivity -- a property that is useful for control purposes.},

In particular, by using supervised Imitation Learning as an initial phase, a semi-realistic filter model with 13 tuning screws is tuned, fulfilling both insertion loss and return loss requirements. On this problem, this algorithm has a greater efficiency than any previously published results on Reinforcement Learning for Cavity filter tuning.},

The scheme relies on the recursive solution of a suitable data-driven reformulation of a stochastic Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which allows for forward prediction and optimization of statistical distributions of inputs and outputs. Our approach avoids the use of parametric system models. Instead it is based on previously recorded data using a recently proposed stochastic variant of Willems' fundamental lemma. The stochastic variant of the lemma is applicable to a large class of linear dynamics subject to stochastic disturbances of Gaussian and non-Gaussian nature. To ensure recursive feasibility, the initial condition of the OCP -- which consists of information about past inputs and outputs -- is considered as an extra decision variable of the OCP. We provide sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility and closed-loop practical stability of the proposed scheme as well as performance bounds. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the efficacy and closed-loop properties of the proposed scheme.},

Specifically, we interpret a (deep) feedforward neural network as a discrete dynamical system over a finite horizon that shapes distributions of initial states, and use characteristic functions to propagate the distribution of the input data through the network. Using the inverse Fourier transform, we obtain the corresponding cumulative distribution function of the output set, which can be used to check if the network is performing as expected given any random point from the input set.

One approach to improve the sample efficiency is model-based RL. In our model-based RL algorithm, we learn a model of the environment, essentially its transition dynamics and reward function, use it to generate imaginary trajectories and backpropagate through them to update the policy, exploiting the differentiability of the model. Intuitively, learning more accurate models should lead to better model-based RL performance. Recently, there has been growing interest in developing better deep neural network based dynamics models for physical systems, by utilizing the structure of the underlying physics. We focus on robotic systems undergoing rigid body motion without contacts. We compare two versions of our model-based RL algorithm, one which uses a standard deep neural network based dynamics model and the other which uses a much more accurate, physics-informed neural network based dynamics model. We show that, in model-based RL, model accuracy mainly matters in environments that are sensitive to initial conditions, where numerical errors accumulate fast. In these environments, the physics-informed version of our algorithm achieves significantly better average-return and sample efficiency. In environments that are not sensitive to initial conditions, both versions of our algorithm achieve similar average-return, while the physics-informed version achieves better sample efficiency. We also show that, in challenging environments, physics-informed model-based RL achieves better average-return than state-of-the-art model-free RL algorithms such as Soft Actor-Critic, as it computes the policy-gradient analytically, while the latter estimates it through sampling.},

Recent developments in model-free policy optimization for Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control have highlighted the importance of this question. In this paper, we first propose a new set of sufficient conditions ensuring that a perturbed controller remains internally stabilizing. Based on this result, we illustrate how to perform order reduction of general non-observer based controllers using balanced truncation and modal truncation. We also provide explicit bounds on the LQG performance of the reduced-order controller. Furthermore, for single-input-single-output (SISO) systems, we introduce a new controller reduction technique by truncating unstable modes. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical simulations. Our results will serve as valuable tools to design direct policy search algorithms for control problems with partial observations.},

Since most data-driven control algorithms make use of the least-squares estimator, we study how poisoning impacts the least-squares estimate through the lens of statistical testing, and question in what way data poisoning attacks can be detected. We establish under which conditions the set of models compatible with the data includes the true model of the system, and we analyze different poisoning strategies for the attacker. On the basis of the arguments hereby presented, we propose a stealthy data poisoning attack on the least-squares estimator that can escape classical statistical tests, and conclude by showing the efficiency of the proposed attack.},

 abstract = {This paper addresses the end-to-end sample complexity bound for learning in closed loop the state estimator-based robust H2 controller for an unknown (possibly unstable) Linear Time Invariant (LTI) system, when given a fixed state-feedback gain. We build on the results from Ding et al. (1994) to bridge the gap between the parameterization of all state-estimators and the celebrated Youla parameterization. Refitting the expression of the relevant closed loop allows for the optimal linear observer problem given a fixed state feedback gain to be recast as a convex problem in the Youla parameter. The robust synthesis procedure is performed by considering bounded additive model uncertainty on the coprime factors of the plant, such that a min-max optimization problem is formulated for the robust H2 controller via an observer approach. The closed-loop identification scheme follows Zhang et al. (2021), where the nominal model of the true plant is identified by constructing a Hankel-like matrix from a single time-series of noisy, finite length input-output data by using the ordinary least squares algorithm from Sarkar et al. (2020). Finally, a Hâ bound on the estimated model error is provided, as the robust synthesis procedure requires bounded additive uncertainty on the coprime factors of the model.

 abstract = {First-order methods are widely used to solve convex quadratic programs (QPs) in real-time applications because of their low per-iteration cost. However, they can suffer from slow convergence to accurate solutions. In this paper, we present a framework which learns an effective warm-start for a popular first-order method in real-time applications, Douglas-Rachford (DR) splitting, across a family of parametric QPs. This framework consists of two modules: a feedforward neural network block, which takes as input the parameters of the QP and outputs a warm-start, and a block which performs a fixed number of iterations of DR splitting from this warm-start and outputs a candidate solution. A key feature of our framework is its ability to do end-to-end learning as we differentiate through the DR iterations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our method, we provide generalization bounds (based on Rademacher complexity) that improve with the number of training problems and number of iterations simultaneously. We further apply our method to three real-time applications and observe that, by learning good warm-starts, we are able to significantly reduce the number of iterations required to obtain high-quality solutions.},

 abstract = {Deep neural networks have emerged as the workhorse for a large section of robotics and control applications, especially as models for dynamical systems. Such data-driven models are in turn used for designing and verifying autonomous systems. They are particularly useful in modeling medical systems where data can be leveraged to individualize treatment. In safety-critical applications, it is important that the data-driven model is conformant to established knowledge from the natural sciences. Such knowledge is often available or can often be distilled into a (possibly black-box) model. For instance, an F1 racing car should conform to Newton's laws (which are encoded within a unicycle model). In this light, we consider the following problem - given a model $M$ and a state transition dataset, we wish to best approximate the system model while being a bounded distance away from $M$. We propose a method to guarantee this conformance. Our first step is to distill the dataset into a few representative samples called memories, using the idea of a growing neural gas. Next, using these memories we partition the state space into disjoint subsets and compute bounds that should be respected by the neural network in each subset. This serves as a symbolic wrapper for guaranteed conformance. We argue theoretically that this only leads to a bounded increase in approximation error; which can be controlled by increasing the number of memories. We experimentally show that on three case studies (Car Model, Drones, and Artificial Pancreas), our constrained neurosymbolic models conform to specified models (each encoding various constraints) with order-of-magnitude improvements compared to the augmented Lagrangian and vanilla training methods.

While most existing works focus on deterministic prediction, producing probabilistic forecasts to quantify uncertainty and assess risks is critical for downstream decision-making tasks such as motion planning and collision avoidance. Multi-agent dynamics often contains internal symmetry. By leveraging symmetry, specifically rotation equivariance, we can improve not only the prediction accuracy but also uncertainty calibration. We introduce Energy Score, a proper scoring rule, to evaluate probabilistic predictions. We propose a novel deep dynamics model, Probabilistic Equivariant Continuous COnvolution (PECCO) for probabilistic prediction of multi-agent trajectories. PECCO extends equivariant continuous convolution to model the joint velocity distribution of multiple agents. It uses dynamics integration to propagate the uncertainty from velocity to position.

Most C-MARL algorithms use a primal-dual approach to enforce constraints through a penalty function added to the reward. In this paper, we study the structural effects of this penalty term on the MARL problem. First, we show that the standard practice of using the constraint function as the penalty leads to a weak notion of safety. However, by making simple modifications to the penalty term, we can enforce meaningful probabilistic (chance and conditional value at risk) constraints. Second, we quantify the effect of the penalty term on the value function, uncovering an improved value estimation procedure. We use these insights to propose a constrained multiagent advantage actor critic (C-MAA2C) algorithm. Simulations in a simple constrained multiagent environment affirm that our reinterpretation of the primal-dual method in terms of probabilistic constraints is effective, and that our proposed value estimate accelerates convergence to a safe joint policy.},

 abstract = {Trajectory prediction is an integral component of modern autonomous systems as it allows for envisioning future intentions of nearby moving agents. Due to the lack of other agents' dynamics and control policies, deep neural network (DNN) models are often employed for trajectory forecasting tasks. Although there exists an extensive literature on improving the accuracy of these models, there is a very limited number of works studying their robustness against adversarially crafted input trajectories. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a targeted adversarial attack against DNN models for trajectory forecasting tasks. We call the proposed attack TA4TP for Targeted adversarial Attack for Trajectory Prediction. Our approach generates adversarial input trajectories that are capable of fooling DNN models into predicting user-specified target/desired trajectories. Our attack relies on solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem where the objective function captures the deviation of the predicted trajectory from a target one while the constraints model physical requirements that the adversarial input should satisfy. The latter ensures that the inputs look natural and they are safe to execute (e.g., they are close to nominal inputs and away from obstacles). We demonstrate the effectiveness of TA4TP on two state-of-the-art DNN models and two datasets. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first targeted adversarial attack against DNN models used for trajectory forecasting.},

Most trajectory generation methods for waypoint navigation of quadrotors, for example minimum snap/jerk and minimum-time, are structured as bi-level optimizations. The first level involves allocating time across all input waypoints and the second step is to minimize the snap/jerk of the trajectory under that time allocation. Such an optimization can be computationally expensive to solve. In our approach we treat trajectory generation as a supervised learning problem between a sequential set of inputs and outputs. We adapt a transformer model to learn the optimal time allocations for a given set of input waypoints, thus making it into a single step optimization. We demonstrate the performance of the transformer model by training it to predict the time allocations for a minimum snap trajectory generator. The trained transformer model is able to predict accurate time allocations with fewer data samples and smaller model size, compared to a feedforward network (FFN), demonstrating that it is able to model the sequential nature of the waypoint navigation problem.},

Examples of such representations include "infinitely wide" neural nets, where the underlying nonlinearity is given by the activation function of an individual neuron. In this paper, we bring this perspective to function representation by neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs). A neural SDE is an It\^o diffusion process whose drift and diffusion matrix are elements of some parametric families. We show that the ability of a neural SDE to realize nonlinear functions of its initial condition can be related to the problem of optimally steering a certain deterministic dynamical system between two given points in finite time. This auxiliary system is obtained by formally replacing the Brownian motion in the SDE by a deterministic control input. We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimum control effort needed to accomplish this steering; these bounds may be of independent interest in the context of motion planning and deterministic optimal control.},

 abstract = {In this work, we consider the problem of learning a feed-forward neural network (NN) controller to safely steer an arbitrarily shaped planar robot in a compact and obstacle-occluded workspace. Unlike existing methods that depend strongly on the density of data points close to the boundary of the safe state space to train NN controllers with closed-loop safety guarantees, we propose an approach that lifts such assumptions on the data that are hard to satisfy in practice and instead allows for graceful safety violations, i.e., of a bounded magnitude that can be spatially controlled. To do so, we employ reachability analysis methods to encapsulate safety constraints in the training process. Specifically, to obtain a computationally efficient over-approximation of the forward reachable set of the closed-loop system, we partition the robot's state space into cells and adaptively subdivide the cells that contain states which may escape the safe set under the trained control law. To do so, we first design appropriate under- and over-approximations of the robot's footprint to adaptively subdivide the configuration space into cells. Then, using the overlap between each cell's forward reachable set and the set of infeasible robot configurations as a measure for safety violations, we introduce penalty terms into the loss function that penalize this overlap in the training process. As a result, our method can learn a safe vector field for the closed-loop system and, at the same time, provide numerical worst-case bounds on safety violation over the whole configuration space, defined by the overlap between the over-approximation of the forward reachable set of the closed-loop system and the set of unsafe states. Moreover, it can control the tradeoff between computational complexity and tightness of these bounds. Finally, we provide a simulation study that verifies the efficacy of the proposed scheme.},

In this paper, we develop an efficient method to evaluate the probabilities of long-term risk and their gradients. The proposed method exploits the fact that long-term risk probability satisfies certain partial differential equations (PDEs), which characterize the neighboring relations between the probabilities, to integrate MC methods and physics-informed neural networks. We provide theoretical guarantees of the estimation error given certain choices of training configurations. Numerical results show the proposed method has better sample efficiency, generalizes well to unseen regions, and can adapt to systems with changing parameters. The proposed method can also accurately estimate the gradients of risk probabilities, which enables first- and second-order techniques on risk probabilities to be used for learning and control.},

At the same time, a main challenge in DRL is that policy evaluation in DRL typically relies on the representation of the return distribution, which needs to be carefully designed. In this paper, we address this challenge for a special class of DRL problems that rely on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for control, advocating for a new distributional approach to LQR, which we call \emph{distributional LQR}. Specifically, we provide a closed-form expression of the distribution of the random return which, remarkably, is applicable to all exogenous disturbances on the dynamics, as long as they are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). While the proposed exact return distribution consists of infinitely many random variables, we show that this distribution can be approximated by a finite number of random variables, and the associated approximation error can be analytically bounded under mild assumptions. Using the approximate return distribution, we propose a zeroth-order policy gradient algorithm for risk-averse LQR using the Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as a measure of risk. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate our theoretical results.},

 abstract = {In this work, we consider a time-varying stochastic saddle point problem in which the objective is revealed sequentially, and the data distribution depends on the decision variables. Problems of this type express the distributional dependence via a distributional map, and are known to have two distinct types of solutions--saddle points and equilibrium points. We demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, online primal-dual type algorithms are capable of tracking equilibrium points. In contrast, since computing closed-form gradient of the objective requires knowledge of the distributional map, we offer an online stochastic primal-dual algorithm for tracking equilibrium trajectories. We provide bounds in expectation and in high probability, with the latter leveraging a sub-Weibull model for the gradient error. We illustrate our results on an electric vehicle charging problem where responsiveness to prices follows a location-scale family based distributional map.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel model-based policy gradient algorithm for tracking dynamic targets using a mobile robot, equipped with an onboard sensor with limited field of view. The task is to obtain a continuous control policy for the mobile robot to collect sensor measurements that reduce uncertainty in the target states, measured by the target distribution entropy. We design a neural network control policy with the robot $SE(3)$ pose and the mean vector and information matrix of the joint target distribution as inputs and attention layers to handle variable numbers of targets. We also derive the gradient of the target entropy with respect to the network parameters explicitly, allowing efficient model-based policy gradient optimization.},

 abstract = {Jumping is essential for legged robots to traverse through difficult terrains. In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework that combines optimal control and reinforcement learning to learn continuous jumping motions for quadrupedal robots. The core of our framework is a stance controller, which combines a manually designed acceleration controller with a learned residual policy. As the acceleration controller warm starts policy for efficient training, the trained policy overcomes the limitation of the acceleration controller and improves the jumping stability. In addition, a low-level whole-body controller converts the body pose command from the stance controller to motor commands. After training in simulation, our framework can be deployed directly to the real robot, and perform versatile, continuous jumping motions, including omni-directional jumps at up to 50cm high, 60cm forward, and jump-turning at up to 90 degrees.

@inproceedings{pmlr-v211-zhang23a,
 abstract = {Developing stable controllers for large-scale networked dynamical systems is crucial but has long been challenging due to two key obstacles: certifiability and scalability. In this paper, we present a general framework to solve these challenges using compositional neural certificates based on ISS (Input-to-State Stability) Lyapunov functions. Specifically, we treat a large networked dynamical system as an interconnection of smaller subsystems and develop methods that can find each subsystem a decentralized controller and an ISS Lyapunov function; the latter can be collectively composed to prove the global stability of the system. To ensure the scalability of our approach, we develop generalizable and robust ISS Lyapunov functions where a single function can be used across different subsystems and the certificates we produced for small systems can be generalized to be used on large systems with similar structures. We encode both ISS Lyapunov functions and controllers as neural networks and propose a novel training methodology to handle the logic in ISS Lyapunov conditions that encodes the interconnection with neighboring subsystems. We demonstrate our approach in systems including Platoon, Drone formation control, and Power systems. Experimental results show that our framework can reduce the tracking error up to 75% compared with RL algorithms when applied to large-scale networked systems.},

 abstract = {We study representation learning for efficient imitation learning over linear systems. In particular, we consider a setting where learning is split into two phases: (a) a pre-training step where a shared $k$-dimensional representation is learned from $H$ source policies, and (b) a target policy fine-tuning step where the learned representation is used to parameterize the policy class. We find that the imitation gap over trajectories generated by the learned target policy is bounded by $\tilde{O}\left( \frac{k n_x}{HN_{\mathrm{shared}}} + \frac{k n_u}{N_{\mathrm{target}}}\right)$, where $n_x > k$ is the state dimension, $n_u$ is the input dimension, $N_{\mathrm{shared}}$ denotes the total amount of data collected for each policy during representation learning, and $N_{\mathrm{target}}$ is the amount of target task data. This result formalizes the intuition that aggregating data across related tasks to learn a representation can significantly improve the sample efficiency of learning a target task. The trends suggested by this bound are corroborated in simulation.},

Based on the V-learning framework, this paper proposes MARL algorithms that efficiently deal with reward delays. When the delays are finite, our algorithm reaches a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) with rate $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{H^3\sqrt{S\mathcal{T}_K}}{K}+\frac{H^3\sqrt{SA}}{\sqrt{K}})$ where $K$ is the number of episodes, $H$ is the planning horizon, $S$ is the size of the state space, $A$ is the size of the largest action space, and $\mathcal{T}_K$ is the measure of total delay formally defined in the paper. Moreover, our algorithm is extended to cases with infinite delays through a reward skipping scheme. It achieves convergence rate similar to the finite delay case.},

In its core part, it is challenging to ensure RL agents persistently satisfy a hard state constraint without white-box or black-box dynamics models. This paper presents an integrated model learning and safe control framework to safeguard any agent, where its dynamics are learned as Gaussian processes. The proposed theory provides (i) a novel method to construct an offline dataset for model learning that best achieves safety requirements; (ii) a parameterization rule for safety index to ensure the existence of safe control; (iii) a safety guarantee in terms of probabilistic forward invariance when the model is learned using the aforementioned dataset. Simulation results show that our framework guarantees almost zero safety violation on various continuous control tasks.},

 abstract = {Differentiable simulation enables gradients to be back-propagated through physics simulations. In this way, one can learn the dynamics and properties of a physics system by gradient-based optimization or embed the whole differentiable simulation as a layer in a deep learning model for downstream tasks, such as planning and control. However, differentiable simulation at its current stage is not perfect and might provide wrong gradients that deteriorate its performance in learning tasks. In this paper, we study differentiable rigid-body simulation with contacts. We find that existing differentiable simulation methods provide inaccurate gradients when the contact normal direction is not fixed - a general situation when the contacts are between two moving objects. We propose to improve gradient computation by continuous collision detection and leverage the time-of-impact (TOI) to calculate the post-collision velocities. We demonstrate our proposed method, referred to as TOI-Velocity, on two optimal control problems. We show that with TOI-Velocity, we are able to learn an optimal control sequence that matches the analytical solution, while without TOI-Velocity, existing differentiable simulation methods fail to do so.},

 abstract = {The fundamental bottleneck of learning continuous-time point processes is integration. Due to the intrinsic mathematical difficulty of symbolic integration, neural point process (NPP) models either constrain the intensity function to a simple integrable kernel function or apply  numerical integration. However, the former has limited expressive power. The latter suffers additional numerical errors and high computational costs. In this paper, we introduce *Automatic Integration for Neural Point Process* models (Auto-NPP), a new paradigm for exact, efficient, non-parametric inference of point process. We validate our method on simulated events governed by temporal point processes and real-world events. We demonstrate that our method has clear advantages in recovering complex intensity functions from irregular time series. On real-world datasets with noise and unknown intensity functions, our method is also much faster than state-of-the-art NPP models with comparable prediction accuracy. },
