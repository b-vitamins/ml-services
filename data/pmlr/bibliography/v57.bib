We assume that the target tree transformation can be defined by a deterministic top-down tree transducer with regular domain inspection (DTOPi:reg). An RPNI style learning algorithm that solves this problem in polynomial time and with polynomially many examples was presented at Pods'2010, but restricted to the case of path-closed regular domains. In this paper, we show that this restriction can be removed. For this, we present a new normal form for DTOPi:reg by extending the Myhill-Nerode theorem for DTOP to regular domain inspections in a nontrivial manner. The RPNI style learning algorithm can also be lifted but becomes more involved too.},

We then present the results of some experiments that indicate that with randomly generated context-free grammars in Chomsky normal form, which generate infinite languages and are derivationally sparse, nearly all grammars have the finite kernel property, whereas the finite context property is much less common.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v57-fukunaga16,
 abstract = {Various grammar compression algorithms have been proposed in the last decade. A grammar compression is a restricted CFG deriving the string deterministically. An efficient grammar compression develops a smaller CFG by finding duplicated patterns and removing them. This process is just a frequent pattern discovery by grammatical inference. While we can get any frequent pattern in linear time using a preprocessed string, a huge working space is required for longer patterns, and the whole string must be loaded into the memory preliminarily. We propose an online algorithm approximating this problem within a compressed space. The main contribution is an improvement of the previously best known approximation ratio $Ω(\frac{1}{\lg^2m})$ to $Ω(\frac{1}{\lg^*N\lg m})$ where $m$ is the length of an optimal pattern in a string of length $N$ and $\lg^*$ is the iteration of the logarithm base $2$. For a sufficiently large $N$, $\lg^*N$ is practically constant. The experimental results show that our algorithm extracts nearly optimal patterns and achieves a significant improvement in memory consumption compared to the offline algorithm.},

CNPL logic represents an intermediate between conjunctions of negative literals (CNL) and a propositional-style logic, both of which have been well-studied in terms of the language classes they describe. Model-theoretic approaches to formal language theory have traditionally assumed that each position in a string belongs to exactly one unary relation. Using enriched models (which do no satisfy this assumption) presents a new avenue for investigation with potential applications in several fields including linguistics, planning and control, and molecular biology.
