 abstract = {We present a new optimization-theoretic approach to analyzing Follow-the-Leader style algorithms, particularly in the setting where perturbations are used as a tool for regularization. We show that adding a strongly convex penalty function to the decision rule and adding stochastic perturbations to data correspond to deterministic and stochastic smoothing operations, respectively. We establish an equivalence between “Follow the Regularized Leader” and “Follow the Perturbed Leader” up to the smoothness properties. This intuition leads to a new generic analysis framework that recovers and improves the previous known regret bounds of the class of algorithms commonly known as Follow the Perturbed Leader.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of learning sparsely used overcomplete dictionaries, where each observation is a sparse combination of elements from an unknown overcomplete dictionary. We establish exact recovery when the dictionary elements are mutually incoherent. Our method consists of a clustering-based initialization step, which provides an a pproximate estimate of the true dictionary with guaranteed accuracy. This estimate is then refined via a n iterative algorithm with the following alternating steps: 1) estimation of the dictionary coef ficients for each observation through `1 minimization, given the dictionary estimate, and 2) estimation of the dictionary elements through least squares, given the coefficient estimates. We establis h that, under a set of sufficient conditions, our method converges at a linear rate to the true dictionary as well as the true coefficients for each observation.},

It is desirable that the representatives selected by the quantization algorithm have the same distribution p as the original sample points. However, quantization algorithms based on Euclidean distance, such as k-means, do not have this property. We provide a solution to this problem that takes the unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph on the sample as input. In particular, it does not need to have access to the data points themselves. Our solution generates quantization centers that are “evenly spaced”. We exploit this property to downsample geometric graphs and show that our method produces sparse downsampled graphs. Our algorithm is easy to implement, and we provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-anderson14,
 abstract = {In this paper we show that very large mixtures of Gaussians are efficiently learnable in high dimension. More precisely, we prove that a mixture with known identical covariance matrices whose number of components is a polynomial of any fixed degree in the dimension n is polynomially learnable as long as a certain non-degeneracy condition on the means is satisfied. It turns out that this condition is generic in the sense of smoothed complexity, as soon as the dimensionality of the space is high enough. Moreover, we prove that no such condition can possibly exist in low dimension and the problem of learning the parameters is generically hard. In contrast, much of the existing work on Gaussian Mixtures relies on low-dimensional projections and thus hits an artificial barrier. Our main result on mixture recovery relies on a new “Poissonization”-based technique, which transforms a mixture of Gaussians to a linear map of a product distribution. The problem of learning this map can be efficiently solved using some recent results on tensor decompositions and Independent Component Analysis (ICA), thus giving an algorithm for recovering the mixture. In addition, we combine our low-dimensional hardness results for Gaussian mixtures with Poissonization to show how to embed difficult instances of low-dimensional Gaussian mixtures into the ICA setting, thus establishing exponential information-theoretic lower bounds for underdetermined ICA in low dimension. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such result in the literature. In addition to contributing to the problem of Gaussian mixture learning, we believe that this work is among the first steps toward better understanding the rare phenomenon of the “blessing of dimensionality” in the computational aspects of statistical inference.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-arora14,
 abstract = {In sparse recovery we are given a matrix $A$ (the dictionary) and a vector of the form $A X$ where $X$ is sparse, and the goal is to recover $X$. This is a central notion in signal processing, statistics and machine learning. But in applications such as sparse coding, edge detection, compression and super resolution, the dictionary $A$ is unknown and has to be learned from random examples of the form $Y = AX$ where $X$ is drawn from an appropriate distribution --- this is the dictionary learning problem. In most settings, $A$ is overcomplete: it has more columns than rows. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for learning overcomplete dictionaries; the only previously known algorithm with provable guarantees is the recent work of Spielman, Wang and Wright who gave an algorithm for the full-rank case, which is rarely the case in applications. Our algorithm applies to incoherent dictionaries which have been a central object of study since they were introduced in seminal work of Donoho and Huo. In particular, a dictionary is $μ$-incoherent if each pair of columns has inner product at most $μ/ \sqrt{n}$. The algorithm makes natural stochastic assumptions about the unknown sparse vector $X$, which can contain $k \leq c \min(\sqrt{n}/μ\log n, m^{1/2 -η})$ non-zero entries (for any $η&gt; 0$). This is close to the best $k$ allowable by the best sparse recovery algorithms even if one knows the dictionary $A$ exactly. Moreover, both the running time and sample complexity depend on $\log 1/ε$, where $ε$ is the target accuracy, and so our algorithms converge very quickly to the true dictionary. Our algorithm can also tolerate substantial amounts of noise provided it is incoherent with respect to the dictionary (e.g., Gaussian). In the noisy setting, our running time and sample complexity depend polynomially on $1/ε$, and this is necessary.},

 abstract = {With the emergence of Machine Learning tools that allow handling data with a huge number of features, it becomes reasonable to assume that, over the full set of features, the true labeling is (almost) fully determined. That is, the labeling function is deterministic, but not necessarily a member of some known hypothesis class. However, agnostic learning of deterministic labels has so far received little research attention. We investigate this setting and show that it displays a behavior that is quite different from that of the fundamental results of the common (PAC) learning setups. First, we show that the sample complexity of learning a binary hypothesis class (with respect to deterministic labeling functions) is not fully determined by the VC-dimension of the class. For any d, we present classes of VC-dimension d that are learnable from ~ O(d= )many samples and classes that require samples of size ( d= 2 ). Furthermore, we show that in this setup, there are classes for which any proper learner has suboptimal sample complexity. While the class can be learned with sample complexity ~ O(d= ), any proper (and therefore, any ERM) algorithm requires ( d= 2 ) samples. We provide combinatorial characterizations of both phenomena, and further analyze the utility of unlabeled samples in this setting. Lastly, we discuss the error rates of nearest neighbor algorithms under deterministic labels and additional niceness-of-data assumptions.},

 abstract = {We give a robust version of the celebrated result of Kruskal on the uniqueness of tensor decompositions: we prove that given a tensor whose decomposition satisfies a robust form of Kruskal's rank condition, it is possible to approximately recover the decomposition if the tensor is known up to a sufficiently small (inverse polynomial) error. Kruskal's theorem has found many applications in proving the identifiability of parameters for various latent variable models and mixture models such as Hidden Markov models, topic models etc. Our robust version immediately implies identifiability using only polynomially many samples in many of these settings. This polynomial identifiability is an essential first step towards efficient learning algorithms for these models. Recently, algorithms based on tensor decompositions have been used to estimate the parameters of various hidden variable models efficiently in special cases as long as they satisfy certain "non-degeneracy" properties. Our methods give a way to go beyond this non-degeneracy barrier, and establish polynomial identifiability of the parameters under much milder conditions. Given the importance of Kruskal's theorem in the tensor literature, we expect that this robust version will have several applications beyond the settings we explore in this work.},

 abstract = {Factor analysis is a basic tool in statistics and machine learning, where the goal is to take many variables and explain them away using fewer unobserved variables, called factors. It was introduced in a pioneering study by psychologist Charles Spearman, who used it to test his theory that there are fundamentally two types of intelligence – verbal and mathematical. This study has had a deep influence on modern psychology, to this day. However there is a serious mathematical limitation to this approach, which we describe next. In its most basic form, we are given a matrix M = ∑R i=1 ai ⊗ bi. Our goal is to recover the factors {ai}i and {bi}i. However this decomposition is only unique if we add further assumptions, such as requiring the factors {ai}i and {bi}i to be orthonormal. Otherwise we could apply an R×R rotation to the factors {ai}i and its transpose to {bi}i and recover another valid decomposition. This is often called the rotation problem and has been a central stumbling block for factor analysis since Spearman’s work. To summarize: Even if there is a factorization M = ∑R i=1 ai ⊗ bi that has a meaningful interpretation, there is no guarantee that factor analysis finds it!},

The method has a guaranteed coverage probability under the standard IID assumption regardless of whether the assumptions (often considerably more restrictive) of the underlying algorithm are satisfied. However, for the method to be really useful it is desirable that in the case where the assumptions of the underlying algorithm are satisfied, the conformal predictor loses little in efficiency as compared with the underlying algorithm (whereas being a conformal predictor, it has the stronger guarantee of validity). In this paper we explore the degree to which this additional requirement of efficiency is satisfied in the case of Bayesian ridge regression; we find that asymptotically conformal prediction sets differ little from ridge regression prediction intervals when the standard Bayesian assumptions are satisfied.},

Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of future tosses. The problem is closely related to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Our algorithm employs an optimal adaptive strategy—a strategy that performs the best possible action at each step after observing the outcomes of all previous coin tosses. Consequently, our algorithm is also optimal for any given starting history of outcomes. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem.

For example, we might try to infer the skills of the competitors in a tournament in order to predict who will win a match, or we might try to predict characteristics of users and films in order to predict which users will like which films. In even relatively simple settings of this type, it is typically NP-hard to find the latent data which best explain some observations. But do these complexity-theoretic obstructions actually prevent us from making good predictions? Because each prediction depends on only a small number of variables, it might be possible to make good predictions without actually finding a good global assignment. This may seem to be a purely technical distinction, but recent work has shown that several local prediction problems actually are easy even though the corresponding global inference problem is hard.

 abstract = {Many popular learning algorithms (E.g. Kernel SVM, logistic regression, Lasso, and Fourier-Transform based algorithms) operate by reducing the problem to a convex optimization problem over a set of functions. These methods offer the currently best approach to several central problems such as learning halfspaces and learning DNF’s. In addition they are widely used in numerous application domains. Despite their importance, there are still very few proof techniques to show limits on the power of these algorithms. We study the performance of this approach in the problem of (agnostically and improperly) learning halfspaces with margin γ. Let D be a distribution over labeled examples. The γ-margin error of a hyperplane h is the probability of an example to fall on the wrong side of h or at a distance ≤ γ from it. The γ-margin error of the best h is denoted Errγ(D). An α(γ)-approximation algorithm receives γ, as input and, using i.i.d. samples of D, outputs a classifier with error rate ≤ α(γ) Errγ(D) + . Such an algorithm is efficient if it uses poly( 1 γ , 1 ) samples and runs in time polynomial in the sample size. The best approximation ratio achievable by an efficient algorithm is O ( 1/γ √ log(1/γ) ) and is achieved using an algorithm from the above class. Our main result shows that the approximation ratio of every efficient algorithm from this family must be ≥ Ω ( 1/γ poly(log(1/γ)) ) , essentially matching the best known upper bound. © 2014 A.

We start by proving a surprising result: a generic optimal multiclass learner must be improper, namely, it must have the ability to output hypotheses which do not belong to the hypothesis class, even though it knows that all the labels are generated by some hypothesis from the class. In particular, no ERM learner is optimal. This brings back the fundamental question of \how to learn? We give a complete answer to this question by giving a new analysis of the one-inclusion multiclass learner of Rubinstein et al. (2006) showing that its sample complexity is essentially optimal. Then, we turn to study the popular hypothesis class of generalized linear classiers. We derive optimal learners that, unlike the one-inclusion algorithm, are computationally ecient. Furthermore, we show that the sample complexity of these learners is better than the sample complexity of the ERM rule, thus settling in negative an open question due to Collins (2005).},

A function c : 2 → R is a coverage function, if there exists a universe U with non-negative weights w(u) for each u ∈ U and subsets A1, A2, . . . , An of U such that c(S) = ∑ u∈∪i∈SAi w(u). Alternatively, coverage functions can be described as non-negative linear combinations of monotone disjunctions. They are a natural subclass of submodular functions and arise in a number of applications. We give an algorithm that for any γ, δ > 0, given random and uniform examples of an unknown coverage function c, finds a function h that approximates c within factor 1 + γ on all but δ-fraction of the points in time poly(n, 1/γ, 1/δ). This is the first fully-polynomial algorithm for learning an interesting class of functions in the demanding PMAC model of Balcan and Harvey (2012). Our algorithms are based on several new structural properties of coverage functions. Using the results in (Feldman and Kothari, 2014), we also show that coverage functions are learnable agnostically with excess `1-error over all product and symmetric distributions in time n . In contrast, we show that, without assumptions on the distribution, learning coverage functions is at least as hard as learning polynomial-size disjoint DNF formulas, a class of functions for which the best known algorithm runs in time 2 ) (Klivans and Servedio, 2004). As an application of our learning results, we give simple differentially-private algorithms for releasing monotone conjunction counting queries with low average error. In particular, for any k ≤ n, we obtain private release of k-way marginals with average error ᾱ in time n.},

 abstract = {In this work we analyze the sample complexity of classification by differentially private algorithms. Differential privacy is a strong and well-studied notion of privacy introduced by Dwork et al. [Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 3876, Springer, New York, 2006, pp. 265--284] that ensures that the output of an algorithm leaks little information about the data point provided by any of the participating individuals. Sample complexity of private probably approximately correct (PAC) and agnostic learning was studied in a number of prior works starting with Kasiviswanathan et al. [SIAM J. Comput., 40 (2011), pp. 793--826]. However, a number of basic questions remain open [A. Beimel, S. P. Kasiviswanathan, and K. Nissim, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 5978, Springer, New York, 2006, pp. 437--454; K. Chaudhuri and D. Hsu, Proceedings of Conference in Learning Theory, 2011, pp. 155--186; A. Beimel, K. Nissim, and U. Stemmer, Proceedings of the 4th Conference on Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science, 2013, pp. 97--110; A. Beimel, K. Nissim, and U. Stemmer, Proceedings of APPROX+RANDOM, 2013, pp. 363--378], most notably whether learning with privacy requires more samples than learning without privacy. We show that the sample complexity of learning with (pure) differential privacy can be arbitrarily higher than the sample complexity of learning without the privacy constraint or the sample complexity of learning with approximate differential privacy. Our second contribution and the main tool is an equivalence between the sample complexity of (pure) differentially private learning of a concept class $C$ ($\mathrm{SCDP}(C)$) and the randomized one-way communication complexity of the evaluation problem for concepts from $C$. Using this equivalence we prove the following bounds: (a) $\mathrm{SCDP}(C) = \Omega(\mathrm{LDim}(C))$, where $\mathrm{LDim}(C)$ is the Littlestone's dimension characterizing the number of mistakes in the online-mistake-bound learning model [N. Littlestone, Machine Learning, 2 (1987), pp. 285--318]. Known bounds on $\mathrm{LDim}(C)$ then imply that $\mathrm{SCDP}(C)$ can be much higher than the Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension of $C$. (b) For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that $\mathrm{LDim}(C)=2$ but $\mathrm{SCDP}(C) \geq t$. (c) For any $t$, there exists a class $C$ such that the sample complexity of (pure) $\alpha$-differentially private PAC learning is $\Omega(t/\alpha)$ but the sample complexity of the approximate $(\alpha,\beta)$-differentially private PAC learning is $O(\log(1/\beta)/\alpha)$. This resolves an open problem from Beimel, Nissim, and Stemmer [Proceedings of APPROX+RANDOM, 2013, pp. 363--378].},

Furtherf is r-sparse, that is it depends on at mostr out ofn variables. An attribute-efficient learning algorithm is an algorithm that can output a hypothesis close to f using a polynomial in r and logn number of examples (Blum, 1992). Despite a number of attempts and some partial progress, there are no efficient algorithms or hardness results for the problem. We propose a potentially easier question: what is the query complexity of this learning problem in the statistical query (SQ) model of Kearns (1998). We show that, as in the case of general PAC learning, the query complexity of attributeefficient SQ learning of any concept class can be characterized by a combinatorial parameter of the concept class. The proposed question is then equivalent to estimating the value of this parameter for the concept class of halfspaces. A potentially simpler problem is to estimate this parameter for the concept class of decision lists, a subclass of halfspaces.},

The SCs considered are bounded functions of a pair of decisions, and regret is augmented with the total SC. We show under general conditions that for any normed SC,σ(x,x ' ) = kx−xk, regret cannot be bounded given only a bound Q on the quadratic variation of losses. With an additional bound � on the total length of losses, we prove O( √ Q + �) regret for Regularized Follow the Leader (RFTL). Furthermore, an O( √ Q) bound holds for RFTL given a cost kx − xk 2 . By generalizing the Shrinking Dartboard algorithm, we also show an expected regret bound for the best expert setting with any SC, given bounds on the total loss of the best expert and the quadratic variation of any expert. As SCs vanish, all our bounds depend purely on quadratic variation. We apply our results to pricing options in an arbitrage-free market with proportional transaction costs. In particular, we upper bound the price of at the money call options, assuming bounds on the quadratic variation of a stock price and the minimum of summed gains and summed losses.},

However, the incoherence condition depends, in a nontrivial way, on the source (node) distribution of the cascades, which is typically unknown.

 abstract = {The Thompson Sampling (TS) policy is a widely implemented algorithm for the stochastic multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem. Given a prior distribution over possible parameter settings of the underlying reward distributions of the arms, at each time instant, the policy plays an arm with probability equal to the probability that this arm has largest mean reward conditioned on the current posterior distributions of the arms. This policy generalizes the celebrated “probability matching” heuristic which has been experimentally and widely observed in human decision making. However, despite its ubiquity, the Thompson Sampling policy is poorly understood. Our goal in this paper is to make progress towards understanding the empirical success of this policy. We proceed using the lens of approximation algorithms and problem definitions from stochastic optimization. We focus on an objective function termed stochastic regret that captures the expected number of times the policy plays an arm that is not the eventual best arm, where the expectation is over the prior distribution. Given such a definition, we show that TS is a 2‐ approximation to the optimal decision policy in two extreme but canonical scenarios. One such scenario is the two-armed bandit problem which is used as a calibration point in all bandit literature. The second scenario is stochastic optimization where the outcome of a random variable is revealed in a single play to a high or low deterministic value. We show that the 2 approximation is tight in both these scenarios. We provide an uniform analysis framework that in theory is capable of proving our conjecture that the TS policy is a 2‐approximation to the optimal decision policy for minimizing stochastic regret, for any prior distribution and any time horizon.},

 abstract = {Matrix Completion is the problem of recovering an unknown real-valued low-rank matrix from a subsample of its entries. Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary? It is well known that Matrix Completion in its full generality is NP-hard. However, little is known if make additional assumptions such as incoherence and permit the algorithm to output a matrix of slightly higher rank. In this paper we prove that Matrix Completion remains computationally intractable even if the unknown matrix has rank $4$ but we are allowed to output any constant rank matrix, and even if additionally we assume that the unknown matrix is incoherent and are shown $90%$ of the entries. This result relies on the conjectured hardness of the $4$-Coloring problem. We also consider the positive semidefinite Matrix Completion problem. Here we show a similar hardness result under the standard assumption that $\mathrm{P}\ne \mathrm{NP}.$ Our results greatly narrow the gap between existing feasibility results and computational lower bounds. In particular, we believe that our results give the first complexity-theoretic justification for why distributional assumptions are needed beyond the incoherence assumption in order to obtain positive results. On the technical side, we contribute several new ideas on how to encode hard combinatorial problems in low-rank optimization problems. We hope that these techniques will be helpful in further understanding the computational limits of Matrix Completion and related problems.},

The classic Perceptron boundedness theorem implies that such a result actually holds for a wide class of algorithms, although the factors suppressed by the O(1=t) notation are exponential in d.

 abstract = {We study the problem of learning a distribution from samples, when the underlying distribution is a mixture of product distributions over discrete domains. This problem is motivated by several practical applications such as crowd-sourcing, recommendation systems, and learning Boolean functions. The existing solutions either heavily rely on the fact that the number of components in the mixtures is finite or have sample/time complexity that is exponential in the number of components. In this paper, we introduce a polynomial time/sample complexity method for learning a mixture of r discrete product distributions over {1,2,...,l} n , for general l and r. We show that our approach is statistically consistent and further provide finite sample guarantees. We use techniques from the recent work on tensor decompositions for higher-order moment matching. A crucial step in these moment matching methods is to construct a certain matrix and a certain tensor with low-rank spectral decompositions. These tensors are typically estimated directly from the samples. The main challenge in learning mixtures of discrete product distributions is that these low-rank tensors cannot be obtained directly from the sample moments. Instead, we reduce the tensor estimation problem to: a) estimating a low-rank matrix using only off-diagonal block elements; and b) estimating a tensor using a small number of linear measurements. Leveraging on recent developments in matrix completion, we give an alternating minimization based method to estimate the low-rank matrix, and formulate the tensor completion problem as a least-squares problem.},

 abstract = {The paper proposes a novel upper confidence bound (UCB) procedure for identifying the arm with the largest mean in a multi-armed bandit game in the fixed confidence setting using a small number of total samples. The procedure cannot be improved in the sense that the number of samples required to identify the best arm is within a constant factor of a lower bound based on the law of the iterated logarithm (LIL). Inspired by the LIL, we construct our confidence bounds to explicitly account for the infinite time horizon of the algorithm. In addition, by using a novel stopping time for the algorithm we avoid a union bound over the arms that has been observed in other UCBtype algorithms. We prove that the algorithm is optimal up to constants and also show through simulations that it provides superior performance with respect to the state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {We study several questions in the reliable agnostic learning framework of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than others. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no false positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most $\epsilon$, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most $\epsilon$ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning, which considers partial classifiers that are allowed to predict unknown on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting unknown, and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. 
For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use point-wise polynomial approximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time.},

In the common variance case, we also provide a stopping rule that terminates faster than existing fixed-confidence algorithms.

 abstract = {In (KÃ©gl, 2014), we recently showed empirically that AdaBoost.MH is one of the best multi-class boosting algorithms when the classical one-against-all base classifiers, proposed in the seminal paper of Schapire and SingerÂ (1999), are replaced by factorized base classifiers containing a binary classifier and a vote (or code) vector. In a slightly different setup, a similar factorization coupled with an iterative optimization of the two factors also proved to be an excellent approach (Gao and Koller, 2011). The main algorithmic advantage of our approach over the original setup of Schapire and SingerÂ (1999) is that trees can be built in a straightforward way by using the binary classifier at inner nodes. In this open problem paper we take a step back to the basic setup of boosting generic multi-class factorized (Hamming) classifiers (so no trees), and state the classical problem of boosting-like convergence of the training error. Given a vote vector, training the classifier leads to a standard weighted binary classification problem. The main difficulty of proving the convergence is that, unlike in binary AdaBoost, the sum of the weights in this weighted binary classification problem is less than one, which means that the lower bound on the edge, coming from the weak learning condition, shrinks. To show the convergence, we need a (uniform) lower bound on the sum of the weights in this derived binary classification problem.},

For discrete Lipschitzbandits, we derive asymptotic problem specific lower bounds for the regret satisfied by anyalgorithm, and propose OSLB and CKL-UCB, two algorithms that efficiently exploit the Lipschitzstructure of the problem. In fact, we prove that OSLB is asymptotically optimal, as its asymptoticregret matches the lower bound. The regret analysis of our algorithms relies on a new concentrationinequality for weighted sums of KL divergences between the empirical distributions of rewards andtheir true distributions. For continuous Lipschitz bandits, we propose to first discretize the actionspace, and then apply OSLB or CKL-UCB, algorithms that provably exploit the structure efficiently.This approach is shown, through numerical experiments, to significantly outperform existing algorithmsthat directly deal with the continuous set of arms.

 abstract = {In the standard setting of approachability there are two players and a target set. The players play a repeated vector-valued game where one of them wants to have the average vector-valued payoff converge to the target set which the other player tries to exclude. We revisit the classical setting and consider the setting where the player has a preference relation between target sets: she wishes to approach the smallest (âbestâ) set possible given the observed average payoffs in hindsight. Moreover, as opposed to previous works on approachability, and in the spirit of online learning, we do not assume that there is a known game structure with actions for two players. Rather, the player receives an arbitrary vector-valued reward vector at every round. We show that it is impossible, in general, to approach the best target set in hindsight. We further propose a concrete strategy that approaches a non-trivial relaxation of the best-in-hindsight given the actual rewards. Our approach does not require projection onto a target set and amounts to switching between scalar regret minimization algorithms that are performed in episodes.},

 abstract = {A popular approach to solving multiclass learning problems is to reduce them to a set of binary classification problems through some output code matrix: the widely used one-vs-all and all-pairs methods, and the error-correcting output code methods of Dietterich and Bakiri (1995), can all be viewed as special cases of this approach. In this paper, we consider the question of statistical consistency of such methods. We focus on settings where the binary problems are solved by minimizing a binary surrogate loss, and derive general conditions on the binary surrogate loss under which the one-vs-all and all-pairs code matrices yield consistent algorithms with respect to the multiclass 0-1 loss. We then consider general multiclass learning problems defined by a general multiclass loss, and derive conditions on the output code matrix and binary surrogates under which the resulting algorithm is consistent with respect to the target multiclass loss. We also consider probabilistic code matrices, where one reduces a multiclass problem to a set of class probability labeled binary problems, and show that these can yield benefits in the sense of requiring a smaller number of binary problems to achieve overall consistency. Our analysis makes interesting connections with the theory of proper composite losses (Buja et al., 2005; Reid and Williamson, 2010); these play a role in constructing the right ‘decoding’ for converting the predictions on the binary problems to the final multiclass prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first work that comprehensively studies consistency properties of output code based methods for multiclass learning.},

 abstract = {This paper studies labeled sample compression for multi-label concept classes. For a specific extension of the notion of VC-dimension to multi-label classes, we prove that every maximum multilabel class of dimensiond has a sample compression scheme in which every sample is compressed to a subset of size at most d. We further show that every multi-label class of dimension 1 has a sample compression scheme using only sets of size at most 1. As opposed to the binary case, the latter result is not immediately implied by the former, since there are multi-label concept classes of dimension 1 that are not contained in maximum classes of dimension 1.},

 abstract = {Properties of distributions are real-valued functionals such as the mean, quantile or conditional value at risk. A property is elicitable if there exists a scoring function such that minimization of the associated risks recovers the property. We extend existing results to characterize the elicitability of properties in a general setting. We further relate elicitability to identifiability (a notion introduced by Osband) and provide a general formula describing all scoring functions for an elicitable property. Finally, we draw some connections to the theory of coherent risk measures.},

 abstract = {We show two novel concentration inequalities for suprema of empirical processes when sampling without replacement, which both take the variance of the functions into account. While these inequalities may potentially have broad applications in learning theory in general, we exemplify their significance by studying the transductive setting of learning theory. For which we provide the first excess risk bounds based on the localized complexity of the hypothesis class, which can yield fast rates of convergence also in the transductive learning setting. We give a preliminary analysis of the localized complexities for the prominent case of kernel classes.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-vanerven14,
 abstract = {We consider online prediction with expert advice. Over the course of many trials, the goal of the learning algorithm is to achieve small additional loss (i.e. regret) compared to the loss of the best from a set of K experts. The two most popular algorithms are Hedge/Weighted Majority and Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL). The latter algorithm first perturbs the loss of each expert by independent additive noise drawn from a fixed distribution, and then predicts with the expert of minimum perturbed loss (“the leader”) where ties are broken uniformly at random. To achieve the optimal worst-case regret as a function of the lossL of the best expert in hindsight, the two types of algorithms need to tune their learning rate or noise magnitude, respectively, as a function ofL . Instead of perturbing the losses of the experts with additive noise, we randomly set them to 0 or 1 before selecting the leader. We show that our perturbations are an instance of dropout — because experts may be interpreted as features — although for non-binary losses the dropout probability needs to be made dependent on the losses to get good regret bounds. We show that this simple, tuning-free version of the FPL algorithm achieves two feats: optimal worst-case O( p L lnK + lnK) regret as a function ofL , and optimalO(lnK) regret when the loss vectors are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution and there is a gap between the expected loss of the best expert and all others. A number of recent algorithms from the Hedge family (AdaHedge and FlipFlop) also achieve this, but they employ sophisticated tuning regimes. The dropout perturbation of the losses of the experts result in different noise distributions for each expert (because they depend on the expert’s total loss) and curiously enough no additional tuning is needed: the choice of dropout probability only affects the constants.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-warmuth14,
 abstract = {A number of online algorithms have been developed that have small additional loss (regret) compared to the best “shifting expert”. In this model, there is a set of experts and the comparator is the best partition of the trial sequence into a small number of segments, where the expert of smallest loss is chosen in each segment. The regret is typically defined for worst-case data / loss sequences. There has been a recent surge of interest in online algorithms that combine good worst-case guarantees with much improved performance on easy data. A practically relevant class of easy data is the case when the loss of each expert is iid and the best and second best experts have a gap between their mean loss. In the full information setting, the FlipFlop algorithm by De Rooij et al. (2014) combines the best of the iid optimal Follow-The-Leader (FL) and the worst-case-safe Hedge algorithms, whereas in the bandit information case SAO by Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) competes with the iid optimal UCB and the worst-case-safe EXP3. We ask the same question for the shifting expert problem. First, we ask what are the simple and efficient algorithms for the shifting experts problem when the loss sequence in each segment is iid with respect to a fixed but unknown distribution. Second, we ask how to efficiently unite the performance of such algorithms on easy data with worst-case robustness. A particular intriguing open problem is the case when the comparator shifts within a small subset of experts from a large set under the assumption that the losses in each segment are iid.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-williamson14,
 abstract = {Loss functions are central to machine learning because they are the means by which the quality of a prediction is evaluated. Any loss that is not proper, or can not be transformed to be proper via a link function is inadmissible. All admissible losses for n-class problems can be obtained in terms of a convex body in Rn. We show this explicitly and show how some existing results simplify when viewed from this perspective. This allows the development of a rich algebra of losses induced by binary operations on convex bodies (that return a convex body). Furthermore it allows us to define an “inverse loss” which provides a universal “substitution function” for the Aggregating Algorithm. In doing so we show a formal connection between proper losses and norms.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-xu14,
 abstract = {The classical setting of community detection consists of networks exhibiting a clustered structure. To more accurately model real systems we consider a class of networks (i) whose edges may carry labels and (ii) which may lack a clustered structure. Specifically we assume that nodes possess latent attributes drawn from a general compact space and edges between two nodes are randomly generated and labeled according to some unknown distribution as a function of their latent attributes. Our goal is then to infer the edge label distributions from a partially observed network. We propose a computationally efficient spectral algorithm and show it allows for asymptotically correct inference when the average node degree could be as low as logarithmic in the total number of nodes. Conversely, if the average node degree is below a specific constant threshold, we show that no algorithm can achieve better inference than guessing without using the observations. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that our model provides a general procedure to construct random graph models with a spectrum asymptotic to a pre-specified eigenvalue distribution such as a power-law distribution.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v35-yun14,
 abstract = {In this paper, we consider networks consisting of a finite number of non-overlapping communities. To extract these communities, the interaction between pairs of nodes may be sampled from a large available data set, which allows a given node pair to be sampled several times. When a node pair is sampled, the observed outcome is a binary random variable, equal to 1 if nodes interact and to 0 otherwise. The outcome is more likely to be positive if nodes belong to the same communities. For a given budget of node pair samples or observations, we wish to jointly design a sampling strategy (the sequence of sampled node pairs) and a clustering algorithm that recover the hidden communities with the highest possible accuracy. We consider both non-adaptive and adaptive sampling strategies, and for both classes of strategies, we derive fundamental performance limits satisfied by any sampling and clustering algorithm. In particular, we provide necessary conditions for the existence of algorithms recovering the communities accurately as the network size grows large. We also devise simple algorithms that accurately reconstruct the communities when this is at all possible, hence proving that the proposed necessary conditions for accurate community detection are also sufficient. The classical problem of community detection in the stochastic block model can be seen as a particular instance of the problems consider here. But our framework covers more general scenarios where the sequence of sampled node pairs can be designed in an adaptive manner. The paper provides new results for the stochastic block model, and extends the analysis to the case of adaptive sampling.},
