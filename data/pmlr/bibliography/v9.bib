However, it is difficult to learn the structure of a   belief network, particularly one with hidden units.  The Indian   buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on   the structure of a directed belief network with a single infinitely   wide hidden layer. Here, we introduce the cascading Indian   buffet process (CIBP), which provides a prior on the structure of a   layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and   width, yet allows tractable inference.  We use the CIBP prior with   the nonlinear Gaussian belief network framework to allow each unit   to vary its behavior between discrete and continuous   representations.  We use Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference in   this model and explore the structures learned on image data.}

In this paper, we utilize the framework of multitask learning to construct a BCI that can be used without any subject-specific calibration process. We discuss how this out-of-the-box BCI can be further improved in a computationally efficient manner as subject-specific data becomes available. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on two sets of experimental EEG data recorded during a standard two-class motor imagery paradigm from a total of 19 healthy subjects. Specifically, we show that satisfactory classification results can be achieved with zero training data, and combining prior recordings with subject-specific calibration data substantially outperforms using subject-specific data only. Our results further show that transfer between recordings under slightly different experimental setups is feasible.}

A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.}

In this paper, we present a formal connection between the optimization of composite likelihoods and the well-known contrastive divergence algorithm. In particular, we show that composite likelihoods can be stochastically optimized by performing a variant of contrastive divergence with random-scan blocked Gibbs sampling. By using higher-order composite likelihoods, our proposed learning framework makes it possible to trade off computation time for increased accuracy. Furthermore, one can choose composite likelihood blocks that match the modelâs dependence structure, making the optimization of higher-order composite likelihoods computationally efficient.  We empirically analyze the performance of blocked contrastive divergence on various models, including visible Boltzmann machines, conditional random fields, and exponential random graph models, and we demonstrate that using higher-order blocks improves both the accuracy of parameter estimates and the rate of convergence.}

The task is transductive as the set of items is fixed. Transductive representations (where the vector representation of each example is learned) allow the generation of highly nonlinear embeddings that capture object relationships without relying on a specific choice of features, and require only relatively simple optimization. Unfortunately, they have no direct out-of-sample extension. Inductive approaches on the other hand allow for the representation of unknown queries. We describe algorithms for this setting which have the advantages of both transductive and inductive approaches, and can be applied in unsupervised (either reconstruction-based or graph-based) and supervised ranking setups. We show empirically that our methods give strong performance on all three tasks.}

Partial Least Squares  stands out of well-known classical approaches as e.g. Ridge Regression or Principal Components Regression, as it is not defined as the solution of a global cost minimization procedure over a fixed model nor is it a linear estimator. Instead, approximate solutions are constructed by projections onto a nested set of data-dependent subspaces. To prove consistency, we exploit the known fact that Partial Least Squares is equivalent to the conjugate gradient algorithm in combination with early stopping. The choice of the stopping rule (number of iterations) is a crucial point. We study two empirical stopping rules. The first one monitors the estimation error in each iteration step of Partial Least Squares, and the second one estimates the empirical complexity in terms of a condition number. Both stopping rules lead to universally consistent estimators provided the kernel is universal.}

However, there remain graphical models where a direct causal effect can be identified and these graphical criteria all fail. As a result, we introduce a new set of graphical criteria which uses descendants of either the cause variable or the effect variable as âpath-specific instrumental variablesâ for the identification of the direct causal effect as long as certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions are based on edge removal and the existing graphical criteria of instrumental variables, and the identifiability of certain other total effects, and thus can be easily checked.}

This paper explores methods for converting DBNs with infinitesimal time steps into DBNs with finite time steps, to enable efficient simulation and filtering over long periods.  An exact conversionâsumming out all intervening time slices between two stepsâresults in a completely connected DBN, yet nearly all human-constructed DBNs are sparse.  We show how this sparsity arises from well-founded approximations resulting from differences among the natural time scales of the variables in the DBN. We define an automated procedure for constructing a provably accurate, approximate DBN model for any desired time step. We illustrate the method by generating a series of approximations to a simple pH model for the human body, demonstrating speedups of several orders of magnitude compared to the original model.}

In some cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates, where the Laplace approximation fails. Inspired by bounds on the marginal corrections, we arrive at factorized approximations, which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and Laplace.

It is clear that the success of learning under such circumstances depends on similarities between the two data distributions. We study assumptions about the relationship between the two distributions that one needed for domain adaptation learning to succeed.  We analyze the assumptions in an agnostic PAC-style learning model for a the setting in which the learner can access a labeled training data sample and an unlabeled sample generated by the test data distribution. We focus on three assumptions: (i) Similarity between the unlabeled distributions, (ii) Existence of a classifier in the hypothesis class with low error on both training and testing distributions, and (iii) The covariate shift assumption. I.e., the assumption that the conditioned label distribution (for each data point) is the same for both the training and test distributions.  We show that without either assumption (i) or (ii), the combination of the remaining assumptions is not sufficient to guarantee successful learning. Our negative results hold with respect to any domain adaptation learning algorithm, as long as it does not have access to target labeled examples.  In particular, we provide formal proofs that the popular covariate shift assumption is rather weak and does not relieve the necessity of the other assumptions.  We also discuss the intuitively appealing paradigm of reweighing the labeled training sample according to the target unlabeled distribution. We show that, somewhat counter intuitively, that paradigm cannot be trusted in the following sense. There are DA tasks that are indistinguishable, as far as the input training data goes, but in which reweighing leads to significant improvement in one task, while causing dramatic deterioration of the learning success in the other.}

  abstract = 	 {We discuss multiclass-multilabel classification problems in which   the set of possible labels is extremely large. Most existing   multiclass-multilabel learning algorithms expect to observe a   reasonably large sample from each class, and fail if they receive   only a handful of examples with a given label. We propose and   analyze the following two-stage approach: first use an arbitrary   (perhaps heuristic) classification algorithm to construct an initial   classifier, then apply a simple but principled method to augment   this classifier by removing harmful labels from its output.  A   careful theoretical analysis allows us to justify our approach under   some reasonable conditions (such as label sparsity and power-law   distribution of label frequencies), even when the training set does   not provide a statistically accurate representation of most   classes. Surprisingly, our theoretical analysis continues to hold   even when the number of classes exceeds the sample size. We   demonstrate the merits of our approach on the ambitious task of   categorizing the entire web using the 1.5 million categories   defined on Wikipedia.}

However, we find that it often does a very poor job of rendering the diversity of modes captured by the trained model. We suspect that this hinders the advantage that could in principle be brought by training algorithms relying on Gibbs sampling for uncovering spurious modes, such as the Persistent Contrastive Divergence algorithm. To alleviate this problem, we explore the use of tempered Markov Chain Monte-Carlo for sampling in RBMs.  We find both through visualization of samples and measures of likelihood on a toy dataset that it helps both sampling and learning.}

By approximating an observed data matrix  as the product of two latent matrices,  matrix factorization can reveal hidden structures embedded in data. A common challenge to use matrix factorization is determining the dimensionality of the latent matrices from data. Indian Buffet Processes (IBPs) enable us to apply the nonparametric Bayesian machinery to address this challenge. However, it remains a difficult task to learn nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization models. In this paper, we propose a novel variational Bayesian method based on new equivalence classes of infinite matrices for learning these models. Furthermore, inspired by the success of nonnegative matrix factorization on many learning problems, we impose nonnegativity constraints on the latent matrices and mix variational inference with expectation propagation. This mixed inference method is unified in a power expectation propagation framework. Experimental results on image decomposition demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and the higher prediction accuracy of our methods compared to alternative Monte Carlo and variational inference methods for IBP models. We also apply the new methods to collaborative filtering and role mining and show the improved predictive performance over other matrix factorization methods.}

In this paper, we describe a new graphical approach for modelling the dependence structure of multivariate stationary time series that are affected by latent variables. To this end, we introduce dynamic maximal ancestral graphs (dMAGs), in which each time series is represented by a single vertex. For Gaussian processes, this approach leads to vector autoregressive models with errors that are not independent but correlated according to the dashed edges in the graph. We discuss identifiability of the parameters and show that these models can be viewed as graphical ARMA models that satisfy the Granger causality restrictions encoded by the associated dynamic maximal ancestral graph.}

Our results build on the work of   Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to   play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised   training.

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.}

  abstract = 	 {Preference elicitation (PE) is an important component of interactive decision support systems that aim to make optimal recommendations to users by actively querying their preferences.  In this paper, we outline five principles important for PE in real-world problems: (1) real-time, (2) multiattribute, (3) low cognitive load, (4) robust to noise, and (5) scalable.  In light of these requirements, we introduce an approximate PE framework based on TrueSkill for performing efficient closed-form Bayesian updates and query selection for a multiattribute utility belief state â a novel PE approach that naturally facilitates the efficient evaluation of value of information (VOI) heuristics for use in query selection strategies.  Our best VOI query strategy satisfies all five principles (in contrast to related work) and performs on par with the most accurate (and often computationally intensive) algorithms on experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets.}

The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity.  We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance.  In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.}

We consider a network classifier as a logistic regression where the variables define the nodes and the interaction effects define the edges.  From this definition we represent the problem as a factor graph of local exponential loss functions.  Using the factor graph representation it is possible to interpret the network classifier as an ensemble of individual node classifiers.  We then combine ideas from boosted learning with network optimization algorithms to define two novel algorithms, Boosted Expectation Propagation (BEP) and Boosted Message Passing (BMP).  These algorithms optimize the global network classifier performance by locally weighting each node classifier by the error of the surrounding network structure.  We compare the performance of BEP and BMP to logistic regression as well state of the art penalized logistic regression models on simulated grid structured networks.  The results show that using local boosting to optimize the performance of a network classifier increases classification performance and is especially powerful in cases when the whole network structure must be considered for accurate classification.}

Here, we present a generative model and a corresponding approximate message passing scheme for inference on the optimal, off-policy value of nodes in smooth AND/OR trees, given random roll-outs. The crucial insight is that the distribution of values in game trees is not completely arbitrary. We define a generative model of the on-policy values using a latent score for each state, representing the value under the random roll-out policy. Inference on the values under the optimal policy separates into an inductive, pre-data step and a deductive, post-data part. Both can be solved approximately with Expectation Propagation, allowing off-policy value inference for any node in the (exponentially big) tree in linear time.}

A joint probability distribution over queries of interest is estimated using maximum entropy regularization. The distribution resides in a convex hull of allowable candidate distributions which satisfy concentration inequalities that stem from the sampling assumptions. The method accurately estimates rating distributions on synthetic and real data and is competitive with low rank and parametric methods which make more aggressive assumptions about the problem.}

Cumulative distribution networks (CDNs) have recently been proposed as a class of graphical models for CDFs. One advantage of CDF models is the simplicity of representing multivariate heavy-tailed distributions. Examples of fields that can benefit from the use of graphical models for CDFs include climatology and epidemiology, where data may follow extreme value statistics and exhibit spatial correlations so that dependencies between model variables must be accounted for. The problem of learning from data in such settings may nevertheless consist of optimizing the log-likelihood function with respect to model parameters where we are required to optimize a log-PDF/PMF and not a log-CDF.   We present a message-passing algorithm called the gradient-derivative-product (GDP) algorithm that allows us to learn the model in terms of the log-likelihood function whereby messages correspond to local gradients of the likelihood with respect to model parameters.  We will demonstrate the GDP algorithm on real-world rainfall and H1N1 mortality data and we will show that CDNs provide a natural choice of parameterizations for the heavy-tailed multivariate distributions that arise in these problems.}

The data are simply drawn as individual disconnected points.  While making this assumption may seem absurd at first glance, many scientific modeling tasks have exactly this property.  Previous work proposed methods for learning linear, discrete time models under these assumptions by optimizing approximate likelihood functions.  In this paper, we extend those methods to nonlinear models using kernel methods.  We go on to propose a new approach to solving the problem that focuses on achieving temporal smoothness in the learned dynamics.  The result is a convex criterion that can be easily optimized and often outperforms the earlier methods.  We test these methods on several synthetic data sets including one generated from the Lorenz attractor.}

This structure learning problem can be viewed as an inference problem where the variables specify the choice of parents for each node in the graph. The key combinatorial difficulty arises from the global constraint that the graph structure has to be acyclic. We cast the structure learning problem as a linear program over the polytope defined by valid acyclic structures. In relaxing this problem, we maintain an outer bound approximation to the polytope and iteratively tighten it by searching over a new class of valid constraints. If an integral solution is found, it is guaranteed to be the optimal Bayesian network. When the relaxation is not tight, the fast dual algorithms we develop remain useful in combination with a branch and bound method. Empirical results suggest that the method is competitive or faster than alternative exact methods based on dynamic programming.}

We also provide formal evidence that the modified Bayesian information criterion (BIC) can be used to efficiently select the number of iterations in the S-OMP. Once the number of variables has been reduced to a manageable size, we show that a more computationally demanding procedure can be used to identify the relevant variables for each of the regression outputs. We further provide evidence on the benefit of variable selection using the regression outputs jointly, as opposed to performing variable selection for each output separately.

We tackle the UFLP using probabilistic inference in a graphical model - an approach that has received little attention in the past.  We show that the fixed points of max-product linear programming (MPLP), a convexified version of the max-product algorithm, can be used to construct a solution with a 3-approximation guarantee for metric UFLP instances.  In addition, we characterize some scenarios under which the MPLP solution is guaranteed to be globally optimal.  We evaluate the performance of both max-sum and MPLP empirically on metric and non-metric problems, demonstrating the advantages of the 3-approximation construction and algorithm applicability to non-metric instances.}

We propose an ODE-based homotopy method to follow this trajectory. By following the path, our algorithm is able to automatically discard irrelevant features and to automatically go back and forth to avoid local optima.

Abstractly, a contextual multi-armed bandit problem models a situation where, in a sequence of independent trials, an online algorithm chooses, based on a given context (side information), an action from a set of possible actions so as to maximize the total payoff of the chosen actions.  The payoff depends on both the action chosen and the context. In contrast, context-free multi-armed bandit problems, a focus of much previous research, model situations where no side information is available and the payoff depends only on the action chosen.  Our problem is motivated by sponsored web search, where the task is to display ads to a user of an Internet search engine based on her search query so as to maximize the click-through rate (CTR) of the ads displayed.  We cast this problem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem where queries and ads form metric spaces and the payoff function is Lipschitz with respect to both the metrics. For any $\epsilon > 0$ we present an algorithm with regret $O(T^{\frac{a+b+1}{a+b+2} + \epsilon})$ where $a, b$ are the covering dimensions of the query space and the ad space respectively. We prove a lower bound $\Omega(T^{\frac{\tilde{a}+\tilde{b}+1}{\tilde{a}+\tilde{b}+2} - \epsilon})$ for the regret of any algorithm where $\tilde{a}, \tilde{b}$ are packing dimensions of the query spaces and the ad space respectively.

To extend second-order methods to high-dimensional data, we develop low-rank approximations of the covariance structure.

In this paper we introduce a new Markov Chain transition operator that updates all the variables of a pairwise MRF in parallel by using auxiliary Gaussian variables. The proposed MCMC operator is extremely simple to implement and to parallelize. This is achieved by a formal equivalence result between arbitrary pairwise MRFs and a particular type of Restricted Boltzmann Machine.  This result also implies that the later can be learned in place of the former without any loss of modeling power, a possibility we explore in experiments.}

In this paper, we propose a framework for online, incremental sparsification with a fixed budget designed for large scale real-time model learning. The proposed approach combines a sparsification method based on an independency measure with a large scale database. In combination with an incremental learning approach such as sequential support vector regression, we obtain a regression method which is applicable in real-time online learning. It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression techniques.

We also outline the extension of the proposed strategy, and then of the MTM strategy, to Bayesian model selection, casting it in a Reversible Jump framework. The approach is illustrated by real examples.}

For practical use, the space requirement is the bottleneck, which motivates trading space against time. Here, previous results on finding an optimal network structure in less space are extended in two directions. First, we consider the problem of computing the posterior probability of a given arc set. Second, we operate with the general partial order framework and its specialization to bucket orders,  introduced recently for related permutation problems. The main technical contribution is the development of a fast algorithm for a novel zeta transform variant, which may be of independent interest.}

  abstract = 	 {Inferring the causal structure of a set of random variables from a finite sample of the joint distribution is an important problem in science. Recently, methods using additive noise models have been suggested to approach the case of continuous variables. In many situations, however, the variables of interest are discrete or even have only finitely many states. In this work we extend the notion of additive noise models to these cases. Whenever the joint distribution $\mathbf{P}^{(X,Y)}$ admits such a model in one direction, e.g. $Y = f(X)+N$, $N \perp \!\!\! \perp X$, it does not admit the reversed model  $X=g(Y)+\tilde{N}$, $\tilde{N} \perp \!\!\! \perp Y$ as long as the model is chosen in a generic way. Based on these deliberations we propose an efficient new algorithm that is able to distinguish between cause and effect for a finite sample of discrete variables. We show that this algorithm works both on synthetic and real data sets.}

We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer this number (depending on and limited by only the number of tasks). Furthermore, our approach is applicable when the underlying task parameter subspace is inherently sparse, drawing parallels with l1 regularization and LASSO-style models. We also propose an augmented model which can make use of (labeled, and additionally unlabeled if available) inputs to assist learning this subspace, leading to further improvements in the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both the proposed approaches, especially when the number of examples per task is small. Finally, we discuss an extension of the proposed framework where a nonparametric mixture of linear subspaces can be used to learn a manifold over the task parameters, and also deal with the issue of negative transfer from unrelated tasks.}

We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learnerâs policy is slowly modified from executing the expertâs policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.}

We show that using such a recognition model, followed by a combined top-down and bottom-up pass, it is possible to efficiently learn a good generative model of high-dimensional highly-structured sensory input. We show that the additional computations required by incorporating a top-down feedback plays a critical role in the performance of a DBM, both as a generative and discriminative model. Moreover, inference is only at most three times slower compared to the approximate inference in a Deep Belief Network (DBN), making large-scale learning of DBMâs practical.

  abstract = 	 {Existing approaches to multi-view learning are particularly effective when the views are either independent (i.e, multi-kernel approaches) or fully dependent (i.e., shared latent spaces). However, in real scenarios, these assumptions are almost never truly satisfied. Recently, two methods have attempted to tackle this problem by factorizing the information and learn separate latent spaces for modeling the shared (i.e., correlated) and private (i.e., independent) parts of the data. However, these approaches are very sensitive to parameters setting or initialization. In this paper we propose a robust approach to factorizing the latent space into shared and private spaces by introducing orthogonality constraints, which penalize redundant latent representations. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously learn the structure and dimensionality of the latent spaces by relying on a regularizer that encourages the latent space of each data stream to be low dimensional. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we apply it to two existing shared latent space models that assume full dependence of the views, the sGPLVM and the sKIE, and show that our constraints improve the performance of these models on the task of pose estimation from monocular images.}

  abstract = 	 {Concentration inequalities that incorporate variance information (such as Bernsteinâs or Bennettâs inequality) are often significantly tighter than counterparts (such as Hoeffdingâs inequality) that disregard variance. Nevertheless, many state of the art machine learning algorithms for classification problems like AdaBoost and support vector machines (SVMs) extensively use Hoeffdingâs inequalities to justify empirical risk minimization and its variants. This article proposes a novel boosting algorithm based on a recently introduced principleâsample variance penalizationâwhich is motivated from an empirical version of Bernsteinâs inequality.  This framework leads to an efficient algorithm that is as easy to implement as AdaBoost while producing a strict generalization. Experiments on a large number of datasets show significant performance gains over AdaBoost. This paper shows that sample variance penalization could be a viable alternative to empirical risk minimization.}

In this paper we relax their assumptions and prove a tighter finite-sample error bound for the case of Reduced-Rank HMMs, i.e., HMMs with low-rank transition matrices. Since rank-$k$ RR-HMMs are a larger class of models than $k$-state HMMs while being equally efficient to work with, this relaxation greatly increases the learning algorithmâs scope. In addition, we generalize the algorithm and bounds to models where multiple observations are needed to disambiguate state, and to models that emit multivariate real-valued observations. Finally we prove consistency for learning Predictive State Representations, an even larger class of models. Experiments on synthetic data and a toy video, as well as on difficult robot vision data, yield accurate models that compare favorably with alternatives in simulation quality and prediction accuracy.}

This is a challenging problem since weak distributed patterns can be invisible in per node statistics as well as a global network-wide aggregate. Most prior work considers situations in which the activation/non-activation of each node is statistically independent, but this is unrealistic in many problems.  In this paper, we consider structured patterns arising from statistical dependencies in the activation process.  Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a sparsifying transform that succinctly represents structured activation patterns that conform to a hierarchical dependency graph.  Second, we establish that the proposed transform facilitates detection of very weak activation patterns that cannot be detected with existing methods. Third, we show that the structure of the hierarchical dependency graph governing the activation process, and hence the network transform, can be learnt from very few (logarithmic in network size) independent snapshots of network activity.}

Here, I develop and apply a generative approach to network inference (RCweb) for the case when the network is sparse and the latent (not observed) variables affect the observed ones. From all possible factor analysis (FA) decompositions explaining the variance in the data, RCweb selects the FA decomposition that is consistent with a sparse underlying network. The sparsity constraint is imposed by a novel method that significantly outperforms (in terms of accuracy, robustness to noise, complexity scaling and computational efficiency) methods using $\ell 1$ norm relaxation such as K-SVD and $\ell 1$-based sparse principle component analysis (PCA). Results from simulated models demonstrate that RCweb recovers exactly the model structures for sparsity as low (as non-sparse) as 50% and with ratio of unobserved to observed variables as high as 2. RCweb is robust to noise, with gradual decrease in the parameter ranges as the noise level increases.}

We show that all these notions of universality are closely linked to the injective embedding of a certain class of Borel measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). By exploiting this relation between universality and the embedding of Borel measures into an RKHS, we establish the relation between universal and characteristic kernels. The latter have been proposed in the context of the RKHS embedding of probability measures, used in statistical applications like homogeneity testing, independence testing, etc.}

In this paper, we propose a novel method of conditional density estimation that is suitable for multi-dimensional continuous variables. The basic idea of the proposed method is to express the conditional density in terms of the density ratio and the ratio is directly estimated without going through density estimation.

We present efficient message update algorithms for the new HOPs, and we improve upon the efficiency of message updates for a general class of existing HOPs.

In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parametrized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured.   Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems.  We believe that Policy  Improvement with Path Integrals (PI$^2$) offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.}

However, supervised data needed to fit an aggregation model  is often difficult to obtain, especially if needed for multiple domains. Therefore, we propose a generative model for unsupervised aggregation which exploits the agreement signal to estimate the expertise of individual judges.  Due to the large output space size, this aggregation model cannot encode expertise of constituent judges with respect to every category for all problems. Consequently, we extend it by incorporating the notion of category types  to account for variability  of the judge expertise depending on the type.  The viability of our approach is demonstrated both on synthetic experiments and on a practical task of syntactic parser aggregation.}

  abstract = 	 {Assume a teacher provides examples one by one. An approximate incremental SVM computes a sequence of classifiers that are close to the true SVM solutions computed on the successive incremental training sets. We show that simple algorithms can satisfy an averaged accuracy criterion with a computational cost that scales as well as the best SVM algorithms with the number of examples. Finally, we exhibit some experiments highlighting the benefits of joining fast incremental optimization and curriculum and active learning (Schon and Cohn, 2000; Bordes et al., 2005; Bengio et al., 2009).}

We explore an alternative prior for nonparametric Bayesian clustering, the uniform process, for applications where the ârich-get-richerâ property is undesirable. We also explore the cost of this new process: partitions are no longer exchangeable with respect to the ordering of variables. We present new asymptotic and simulation-based results for the clustering characteristics of the uniform process and compare these with known results for the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes. Finally, we compare performance on a real document clustering task, demonstrating the practical advantage of the uniform process despite its lack of exchangeability over orderings.}

We present a general framework for online multi-class learning with partial feedback that adapts the potential-based gradient descent approaches (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006). The generality of the proposed framework is verified by the fact that Banditron (Kakade et al., 2008) is indeed a special case of our work if the potential function is set to be the squared $L_2$ norm of the weight vector. We propose an exponential gradient algorithm for online multi-class learning with partial feedback. Compared to the Banditron algorithm, the exponential gradient algorithm is advantageous in that its mistake bound is independent from the dimension of data, making it suitable for classifying high dimensional data. Our empirical study with four data sets show that the proposed algorithm for online learning with partial feedback is more effective than the Banditron algorithm.}

  abstract = 	 {In this paper a kernel-based online learning algorithm, which has both constant space and update time, is proposed. The approach is based on the popular online Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm. When used in conjunction with kernel function, the number of support vectors in PA grows without bounds when learning from noisy data streams. This implies unlimited memory and ever increasing model update and prediction time. To address this issue, the proposed budgeted PA algorithm maintains only a fixed number of support vectors. By introducing an additional constraint to the original PA optimization problem, a closed-form solution was derived for the support vector removal and model update. Using the hinge loss we developed several budgeted PA algorithms that can trade between accuracy and update cost. We also developed the ramp loss versions of both original and budgeted PA and showed that the resulting algorithms can be interpreted as the combination of active learning and hinge loss PA. All proposed algorithms were comprehensively tested on 7 benchmark data sets. The experiments showed that they are superior to the existing budgeted online algorithms. Even with modest budgets, the budgeted PA achieved very competitive accuracies to the non-budgeted PA and kernel perceptron algorithms.}

We formulate and develop structured prediction cascades: a sequence of increasingly complex models that progressively filter the space of possible outputs. We represent an exponentially large set of filtered outputs using max marginals and propose a novel convex loss function that balances filtering error with filtering efficiency. We provide generalization bounds for these loss functions and evaluate our approach on handwriting recognition and part-of-speech tagging. We find that the learned cascades are capable of reducing the complexity of inference by up to five orders of magnitude, enabling the use of models which incorporate higher order features and yield higher accuracy.}

A variety of such generalizations has been proposed for latent variable models based on the Dirichlet process. We address dependency on covariates in binary latent feature models, by introducing a dependent Indian buffet process. The model generates, for each value of the covariate, a binary random matrix with an unbounded number of columns.  Evolution of the binary matrices over the covariate set is controlled by a hierarchical Gaussian process model. The choice of covariance functions controls the dependence structure and exchangeability properties of the model. We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for  Bayesian inference, and provide experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results show that explicit modeling of dependencies significantly improves accuracy of predictions.}

That is, an annotator may not be consistently accurate (or inaccurate) across the task domain. The presented approach produces classification and annotator models that allow us to provide estimates of the true labels and annotator variable expertise. We provide an analysis of the proposed model under various scenarios and show experimentally that annotator expertise can indeed vary in real tasks and that the presented approach provides clear advantages over previously introduced multi-annotator methods, which only consider general annotator characteristics.}

In particular, by using a concentration inequality for infinitely divisible distributions, we first prove that the function of risk error is Lipschitz continuous with a high probability, and then by using a specific concentration inequality for Levy processes, we obtain the risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Levy processes without Gaussian components. Based on the resulted risk bounds, we analyze the factors that affect the convergence of the risk bounds and then prove the convergence.}

Among the multi-task learning methods proposed thus far, Bonilla et al.âs method provides a novel multi-task extension of Gaussian process (GP) by using a task covariance matrix to model the relationships between tasks. However, learning the task covariance matrix directly has both computational and representational drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian extension by modeling the task covariance matrix as a random matrix with an inverse-Wishart prior and integrating it out to achieve Bayesian model averaging. To make the computation feasible, we first give an alternative weight-space view of Bonilla et al.âs multi-task GP model and then integrate out the task covariance matrix in the model, leading to a multi-task generalized t process (MTGTP). For the likelihood, we use a generalized t noise model which, together with the generalized t process prior, brings about the robustness advantage as well as an analytical form for the marginal likelihood.  In order to specify the inverse-Wishart prior, we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to estimate the parameter matrix of the inverse-Wishart prior. Moreover, we investigate some theoretical properties of MTGTP, such as its asymptotic analysis and learning curve. Comparative experimental studies on two common multi-task learning applications show very promising results.}

Although this overcomplete representation could in principle suffer from severe overfitting problems, we are able to provide effective control over the model via a matrix-variate Dirichlet process prior on the regression matrices.
