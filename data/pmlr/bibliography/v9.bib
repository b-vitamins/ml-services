 abstract = {Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability distributions. However, learning the structure of a belief network, particularly one with hidden units, is difficult. The Indian buffet process has been used as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the directed structure of a belief network with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. In this paper, we introduce the cascading Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a nonparametric prior on the structure of a layered, directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief network so each unit can additionally vary its behavior between discrete and continuous representations. We provide Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference in these belief networks and explore the structures learned on several image data sets.},

 abstract = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are limited in their applicability in everyday settings by the current necessity to record subjectspecific calibration data prior to actual use of the BCI for communication. In this paper, we utilize the framework of multitask learning to construct a BCI that can be used without any subject-specific calibration process. We discuss how this out-of-the-box BCI can be further improved in a computationally efficient manner as subject-specific data becomes available. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated on two sets of experimental EEG data recorded during a standard two-class motor imagery paradigm from a total of 19 healthy subjects. Specifically, we show that satisfactory classification results can be achieved with zero training data, and combining prior recordings with subjectspecific calibration data substantially outperforms using subject-specific data only. Our results further show that transfer between recordings under slightly different experimental setups is feasible.},

 abstract = {Interest in multioutput kernel methods is increasing, whether under the guise of multitask learning, multisensor networks or structured output data. From the Gaussian process perspective a multioutput Mercer kernel is a covariance function over correlated output functions. One way of constructing such kernels is based on convolution processes (CP). A key problem for this approach is efficient inference. Alvarez and Lawrence recently presented a sparse approximation for CPs that enabled efficient inference. In this paper, we extend this work in two directions: we introduce the concept of variational inducing functions to handle potential non-smooth functions involved in the kernel CP construction and we consider an alternative approach to approximate inference based on variational methods, extending the work by Titsias (2009) to the multiple output case. We demonstrate our approaches on prediction of school marks, compiler performance and financial time series.},

 abstract = {Composite likelihood methods provide a wide spectrum of computationally efficient techniques for statistical tasks such as parameter estimation and model selection. In this paper, we present a formal connection between the optimization of composite likelihoods and the well-known contrastive divergence algorithm. In particular, we show that composite likelihoods can be stochastically optimized by performing a variant of contrastive divergence with random-scan blocked Gibbs sampling. By using higher-order composite likelihoods, our proposed learning framework makes it possible to trade off computation time for increased accuracy. Furthermore, one can choose composite likelihood blocks that match the model’s dependence structure, making the optimization of higher-order composite likelihoods computationally efficient. We empirically analyze the performance of blocked contrastive divergence on various models, including visible Boltzmann machines, conditional random fields, and exponential random graph models, and we demonstrate that using higher-order blocks improves both the accuracy of parameter estimates and the rate of convergence.},

 abstract = {We study the standard retrieval task of ranking a fixed set of items given a previously unseen query and pose it as the half transductive ranking problem. The task is transductive as the set of items is fixed. Transductive representations (where the vector representation of each example is learned) allow the generation of highly nonlinear embeddings that capture object relationships without relying on a specific choice of features, and require only relatively simple optimization. Unfortunately, they have no direct out-of-sample extension. Inductive approaches on the other hand allow for the representation of unknown queries. We describe algorithms for this setting which have the advantages of both transductive and inductive approaches, and can be applied in unsupervised (either reconstruction-based or graph-based) and supervised ranking setups. We show empirically that our methods give strong performance on all three tasks.},

 abstract = {We prove the statistical consistency of kernel Partial Least Squares Regression applied to a bounded regression learning problem on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Partial Least Squares stands out of well-known classical approaches as e.g. Ridge Regression or Principal Components Regression, as it is not defined as the solution of a global cost minimization procedure over a fixed model nor is it a linear estimator. Instead, approximate solutions are constructed by projections onto a nested set of data-dependent subspaces. To prove consistency, we exploit the known fact that Partial Least Squares is equivalent to the conjugate gradient algorithm in combination with early stopping. The choice of the stopping rule (number of iterations) is a crucial point. We study two empirical stopping rules. The first one monitors the estimation error in each iteration step of Partial Least Squares, and the second one estimates the empirical complexity in terms of a condition number. Both stopping rules lead to universally consistent estimators provided the kernel is universal.},

Previous methods of graphical identification of direct causal effects in linear SEMs include methods such as the single-door criterion, the instrumental variable and the IV-pair, and the accessory set. However, there remain graphical models where a direct causal effect can be identified and these graphical criteria all fail. As a result, we introduce a new set of graphical criteria which uses descendants of either the cause variable or the effect variable as “pathspecific instrumental variables” for the identification of the direct causal effect as long as certain conditions are satisfied. These conditions are based on edge removal and the existing graphical criteria of instrumental variables, and the identifiability of certain other total effects, and thus can be easily checked.},

 abstract = {Real stochastic processes operating in continuous time can be modeled by sets of stochastic dierential equations. On the other hand, several popular model families, including hidden Markov models and dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), use discrete time steps. This paper explores methods for converting DBNs with infinitesimal time steps into DBNs with finite time steps, to enable ecient simulation and filtering over long periods. An exact conversion—summing out all intervening time slices between two steps— results in a completely connected DBN, yet nearly all human-constructed DBNs are sparse. We show how this sparsity arises from well-founded approximations resulting from dierences among the natural time scales of the variables in the DBN. We define an automated procedure for constructing an approximate DBN model for any desired time step and prove error bounds for the approximation. We illustrate the method by generating a series of approximations to a simple pH model for the human body, demonstrating speedups of several orders of magnitude compared to the original model.},

In some cases, expectation propagation gives excellent estimates, where the Laplace approximation fails. Inspired by bounds on the marginal corrections, we arrive at factorized approximations, which can be applied on top of both expectation propagation and Laplace.

 abstract = {The domain adaptation problem in machine learning occurs when the test data generating distribution differs from the one that generates the training data. It is clear that the success of learning under such circumstances depends on similarities between the two data distributions. We study assumptions about the relationship between the two distributions that one needed for domain adaptation learning to succeed. We analyze the assumptions in an agnostic PAC-style learning model for a the setting in which the learner can access a labeled training data sample and an unlabeled sample generated by the test data distribution. We focus on three assumptions: (i) similarity between the unlabeled distributions, (ii) existence of a classifier in the hypothesis class with low error on both training and testing distributions, and (iii) the covariate shift assumption. I.e., the assumption that the conditioned label distribution (for each data point) is the same for both the training and test distributions. We show that without either assumption (i) or (ii), the combination of the remaining assumptions is not sufficient to guarantee successful learning. Our negative results hold with respect to any domain adaptation learning algorithm, as long as it does not have access to target labeled examples. In particular, we provide formal proofs that the popular covariate shift assumption is rather weak and does not relieve the necessity of the other assumptions.},

We propose and analyze the following two-stage approach: first use an arbitrary (perhaps heuristic) classification algorithm to construct an initial classifier, then apply a simple but principled method to augment this classifier by removing harmful labels from its output. A careful theoretical analysis allows us to justify our approach under some reasonable conditions (such as label sparsity and power-law distribution of class frequencies), even when the training set does not provide a statistically accurate representation of most classes. Surprisingly, our theoretical analysis continues to hold even when the number of classes exceeds the sample size.

The main contribution is the addition of a prior, conditioned on context, on the Markov order. The resulting construction uses a simple recursion and can be updated efficiently. This allows the model to make predictions using more complex contexts, as more data is acquired, if necessary. In addition, our model can be alternatively seen as a mixture of tree experts.

 abstract = {Many real-world applications can be modeled by matrix factorization. By approximating an observed data matrix as the product of two latent matrices, matrix factorization can reveal hidden structures embedded in data. A common challenge to use matrix factorization is determining the dimensionality of the latent matrices from data. Indian Buffet Processes (IBPs) enable us to apply the nonparametric Bayesian machinery to address this challenge. However, it remains a difficult task to learn nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization models. In this paper, we propose a novel variational Bayesian method based on new equivalence classes of infinite matrices for learning these models. Furthermore, inspired by the success of nonnegative matrix factorization on many learning problems, we impose nonnegativity constraints on the latent matrices and mix variational inference with expectation propagation. This mixed inference method is unified in a power expectation propagation framework. Experimental results on image decomposition demonstrate the superior computational efficiency and the higher prediction accuracy of our methods compared to alternative Monte Carlo and variational inference methods for IBP models. We also apply the new methods to collaborative filtering and role mining and show the improved predictive performance over other matrix factorization methods.

One major problem in the application of Granger causality for the identification of causal relationships is the possible presence of latent variables that affect the measured components and thus lead to so-called spurious causalities. In this paper, we describe a new graphical approach for modelling the dependence structure of multivariate stationary time series that are affected by latent variables. To this end, we introduce dynamic maximal ancestral graphs (dMAGs), in which each time series is represented by a single vertex. For Gaussian processes, this approach leads to vector autoregressive models with errors that are not independent but correlated according to the dashed edges in the graph. We discuss identifiability of the parameters and show that these models can be viewed as graphical ARMA models that satisfy the Granger causality restrictions encoded by the associated dynamic maximal ancestral graph.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v9-erkan10a,
 abstract = {The maximum entropy (MaxEnt) framework has been studied extensively in the supervised setting. Here, the goal is to find a distribution p that maximizes an entropy function while enforcing data constraints so that the expected values of some (pre-defined) features with respect to p match their empirical counterparts approximately. Using different entropy measures, different model spaces for p, and different approximation criteria for the data constraints, yields a family of discriminative supervised learning methods (e.g., logistic regression, conditional random fields, least squares and boosting) (Dudik & Schapire, 2006; Friedlander & Gupta, 2006; Altun & Smola, 2006). This framework is known as the generalized maximum entropy framework.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a promising field that has increasingly attracted attention in the last decade. SSL algorithms utilize unlabeled data along with labeled data so as to increase the accuracy and robustness of inference algorithms. However, most SSL algorithms to date have had trade-offs, e.g., in terms of scalability or applicability to multi-categorical data. 
In this thesis, we extend the generalized MaxEnt framework to develop a family of novel SSL algorithms using two different approaches: (1) Introducing Similarity Constraints We incorporate unlabeled data via modifications to the primal MaxEnt objective in terms of additional potential functions. A potential function stands for a closed proper convex function that can take the form of a constraint and/or a penalty representing our structural assumptions on the data geometry. Specifically, we impose similarity constraints as additional penalties based on the semi-supervised smoothness assumption , i.e., we restrict the MaxEnt problem such that similar samples have similar model outputs. The motivation is reminiscent of that of Laplacian SVM (Sindhwani et al., 2005) and manifold transductive neural networks (Karlen et al., 2008), however, instead of regularizing the loss function in the dual we integrate our constraints directly to the primal MaxEnt problem which has a more straight-forward and natural interpretation. (2) Augmenting Constraints on Model Features We incorporate unlabeled data to enhance the moment matching constraints of the generalized MaxEnt problem in the primal. We improve the estimates of the model and empirical expectations of the feature functions using our assumptions on the data geometry.
In particular, we derive the semi-supervised formulations for three specific instances of the generalized MaxEnt framework on conditional distributions, namely logistic regression and kernel logistic regression for multi-class problems, and conditional random fields for structured output prediction problems. A thorough empirical evaluation on standard data sets that are widely used in the literature demonstrates the validity and competitiveness of the proposed algorithms. In addition to these benchmark data sets, we apply our approach to two real-life problems, vision based robot grasping, and remote sensing image classification where the scarcity of the labeled training samples is the main bottleneck in the learning process. For the particular case of grasp learning, we also propose a combination of semi-supervised learning and active learning, another sub-field of machine learning that is focused on the scarcity of labeled samples, when the problem setup is suitable for incremental labeling.
To conclude, the novel SSL algorithms proposed in this thesis have numerous advantages over the existing semi-supervised algorithms as they yield convex, scalable, inherently multi-class loss functions that can be kernelized naturally.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v9-glorot10a,
 abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multilayer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future. We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1. Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence. 1 Deep Neural Networks Deep learning methods aim at learning feature hierarchies with features from higher levels of the hierarchy formed by the composition of lower level features. They include Appearing in Proceedings of the 13 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2010, Chia Laguna Resort, Sardinia, Italy. Volume 9 of JMLR: WC Weston et al., 2008). Much attention has recently been devoted to them (see (Bengio, 2009) for a review), because of their theoretical appeal, inspiration from biology and human cognition, and because of empirical success in vision (Ranzato et al., 2007; Larochelle et al., 2007; Vincent et al., 2008) and natural language processing (NLP) (Collobert & Weston, 2008; Mnih & Hinton, 2009). Theoretical results reviewed and discussed by Bengio (2009), suggest that in order to learn the kind of complicated functions that can represent high-level abstractions (e.g. in vision, language, and other AI-level tasks), one may need deep architectures. Most of the recent experimental results with deep architecture are obtained with models that can be turned into deep supervised neural networks, but with initialization or training schemes different from the classical feedforward neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986). Why are these new algorithms working so much better than the standard random initialization and gradient-based optimization of a supervised training criterion? Part of the answer may be found in recent analyses of the effect of unsupervised pretraining (Erhan et al., 2009), showing that it acts as a regularizer that initializes the parameters in a “better” basin of attraction of the optimization procedure, corresponding to an apparent local minimum associated with better generalization. But earlier work (Bengio et al., 2007) had shown that even a purely supervised but greedy layer-wise procedure would give better results. So here instead of focusing on what unsupervised pre-training or semi-supervised criteria bring to deep architectures, we focus on analyzing what may be going wrong with good old (but deep) multilayer neural networks. Our analysis is driven by investigative experiments to monitor activations (watching for saturation of hidden units) and gradients, across layers and across training iterations. We also evaluate the effects on these of choices of activation function (with the idea that it might affect saturation) and initialization procedure (since unsupervised pretraining is a particular form of initialization and it has a drastic impact).},

 abstract = {We present a new estimation principle for parameterized statistical models. The idea is to perform nonlinear logistic regression to discriminate between the observed data and some artificially generated noise, using the model log-density function in the regression nonlinearity. We show that this leads to a consistent (convergent) estimator of the parameters, and analyze the asymptotic variance. In particular, the method is shown to directly work for unnormalized models, i.e. models where the density function does not integrate to one. The normalization constant can be estimated just like any other parameter. For a tractable ICA model, we compare the method with other estimation methods that can be used to learn unnormalized models, including score matching, contrastive divergence, and maximum-likelihood where the normalization constant is estimated with importance sampling. Simulations show that noise-contrastive estimation offers the best trade-off between computational and statistical efficiency. The method is then applied to the modeling of natural images: We show that the method can successfully estimate a large-scale two-layer model and a Markov random field.},

 abstract = {In this paper we propose a new classification algorithm designed for application on complex networks motivated by algorithmic similarities between boosting learning and message passing.  We consider a network classifier as a logistic regression where the variables define the nodes and the interaction effects define the edges.  From this definition we represent the problem as a factor graph of local exponential loss functions.  Using the factor graph representation it is possible to interpret the network classifier as an ensemble of individual node classifiers.  We then combine ideas from boosted learning with network optimization algorithms to define two novel algorithms, Boosted Expectation Propagation (BEP) and Boosted Message Passing (BMP).  These algorithms optimize the global network classifier performance by locally weighting each node classifier by the error of the surrounding network structure.  We compare the performance of BEP and BMP to logistic regression as well state of the art penalized logistic regression models on simulated grid structured networks.  The results show that using local boosting to optimize the performance of a network classifier increases classification performance and is especially powerful in cases when the whole network structure must be considered for accurate classification.},

Relying on a good policy, they learn on-policy values by propagating information upwards in the tree, but not between sibling nodes. Here, we present a generative model and a corresponding approximate message passing scheme for inference on the optimal, o-policy value of nodes in smooth and/or trees, given random roll-outs. The crucial insight is that the distribution of values in game trees is not completely arbitrary. We dene a generative model of the on-policy values using a latent score for each state, representing the value under the random roll-out policy. Inference on the values under the optimal policy separates into an inductive, pre-data step and a deductive, post-data part. Both can be solved approximately with Expectation Propagation, allowing o-policy value inference for any node in the (exponentially big) tree in linear time.},

Using agnostic hierarchical sampling assumptions, functions of observed ratings are provably close to their expectations over query ratings, on average. A joint probability distribution over queries of interest is estimated using maximum entropy regularization. The distribution resides in a convex hull of allowable candidate distributions which satisfy concentration inequalities that stem from the sampling assumptions. The method accurately estimates rating distributions on synthetic and real data and is competitive with low rank and parametric methods which make more aggressive assumptions about the problem.},

 abstract = {For many applications, a probability model can be more easily expressed as a cumulative distribution functions (CDF) as compared to the use of probability density or mass functions (PDF/PMFs). One advantage of CDF models is the simplicity of representing multivariate heavy-tailed distributions. Examples of fields that can benefit from the use of graphical models for CDFs include climatology and epidemiology, where data follow heavy-tailed distributions and exhibit spatial correlations so that dependencies between model variables must be accounted for. However, in most cases the problem of learning from data consists of optimizing the log-likelihood function with respect to model parameters where we are required to optimize a log-PDF/PMF and not a log-CDF. Given a CDF defined on a graph, we present a message-passing algorithm called the gradient-derivative-product (GDP) algorithm that allows us to learn the model in terms of the log-likelihood function whereby messages correspond to local gradients of the likelihood with respect to model parameters. We demonstrate the GDP algorithm on real-world rainfall and H1N1 mortality data and we show that the heavy-tailed multivariate distributions that arise in these problems can both be naturally parameterized and tractably estimated from data using our algorithm.},

We consider the case where the training data comes from the system’s operation but with no temporal ordering. The data are simply drawn as individual disconnected points. While making this assumption may seem absurd at first glance, many scientific modeling tasks have exactly this property. Previous work proposed methods for learning linear, discrete time models under these assumptions by optimizing approximate likelihood functions. We extend those methods to nonlinear models using kernel methods. We go on to propose a new approach that focuses on achieving temporal smoothness in the learned dynamics. The result is a convex criterion that can be easily optimized and often outperforms the earlier methods. We test these methods on several synthetic data sets including one generated from the Lorenz attractor.},

The key combinatorial diculty arises from the global constraint that the graph structure has to be acyclic. We cast the structure learning problem as a linear program over the polytope dened by valid acyclic structures. In relaxing this problem, we maintain an outer bound approximation to the polytope and iteratively tighten it by searching over a new class of valid constraints. If an integral solution is found, it is guaranteed to be the optimal Bayesian network. When the relaxation is not tight, the fast dual algorithms we develop remain useful in combination with a branch and bound method. Empirical results suggest that the method is competitive or faster than alternative exact methods based on dynamic programming.},

In this paper, we propose a new model for representing and compressing matrix factors via hashing. This allows for essentially unbounded storage (at a graceful storage / performance trade-off) for users and items to be represented in a pre-defined memory footprint. It allows us to scale recommender systems to very large numbers of users or conversely, obtain very good performance even for tiny models (e.g. 400kB of data suffice for a representation of the EachMovie problem).

In particular, we propose a generalized Bayesian PCA model, which deals with general type data by employing exponential family distributions. Model selection is realized by empirical Bayesian inference of the model. We name the model as simple exponential family PCA (SePCA), since it embraces both the principal of using a simple model for data representation and the practice of using a simplified computational procedure for the inference. Our analysis shows that the empirical Bayesian inference in SePCA formally realizes an intuitive criterion for PCA model selection - a preserved principal component must sufficiently correlate to data variance that is uncorrelated to the other principal components. Experiments on synthetic and real data sets demonstrate effectiveness of SePCA and exemplify its characteristics for model selection.},

To gain more insight, we also introduce a surprisingly simple and intuitive sparsity oracle condition to obtain a block ‘1norm bound, which is easily accessible to a broad audience in machine learning community.

 abstract = {D´ avid P´ al Abstract We study contextual multi-armed bandit prob- lems where the context comes from a metric space and the payoff satisfies a Lipschitz condi- tion with respect to the metric. Abstractly, a con- textual multi-armed bandit problem models a sit- uation where, in a sequence of independent trials, an online algorithm chooses, based on a given context (side information), an action from a set of possible actions so as to maximize the total pay- off of the chosen actions. The payoff depends on both the action chosen and the context. In con- trast, context-free multi-armed bandit problems, a focus of much previous research, model situa- tions where no side information is available and the payoff depends only on the action chosen. Our problem is motivated by sponsored web search, where the task is to display ads to a user of an Internet search engine based on her search query so as to maximize the click-through rate (CTR) of the ads displayed. We cast this prob- lem as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem where queries and ads form metric spaces and the payoff function is Lipschitz with respect to both the metrics. For any > 0 we present an algorithm with regret O(T a+b+1 a+b+2+ ) where a;b are the covering dimensions of the query space and the ad space respectively. We prove a lower bound ( T ~ a+~+1 ~ a+~+2 ) for the regret of any algo- rithm where ~ ~ are packing dimensions of the query spaces and the ad space respectively. For finite spaces or convex bounded subsets of Eu- clidean spaces, this gives an almost matching up- per and lower bound.},

Modeling the full covariance structure of the weights can provide a significant advantage for classification. However, for high-dimensional, largescale data, even though there may be many second-order feature interactions, it is computationally infeasible to maintain this covariance structure. To extend second-order methods to high-dimensional data, we develop low-rank approximations of the covariance structure. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data sets using the confidence-weighted (Dredze et al., 2008; Crammer et al., 2009a) online learning framework.

In this paper we introduce a new Markov Chain transition operator that updates all the variables of a pairwise MRF in parallel by using auxiliary Gaussian variables. The proposed MCMC operator is extremely simple to implement and to parallelize. This is achieved by a formal equivalence result between arbitrary pairwise MRFs and a particular type of Restricted Boltzmann Machine.

In this paper, we propose a framework for online, incremental sparsification with a fixed budget designed for large scale real-time model learning. The proposed approach combines a sparsification method based on an independence measure with a large scale database. In combination with an incremental learning approach such as sequential support vector regression, we obtain a regression method which is applicable in real-time online learning. It exhibits competitive learning accuracy when compared with standard regression techniques. Implementation on a real robot emphasizes the applicability of the proposed approach in real-time online model learning for real world systems.},

We use an infinite latent feature model to automatically infer this number (depending on and limited by only the number of tasks). Furthermore, our approach is applicable when the underlying task parameter subspace is inherently sparse, drawing parallels with ‘1 regularization and LASSO-style models. We also propose an augmented model which can make use of (labeled, and additionally unlabeled if available) inputs to assist learning this subspace, leading to further improvements in the performance. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of both the proposed approaches, especially when the number of examples per task is small.

 abstract = {Deep belief nets have been successful in modeling handwritten characters, but it has proved more difficult to apply them to real images. The problem lies in the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) which is used as a module for learning deep belief nets one layer at a time. The Gaussian-Binary RBMs that have been used to model real-valued data are not a good way to model the covariance structure of natural images. We propose a factored 3-way RBM that uses the states of its hidden units to represent abnormalities in the local covariance structure of an image. This provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple/complex cell architecture. Our model learns binary features that work very well for object recognition on the “tiny images” data set. Even better features are obtained by then using standard binary RBM’s to learn a deeper model.},

This is not true in imitation learning as the learned policy influences the future test inputs (states) upon which it will be tested. We show that this leads to compounding errors and a regret bound that grows quadratically in the time horizon of the task. We propose two alternative algorithms for imitation learning where training occurs over several episodes of interaction. These two approaches share in common that the learner’s policy is slowly modified from executing the expert’s policy to the learned policy. We show that this leads to stronger performance guarantees and demonstrate the improved performance on two challenging problems: training a learner to play 1) a 3D racing game (Super Tux Kart) and 2) Mario Bros.; given input images from the games and corresponding actions taken by a human expert and near-optimal planner respectively.},

The algorithm learns a separate “recognition” model that is used to quickly initialize, in a single bottom-up pass, the values of the latent variables in all hidden layers. We show that using such a recognition model, followed by a combined top-down and bottom-up pass, it is possible to efficiently learn a good generative model of high-dimensional highly-structured sensory input. We show that the additional computations required by incorporating a top-down feedback plays a critical role in the performance of a DBM, both as a generative and discriminative model. Moreover, inference is only at most three times slower compared to the approximate inference in a Deep Belief Network (DBN), making large-scale learning of DBM’s practical. Finally, we demonstrate that the DBM’s trained using the proposed approximate inference algorithm perform well compared to DBN’s and SVM’s on the MNIST handwritten digit, OCR English letters, and NORB visual object recognition tasks.},

 abstract = {Existing approaches to multi-view learning are particularly effective when the views are either independent (i.e, multi-kernel approaches) or fully dependent (i.e., shared latent spaces). However, in real scenarios, these assumptions are almost never truly satisfied. Recently, two methods have attempted to tackle this problem by factorizing the information and learn separate latent spaces for modeling the shared (i.e., correlated) and private (i.e., independent) parts of the data. However, these approaches are very sensitive to parameters setting or initialization. In this paper we propose a robust approach to factorizing the latent space into shared and private spaces by introducing orthogonality constraints, which penalize redundant latent representations. Furthermore, unlike previous approaches, we simultaneously learn the structure and dimensionality of the latent spaces by relying on a regularizer that encourages the latent space of each data stream to be low dimensional. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach, we apply it to two existing shared latent space models that assume full dependence of the views, the sGPLVM and the sKIE, and show that our constraints improve the performance of these models on the task of pose estimation from monocular images.},

This article proposes a novel boosting algorithm based on a recently introduced principle—sample variance penalization—which is motivated from an empirical version of Bernstein’s inequality. This framework leads to an efficient algorithm that is as easy to implement as AdaBoost while producing a strict generalization. Experiments on a large number of datasets show significant performance gains over AdaBoost.

This is a challenging problem since weak distributed patterns can be invisible in per node statistics as well as a global network-wide aggregate. Most prior work considers situations in which the activation/non-activation of each node is statistically independent, but this is unrealistic in many problems. In this paper, we consider structured patterns arising from statistical dependencies in the activation process. Our contributions are three-fold. First, we propose a sparsifying transform that succinctly represents structured activation patterns that conform to a hierarchical dependency graph. Second, we establish that the proposed transform facilitates detection of very weak activation patterns that cannot be detected with existing methods. Third, we show that the structure of the hierarchical dependency graph governing the activation process, and hence the network transform, can be learnt from very few (logarithmic in network size) independent snapshots of network activity.},

 abstract = {Estimating the conditional mean of an inputoutput relation is the goal of regression. However, regression analysis is not sufficiently informative if the conditional distribution has multi-modality, is highly asymmetric, or contains heteroscedastic noise. In such scenarios, estimating the conditional distribution itself would be more useful. In this paper, we propose a novel method of conditional density estimation. Our basic idea is to express the conditional density in terms of the ratio of unconditional densities, and the ratio is directly estimated without going through density estimation. Experiments using benchmark and robot transition datasets illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {The goal of sufficient dimension reduction in supervised learning is to find the low-dimensional subspace of input features that contains all of the information about the output values that the input features possess. In this letter, we propose a novel sufficient dimension-reduction method using a squared-loss variant of mutual information as a dependency measure. We apply a density-ratio estimator for approximating squared-loss mutual information that is formulated as a minimum contrast estimator on parametric or nonparametric models. Since cross-validation is available for choosing an appropriate model, our method does not require any prespecified structure on the underlying distributions. We elucidate the asymptotic bias of our estimator on parametric models and the asymptotic convergence rate on nonparametric models. The convergence analysis utilizes the uniform tail-bound of a U-process, and the convergence rate is characterized by the bracketing entropy of the model. We then develop a natural gradient algorithm on the Grassmann manifold for sufficient subspace search. The analytic formula of our estimator allows us to compute the gradient efficiently. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method compares favorably with existing dimension-reduction approaches on artificial and benchmark data sets.},

 abstract = {With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher e!ciency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parametrized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as modelbased, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems.

In order to improve accuracy on these tasks, it is natural for a decision-maker to combine predictions from various sources. However, supervised data needed to t an aggregation model is often dicult to obtain, especially if needed for multiple domains. Therefore, we propose a generative model for unsupervised aggregation which exploits the agreement signal to estimate the expertise of individual judges. Due to the large output space size, this aggregation model cannot encode expertise of constituent judges with respect to every category for all problems. Consequently, we extend it by incorporating the notion of category types to account for variability of the judge expertise depending on the type. The viability of our approach is demonstrated both on synthetic experiments and on a practical task of syntactic parser aggregation.},

We present a general framework for online multi-class learning with partial feedback that adapts the potential-based gradient descent approaches (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006). The generality of the proposed framework is verifled by the fact that Banditron (Kakade et al., 2008) is indeed a special case of our work if the potential function is set to be the squared L2 norm of the weight vector. We propose an exponential gradient algorithm for online multiclass learning with partial feedback. Compared to the Banditron algorithm, the exponential gradient algorithm is advantageous in that its mistake bound is independent from the dimension of data, making it suitable for classifying high dimensional data. Our empirical study with four data sets show that the proposed algorithm for online learning with partial feedback is comparable to the Banditron algorithm.},

 abstract = {In this paper a kernel-based online learning algorithm, which has both constant space and update time, is proposed. The approach is based on the popular online PassiveAggressive (PA) algorithm. When used in conjunction with kernel function, the number of support vectors in PA grows without bounds when learning from noisy data streams. This implies unlimited memory and ever increasing model update and prediction time. To address this issue, the proposed budgeted PA algorithm maintains only a fixed number of support vectors. By introducing an additional constraint to the original PA optimization problem, a closed-form solution was derived for the support vector removal and model update. Using the hinge loss we developed several budgeted PA algorithms that can trade between accuracy and update cost. We also developed the ramp loss versions of both original and budgeted PA and showed that the resulting algorithms can be interpreted as the combination of active learning and hinge loss PA. All proposed algorithms were comprehensively tested on 7 benchmark data sets. The experiments showed that they are superior to the existing budgeted online algorithms. Even with modest budgets, the budgeted PA achieved very competitive accuracies to the non-budgeted PA and kernel perceptron algorithms.

 abstract = {Latent variable models represent hidden structure in observational data. To account for the distribution of the observational data changing over time, space or some other covariate, we need generalizations of latent variable models that explicitly capture this dependency on the covariate. A variety of such generalizations has been proposed for latent variable models based on the Dirichlet process. We address dependency on covariates in binary latent feature models, by introducing a dependent Indian buffet process. The model generates, for each value of the covariate, a binary random matrix with an unbounded number of columns. Evolution of the binary matrices over the covariate set is controlled by a hierarchical Gaussian process model. The choice of covariance functions controls the dependence structure and exchangeability properties of the model. We derive a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for Bayesian inference, and provide experiments on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results show that explicit modeling of dependencies significantly improves accuracy of predictions.},

 abstract = {Supervised learning from multiple labeling sources is an increasingly important problem in machine learning and data mining. This paper develops a probabilistic approach to this problem when annotators may be unreliable (labels are noisy), but also their expertise varies depending on the data they observe (annotators may have knowledge about different parts of the input space). That is, an annotator may not be consistently accurate (or inaccurate) across the task domain. The presented approach produces classification and annotator models that allow us to provide estimates of the true labels and annotator variable expertise. We provide an analysis of the proposed model under various scenarios and show experimentally that annotator expertise can indeed vary in real tasks and that the presented approach provides clear advantages over previously introduced multi-annotator methods, which only consider general annotator characteristics.},

A small number of projections from lower dimensional NMR spectra are used to reconstruct the multi-dimensional NMR spectra. We propose an efficient algorithm which employs a blocked Gibbs sampler to accurately reconstruct NMR spectra. This statistical method generates samples in Bayesian scheme. Our proposed algorithm is tested on a set of six projections derived from the three-dimensional 700 MHz HNCO spectrum of HasA, a 187-residue heme binding protein.},

 abstract = {Levy processes play an important role in the stochastic process theory. However, since samples are non-i.i.d., statistical learning re- sults based on the i.i.d. scenarios cannot be utilized to study the risk bounds for Levy processes. In this paper, we present risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Levy processes in the PAC-learning frame- work. In particular, by using a concentra- tion inequality for infinitely divisible distri- butions, we first prove that the function of risk error is Lipschitz continuous with a high probability, and then by using a specific con- centration inequality for Levy processes, we obtain the risk bounds for non-i.i.d. samples drawn from Levy processes without Gaus- sian components. Based on the resulted risk bounds, we analyze the factors that affect the convergence of the risk bounds and then prove the convergence.},

 abstract = {Many real world applications employ multivariate performance measures and each example can belong to multiple classes. The currently most popular approaches train an SVM for each class, followed by ad hoc thresholding. Probabilistic models using Bayesian decision theory are also commonly adopted. In this paper, we propose aBayesian online multi-label classication framework (BOMC) which learns a probabilistic linear classier. The likelihood is modeled by a graphical model similar to TrueSkill TM , and inference is based on Gaussian density ltering with expectation propagation. Using samples from the posterior, we label the testing data by maximizing the expected F1-score. Our experiments on Reuters1-v2 dataset show BOMC compares favorably to the state-of-the-art online learners in macroaveraged F1-score and training time.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v9-zhang10c,
 abstract = {Multi-task learning seeks to improve the generalization performance of a learning task with the help of other related learning tasks. Among the multi-task learning methods proposed thus far, Bonilla et al.’s method (Bonilla et al., 2008) provides a novel multi-task extension of Gaussian process (GP) by using a task covariance matrix to model the relationships between tasks. However, learning the task covariance matrix directly has both computational and representational drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian extension by modeling the task covariance matrix as a random matrix with an inverse-Wishart prior and integrating it out to achieve Bayesian model averaging. To make the computation feasible, we first give an alternative weight-space view of Bonilla et al.’s multi-task GP model and then integrate out the task covariance matrix in the model, leading to a multi-task generalized t process (MTGTP). For the likelihood, we use a generalized t noise model which, together with the generalized t process prior, brings about the robustness advantage as well as an analytical form for the marginal likelihood. In order to specify the inverse-Wishart prior, we use the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) statistic to estimate the parameter matrix of the inverse-Wishart prior. Moreover, we investigate some theoretical properties of MTGTP, such as its asymptotic analysis and learning curve. Comparative experimental studies on two common multi-task learning applications show very promising results.

 abstract = {We propose a fully Bayesian approach for generalized kernel models (GKMs), which are extensions of generalized linear models in the feature space induced by a reproducing kernel. We place a mixture of a point-mass distribution and Silverman’s g-prior on the regression vector of GKMs. This mixture prior allows a fraction of the regression vector to be zero. Thus, it serves for sparse modeling and Bayesian computation. For inference, we exploit data augmentation methodology to develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm in which the reversible jump method is used for model selection and a Bayesian model averaging method is used for posterior prediction.},

In this paper we develop a new Bayesian nonparametric model for such a setting based on Dirichlet process priors. Building on an additive kernel model, we allow each sample to have its own regression matrix. Although this overcomplete representation could in principle sufier from severe overfltting problems, we are able to provide efiective control over the model via a matrix-variate Dirichlet process prior on the regression matrices. Our model is able to share statistical strength among regression matrices due to the clustering property of the Dirichlet process. We make use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for inference and prediction. Compared with other Bayesian kernel models, our model has advantages in both computational and statistical e‐ciency.},
