Most existing work assume that \emph{sensing information} is available to the algorithm. Under this assumption, we improve the state-of-the-art lower bound for the regret of any decentralized algorithms and introduce two algorithms, \emph{RandTopM} and \emph{MCTopM}, that are shown to empirically outperform existing algorithms. Moreover, we provide strong theoretical guarantees for these algorithms, including a notion of asymptotic optimality in terms of the number of selections of bad arms. We then introduce a promising heuristic, called \emph{Selfish}, that can operate without sensing information, which is crucial for emerging applications to Internet of Things networks. We investigate the empirical performance of this algorithm and provide some first theoretical elements for the understanding of its behavior.}

In this paper we further our understanding of these concepts in the more challenging limited feedback scenario. We consider the adversarial multi-armed bandit and linear bandit settings and solve several open problems pertaining to the existence of algorithms with favorable regret bounds under the following assumptions: (i) sparsity of the individual losses, (ii) small variation of the loss sequence, and (iii) curvature of the action set. Specifically we show that (i) for $s$-sparse losses one can obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{s T})$-regret (solving an open problem by Kwon and Perchet), (ii) for loss sequences with variation bounded by $Q$ one can obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{Q})$-regret (solving an open problem by Kale and Hazan), and (iii) for linear bandit on an $\ell_p^n$ ball one can obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n T})$-regret for $p â[1,2]$ and one has $\tilde{Î©}(n \sqrt{T})$-regret for $p>2$ (solving an open problem by Bubeck, Cesa-Bianchi and Kakade). A key new insight to obtain these results is to use regularizers satisfying more refined conditions than general self-concordance.}

The learning problem is as follows: for a fixed (and known) constraint graph $H$ with $q$ colors and an unknown graph $G=(V,E)$ with $n$ vertices, given uniformly random $H$-colorings of $G$, how many samples are required to learn the edges of the unknown graphÂ $G$? We give a characterization of $H$ for which the problem is identifiable for everyÂ $G$, i.e., we can learn $G$ with an infinite number of samples. We also show that there are identifiable constraint graphs for which one cannot hope to learn every graphÂ $G$ efficiently. We focus particular attention on the case of proper vertex $q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degreeÂ $d$ where intriguing connections to statistical physics phase transitions appear. We prove that in the tree uniqueness region (i.e., when $q>d$) the problem is identifiable and we can learn $G$ in $\mathsf{poly}(d,q)\times O(n^2\log{n})$ time. In contrast for soft-constraint systems, such as the Ising model, the best possible running time is exponential in $d$. In the tree non-uniqueness region (i.e., when $qâ¤d$) we prove that the problem is not identifiable and thus $G$ cannot be learned. Moreover, when $q<d-\sqrt{d} + Î(1)$ we prove that even learning an equivalent graph (any graph with the same set of $H$-colorings) is computationally hardâsample complexity is exponential in $n$ in the worst case. We further explore the connection between the efficiency/hardness of the structure learning problem and the uniqueness/non-uniqueness phase transition for general $H$-colorings and prove that under a well-known condition in statistical physics, known as the Dobrushin uniqueness condition, we can learnÂ $G$ in $\mathsf{poly}(d,q)\times O(n^2\log{n})$ time.}

In the probabilistic formulation of the âLearning to Orderâ problem we propose, which extends the framework for statistical Kemeny ranking aggregation developped in \citet{CKS17}, this boils down to recovering conditional Kemeny medians of $Î£$ given $X$ from i.i.d. training examples $(X_1, \Sigma_1),; \ldots,; (X_N, \Sigma_N)$. For this reason, this statistical learning problem is referred to as \textit{ranking median regression} here. Our contribution is twofold. We first propose a probabilistic theory of ranking median regression: the set of optimal elements is characterized, the performance of empirical risk minimizers is investigated in this context and situations where fast learning rates can be achieved are also exhibited. Next we introduce the concept of local consensus/median, in order to derive efficient methods for ranking median regression. The major advantage of this local learning approach lies in its close connection with the widely studied Kemeny aggregation problem. From an algorithmic perspective, this permits to build predictive rules for ranking median regression by implementing efficient techniques for (approximate) Kemeny median computations at a local level in a tractable manner. In particular, versions of $k$-nearest neighbor and tree-based methods, tailored to ranking median regression, are investigated. Accuracy of piecewise constant ranking median regression rules is studied under a specific smoothness assumption for $Î£$âs conditional distribution given $X$. The results of various numerical experiments are also displayed for illustration purpose.}

  abstract = 	 {Randomized coordinate descent (RCD) methods are state-of-the-art algorithms for training linear predictors via minimizing regularized empirical risk. When the number of examples (n) is much larger than the number of features (d), a common strategy is to apply RCD to the dual problem. On the other hand, when the number of features is much larger than the number of examples, it makes sense to apply RCD directly to the primal problem. In this paper we provide the first joint study of these two approaches when applied to L2-regularized linear ERM. First, we show through a rigorous analysis that for dense data, the above intuition is precisely correct. However, we find that for sparse and structured data,  primal RCD can significantly outperform dual RCD even if $d << n$, and vice versa, dual RCD can be much faster than primal RCD even if $n << d$. Moreover, we show that, surprisingly, a single sampling strategy minimizes both the (bound on the) number of iterations and the overall expected complexity of RCD. Note that the latter complexity measure also takes into account  the average cost of the iterations, which depends on the structure and sparsity of the data, and on the sampling strategy employed.  We confirm our theoretical predictions using extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data sets.  }

These cut-off values are fixed and unknown to the learner. We present an algorithm for this problem and prove a regret upper bound of $O(\log n)$ improving over the best known bound of $O(\log^2 n)$. Lower bounds we prove show that our upper bound is tight. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm.}

We substantially extend and generalize previous work which had only considered the binary case, thus uncovering stark differences between the two cases. We show how robust inference can be modeled as a zero-sum game between a learner who maximizes the expected accuracy, and an adversary. The value of this game is the best-attainable accuracy rate of any algorithm. We then show how the optimal policy for both the learner and adversary can be exactly characterized in terms of a particular hypergraph, specifically, as the hypergraphâs maximum fractional independent set and minimum fractional set cover, respectively. This characterization yields efficient algorithms in the size of the domain (number of possible inputs). For the typical setting that the domain is huge, we also design efficient local computation algorithms for approximating maximum fractional independent set in hypergraphs. This leads to a near optimal algorithm for the learner whose complexity is independent of the domain size, instead depending only on the rank and maximum degree of the underlying hypergraph, and on the desired approximation ratio.}

  abstract = 	 {The present paper deals with the inductive inference of recursively enumerable languages from positive data (also called text).  It introduces the learning models of \emph{verifiability} and  \emph{comparability}. The input to a verifier is an index $e$ and a text of the target languageÂ $L$, and the learner has to \emph{verify} whether or not the indexÂ $e$ input is correct for the target language $L$. A comparator receives two indices of languages from the target class $\cL$ as input and has to decide in the limit whether or not these indices generate the same language. Furthermore, \emph{standardisability} is studied, where a \emph{standardiser} receives an indexÂ $j$ of some target languageÂ $L$ from the classÂ $\cL$, and for everyÂ $Lâ\cL$ there must be an indexÂ $e$ such thatÂ $e$ generates $L$ and the standardiser has to map every indexÂ $j$  for $L$ to $e$. Additionally, the common learning models of \emph{explanatory learning}, \emph{conservative explanatory learning}, and \emph{behaviourally correct learning} are considered. For almost all learning models mentioned above it is also appropriate to consider the number of times a learner changes its mind. In particular, if no mind change occurs then we obtain the \emph{finite} variant of the models considered. Occasionally, also learning with the help of an oracle is taken into consideration. The main goal of this paper is to figure out to what extent  verifiability, comparability, and standardisability are helpful for the inductive inference of classes of recursively enumerable languages.  Here we also distinguish between \emph{indexed families}, \emph{one-one enumerable classes}, and \emph{recursively enumerable classes}.  Our results are manyfold, and an almost complete picture is obtained. In particular, for indexed families and recursively enumerable classes finite comparability, finite standardisability, and finite verifiability always imply finite learnability. If at least one mind change is allowed, then there are  differences, i.e., for indexed families, comparability or verifiability imply conservative explanatory learning, but standardisability does not; still explanatory learning can be achieved.}

The problem of designing simpler and more efficient methods for this task has been raised as an open problem in Kapralov et al.  In this paper we address this problem by employing the output perturbation mechanism. Despite being arguably the simplest and most straightforward technique, it has been overlooked due to the large global sensitivity associated with publishing the leading eigenvector.

Recently, it is discovered that the information content of a log-concave distribution concentrates around their differential entropy, albeit with an unpleasant dependence on the ambient dimension. In this work, we prove that if the potentials of the log-concave distribution are \emph{exp-concave}, which is a central notion for fast rates in online and statistical learning, then the concentration of information can be further improved to depend only on the exp-concavity parameter, and hence can be dimension independent.  Central to our proof is a novel yet simple application of the variance Brascamp-Lieb inequality. In the context of learning theory, concentration of information immediately implies high-probability results to many of the previous bounds that only hold in expectation.}

The IAB setting is relevant whenever the experimental units are human since free will, ethics, and the law may prohibit unrestricted or forced application of treatment. In particular, the setting is relevant in bandit models of dynamic clinical trials and other controlled trials on human interventions. Nonetheless, the setting has not been fully investigate in the bandit literature. We show that there are various and divergent notions of regret in this setting, all of which coincide only in the classic MAB setting. We characterize the behavior of these regrets and analyze standard MAB algorithms. We argue for a particular kind of regret that captures the causal effect of treatments but show that standard MAB algorithms cannot achieve sublinear control on this regret. Instead, we develop new algorithms for the IAB problem, prove new regret bounds for them, and compare them to standard MAB algorithms in numerical examples.}

They obtained $p$-tampering attacks that increase the error probability in the so called âtargetedâ poisoning model in which the adversaryâs goal is to increase the loss of the trained hypothesis over a particular test example. At the heart of their attack was an efficient algorithm to bias the average output of any bounded real-valued function through $p$-tampering.  In this work, we present new biasing attacks for biasing the average output of bounded real-valued functions. Our new biasing attacks achieve in \emph{polynomial-time} the the best bias  achieved by MM16 through an \emph{exponential} time $p$-tampering attack.  Our improved biasing attacks, directly imply improved $p$-tampering attacks against learners in the targeted poisoning model. As a bonus, our attacks come with considerably simpler analysis compared to previous attacks.   We also  study the possibility of PAC learning under $p$-tampering attacks in the \emph{non-targeted} (aka indiscriminate) setting where the adversaryâs goal is  to increase the risk of the generated hypothesis (for a random test example). We show that PAC learning is  \emph{possible} under $p$-tampering poisoning attacks essentially whenever it is possible in the realizable setting without the attacks. We further show that PAC learning  under âno-mistakeâ adversarial noise is \emph{not} possible, if the adversary could choose the (still limited to only $p$ fraction of) tampered examples that  she substitutes with adversarially chosen ones. Our formal model for such âbounded-budgetâ tampering attackers is  inspired by the notions of (strong) adaptive corruption in secure multi-party computation.}

The problem is motivated by its various applications to differential privacy, including the sample and aggregate technique, private data exploration, and clustering.  Without privacy concerns, minimum enclosing ball has a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS), which computes a ball of radius almost $r_{opt}$ (the problem is NP-hard to solve exactly). In contrast, under differential privacy, until this work, only a $O(\sqrt{\log n})$-approximation algorithm was known.  We provide new constructions of differentially private algorithms for minimum enclosing ball achieving constant factor approximation to $r_{opt}$ both in the centralized model (where a trusted curator collects the sensitive information and analyzes it with differential privacy) and in the local model (where each respondent randomizes her answers to the data curator to protect her privacy).  We demonstrate how to use our algorithms as a building block for approximating $k$-means in both models.}

A typical assumption exploited in this setting is that the tasks share a beneficial representation that can be learned form the joint training data of all tasks. This way, the training data of each task can be utilized to enhance the learning of other tasks in the set. Probabilistic Lipschitzness (PL) is a parameter that reflects one way in which some data representation can be beneficial for a classification learning task. In this work we propose to achieve multi-task learning by learning a kernel function relative to which each of the tasks in the set has a "high level" of probabilistic Lipschitzness. In order to be able to do that, we need to introduce a new variant of PL - one that allows reliable estimation of its value from finite size samples. We show that by having access to large amounts of training data in total (possibly the union of training sets for various tasks), the learner can identify a kernel function that would lead to fast learning rates per task when used for Nearest Neighbor classification or in a cluster-based active labeling procedure. }

We focus on a setting where covariates are supported on a metric space of low intrinsic dimension, such as a manifold embedded within a high dimensional ambient feature space. The algorithm is conceptually simple and straightforward to implement. Unlike previous methods such as the UCBogram and Adaptively Binned Successive Elimination, the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB algorithm does not require prior knowledge of the intrinsic dimension of the marginal distribution. It is also naturally anytime, without resorting to the doubling trick. We prove a regret bound for the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB algorithm which is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. In particular, the algorithm automatically takes advantage of both low intrinsic dimensionality of the marginal distribution over the covariates and low noise in the data, expressed as a margin condition. In addition, focusing on the case of bounded rewards, we give corresponding regret bounds for the $k$-Nearest Neighbour KL-UCB algorithm, which is an analogue of the KL-UCB algorithm adapted to the setting of multi-armed bandits with covariates. Finally, we present empirical results which demonstrate the ability of both the $k$-Nearest Neighbour UCB and $k$-Nearest Neighbour KL-UCB to take advantage of situations where the data is supported on an unknown sub-manifold of a high-dimensional feature space.}

  abstract = 	 {We develop and analyze efficient "coordinate-wise" methods for finding the leading eigenvector, where each step involves only a vector-vector product.  We establish global convergence with overall runtime guarantees that are at least as good as Lanczosâs method and dominate it for slowly decaying spectrum. Our methods are based on combining a shift-and-invert approach with coordinate-wise algorithms for linear regression.}

  abstract = 	 {There has been a recent surge of interest in studying permutation-based models for ranking from pairwise comparison data. Despite being structurally richer and more robust than parametric ranking models, permutation-based models are less well understood statistically and generally lack efficient learning algorithms. In this work, we study a prototype of permutation-based ranking models, namely, the noisy sorting model. We establish the optimal rates of learning the model under two sampling procedures. Furthermore, we provide a fast algorithm to achieve near-optimal rates if the observations are sampled independently. Along the way, we discover properties of the symmetric group which are of theoretical interest.}
