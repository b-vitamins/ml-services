  abstract = 	 {This paper studies the optimality of regularized regression for low order linear system identification. The nuclear norm of the systemâs Hankel matrix is added as a regularizer to the least squares cost function due to the following advantages: (1) its easy to tune regularzation weight, (2) lower sample complexity, (3) returning a Hankel matrix with a clear singular value gap, which robustly recovers a low-order linear system from noisy output observations. Recently, the performance of unregularized least squares formulations have been studied statistically in terms of finite sample complexity and recovery error; however, no results are known for the regularized approach. In this work, we show that with the advantage of sample complexity kept, the regularized algorithm beats unregularized least squares in Hankel spectral norm bound.}

Our main contribution is to provide a finite-time analysis for the performance of the proposed method. In particular, we establish an upper bound for the convergence rates of the mean square errors at the agents to zero as a function of the step sizes and the network topology.

  abstract = 	 {Vector autoregressive (VAR) models are widely used for causal discovery and forecasting in multivariate time series analysis. In the high-dimensional setting, which is increasingly common in fields such as neuroscience and econometrics, model parameters are inferred by $L_1$-regularized maximum likelihood (RML). A well-known feature of RML inference is that in general the technique produces a trade-off between sparsity and bias that depends on the choice of the regularization hyperparameter. In the context of multivariate time series analysis, sparse estimates are favorable for causal discovery and low-bias estimates are favorable for forecasting. However, owing to a paucity of research on hyperparameter selection methods, practitioners must rely on <em>ad-hoc</em> methods such as cross-validation (or manual tuning). The particular balance that such approaches achieve between the two goals â causal discovery and forecasting â is poorly understood. Our paper investigates this behavior and proposes a method (UoI-VAR) that achieves a better balance between sparsity and bias when the underlying causal influences are in fact sparse. We demonstrate through simulation that RML with a hyperparameter selected by cross-validation tends to overfit, producing relatively dense estimates. We further demonstrate that UoI-VAR much more effectively approximates the correct sparsity pattern with only a minor compromise in model fit, particularly so for larger data dimensions, and that the estimates produced by UoI-VAR exhibit less bias. We conclude that our method achieves improved performance especially well-suited to applications involving simultaneous causal discovery and forecasting in high-dimensional settings.}

  abstract = 	 {High fidelity behavior prediction of intelligent agents is critical in many applications. However, the prediction model trained on the training set may not generalize to the testing set due to domain shift and time variance. The challenge motivates the adoption of online adaptation algorithms to update prediction models in real-time to improve the prediction performance. Inspired by Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), this paper introduces a series of online adaptation methods, which are applicable to neural network-based models. A base adaptation algorithm Modified EKF with forgetting factor (MEKF_lambda) is introduced first, followed by exponential moving average filtering techniques. Then this paper introduces a dynamic multi-epoch update strategy to effectively utilize samples received in real time. With all these extensions, we propose a robust online adaptation algorithm: MEKF with Exponential Moving Average and Dynamic Multi-Epoch strategy (MEKF_EMA-DME). The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods as demonstrated in experiments.}

While reachable sets for these kinds of systems can still be estimated in a data-driven way, data-driven methods typically do not guarantee the validity of their results. However, certain data-driven approaches may be given a probabilistic guarantee of correctness, by reframing the problem as a chance-constrained optimization problem that is solved with scenario optimization. We apply this approach to the problem of approximating a reachable set by a norm ball from data. The method requires only O(n^2) sample trajectories and the solution of a convex problem. A variant of the method restricted to axis-aligned norm balls requires only O(n) samples.}

With the learned correspondences in place, we can use a simulation of one system to produce an imagined motion of its counterpart. We can also simulate in the learned latent dynamics and synthesize the motions of both corresponding systems, as a form of bisimulation. We demonstrate the approach using pairs of controlled bipedal walkers, as well as by pairing a walker with a controlled pendulum.}

  abstract = 	 {Hybrid control problems are complicated by the need to make a suitable sequence of discrete decisions related to future modes of operation of the system. Model predictive control (MPC) encodes a finite-horizon truncation of such problems as a mixed-integer program, and then imposes a cost and/or constraints on the terminal state intended to reflect all post-horizon behaviour. However, these are often ad hoc choices tuned by hand after empirically observing performance. We present a learning method that sidesteps this problem, in which the so-called N-step Q-function of the problem is approximated from below, using Bendersâ decomposition. The function takes a state and a sequence of N control decisions as arguments, and therefore extends the traditional notion of a Q-function from reinforcement learning. After learning it from a training process exploring the state-input space, we use it in place of the usual MPC objective. We take an example hybrid control task and show that it can be completed successfully with a shorter planning horizon than conventional hybrid MPC thanks to our proposed method. Furthermore, we report that Q-functions trained with long horizons can be truncated to a shorter horizon for online use, yielding simpler control laws with apparently little loss of performance.}

We consider multi-input, multi-output systems that can be expressed by a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) model. The parameters of the FIR model corresponding to each output are unknown but assumed sparse. We estimate these parameters using the Recursive Least Squares algorithm. The estimates are then improved using set-based bounds obtained by solving the Basis Pursuit Denoising problem. Our approach is able to handle hard input constraints and probabilistic output constraints. Using tools from distributionally robust optimization, we reformulate the probabilistic output constraints as tractable convex second-order cone constraints, which enables us to pose our MPC design task as a convex optimization problem. The efficacy of the developed algorithm is highlighted with a thorough numerical example, where we demonstrate performance gain over the counterpart algorithm of Bujarbaruah et al. (2018), which does not utilize the sparsity information of the system impulse response parameters during control design.}

  abstract = 	 {The identification of unknown dynamical systems using supervised learning enables model-based control of systems that cannot be modeled based on first principles. While most control literature focuses on the analysis of a static dataset, online learning control, where data points are added while the controller is running, has rarely been studied in depth. In this paper, we present a novel approach for online learning control based on Gaussian process models. To avoid computational difficulties with growing datasets, we propose a safe forgetting mechanism. Using an entropy criterion, data points are evaluated with respect to the future trajectory of the closed loop system and are âforgottenâ if the stability of the system can further be guaranteed. The approach is evaluated in a simulation and in a robotic experiment to show its real-time capability.}

  abstract = 	 {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have a form of memory where the output from a node at one timestep is fed back as input the next timestep in addition to data from the previous layer. This makes them highly suitable for timeseries analysis. However, standard RNNs have known weaknesses such as exploding/vanishing gradient and thereby struggle with a long-term memory. In this paper, we suggest a new recurrent network structure called Linear Antisymmetric RNN (LARNN). This structure is based on the numerical solution to an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) with stability properties resulting in a stable solution, which corresponds to long-term memory and trainability. Three different numerical methods are suggested to solve the ODE: Forward and Backward Euler and the midpoint method. The suggested structure has been implemented in Keras and several simulated datasets have been used to evaluate the performance. In the investigated cases, the LARNN performs better or similar to the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network which is the current state of the art for RNNs.}

  abstract = 	 {Policy optimization (PO) is a key ingredient for modern reinforcement learning (RL). For control design, certain constraints are usually enforced on the policies to optimize, accounting for either the stability, robustness, or safety concerns on the system. Hence, PO is by nature a constrained (nonconvex) optimization in most cases, whose global convergence is challenging to analyze in general. More importantly, some constraints that are safety-critical, e.g., the closed-loop stability, or the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-norm constraint that guarantees the system robustness, can be difficult to enforce on the controller being learned as the PO methods proceed. In this paper, we study the convergence theory of PO for $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ linear control with $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness guarantee. This general framework includes risk-sensitive linear control as a special case. One significant new feature of this problem, in contrast to the standard $\mathcal{H}_{2}$ linear control, namely, linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, is the lack of coercivity of the cost function. This makes it challenging to guarantee the feasibility, namely, the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness, of the iterates. Interestingly, we propose two PO algorithms that enjoy the implicit regularization property, i.e., the iterates preserve the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness, as if they are regularized by the algorithms. Furthermore, convergence to the globally optimal policies with globally sublinear and locally (super-)linear rates are provided under certain conditions, despite the nonconvexity of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first results on the implicit regularization property and global convergence of PO methods for robust/risk-sensitive control.}

In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high level objectives, which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works, we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real world unmanned ground vehicle.

  abstract = 	 {In recent years, considerable work has been done to tackle the issue of designing control laws based on observations to allow unknown dynamical systems to perform pre-specified tasks. At least as important for autonomy, however, is the issue of learning which tasks can be performed in the first place. This is particularly critical in situations where multipleÂ (possibly conflicting) tasks and requirements are demanded from the agent, resulting in infeasible specifications. Such situations arise due to over-specification or dynamic operating conditions and are only aggravated when the dynamical system model is learned through simulations. Often, these issues are tackled using regularization and penalties tuned based on application-specific expert knowledge. Nevertheless, this solution becomes impractical for large-scale systems, unknown operating conditions, and/or in online settings where expert input would be needed during the system operation. Instead, this work enables agents to autonomously pose, tune, and solve optimal control problems by compromising between performance and specification costs. Leveraging duality theory, it puts forward a counterfactual optimization algorithm that directly determines the specification trade-off while solving the optimal control problem. }

We develop a map encoder, which infers semantic class probabilities from the observation sequence, and a cost encoder, defined as deep neural network over the semantic features. Since the expert cost is not directly ob-servable, the representation parameters can only be optimized by differentiating the error between demonstrated controls and a control policy computed from the cost estimate. The error is optimized using a closed-form subgradient computed only over a subset of promising states via a motion planning algorithm. We show that our approach learns to follow traffic rules in the autonomous driving CARLA simulator by relying on semantic observations of cars, sidewalks and road lanes.}

  abstract = 	 {Recent works in high-dimensional model-predictive control and model-based reinforcement learning with learned dynamics and reward models have resorted to population-based optimization methods, such as the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM), for planning a sequence of actions. To decide on an action to take, CEM conducts a search for the action sequence with the highest return according to the learned dynamics model and reward. Action sequences are typically randomly sampled from an unconditional Gaussian distribution and evaluated. This distribution is iteratively updated towards action sequences with higher returns. However, sampling and simulating unconditional action sequences can be very inefficient (especially from a diagonal Gaussian distribution and for high dimensional action spaces). An alternative line of approaches optimize action sequences directly via gradient descent but are prone to local optima. We propose a method to solve this planning problem by interleaving CEM and gradient descent steps in optimizing the action sequence.}

Learning to satisfy STL specifications often needs a sufficient length of state history to compute reward and the next action. The need for history results in exponential state-space growth for the learning problem. Thus the learning problem becomes computationally intractable for most real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a compact means to capture state history in a new augmented state-space representation. An approximation to the objective (maximizing probability of satisfaction) is proposed and solved for in the new augmented state-space. We show the performance bound of the approximate solution and compare it with the solution of an existing technique via simulations.}

  abstract = 	 {In model-based learning, it is desirable for the learned model to preserve structural properties of the system that may facilitate easier control design or provide performance, stability or safety guarantees. Here, we consider an unknown nonlinear system possessing such a structural property - passivity, that can be used to ensure robust stability with a learned controller. We present an algorithm to learn a passive linear model of this nonlinear system from time domain input-output data. We first learn an approximate linear model of this system using any standard system identification technique. We then enforce passivity by perturbing the system matrices of the linear model, while ensuring that the perturbed model closely approximates the input-output behavior of the nonlinear system. Finally, we derive a trade-off between the perturbation size and the radius of the region in which the passivity of the linear model guarantees local passivity of the unknown nonlinear system. }

The proposed control strategy leverages the measured output from the previous iterations to improve tracking, while guaranteeing constraint satisfaction during the learning process. To achieve this, the system is modeled by a linear system with polytopic uncertainties. An RG solution based on a robust Maximal Admissable Set (MAS) is proposed that endows the ILC algorithm with constraint management capabilities. An update law on the MAS is proposed to further improve performance.}

Our approach is to use a learned perception map that predicts some linear function of the state and to design a corresponding safe set and robust controller for the closed loop system with this sensing scheme. We show that under suitable smoothness assumptions on both the perception map and the generative model relating state to complex and nonlinear data, parameters of the safe set can be learned via appropriately dense sampling of the state space.

  abstract = 	 {Many control policies used in applications compute the input or action by solving a convex optimization problem that depends on the current state and some parameters. Common examples of such convex optimization control policies (COCPs) include the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), convex model predictive control (MPC), and convex approximate dynamic programming (ADP) policies. These types of control policies are tuned by varying the parameters in the optimization problem, such as the LQR weights, to obtain good performance, judged by application-specific metrics. Tuning is often done by hand, or by simple methods such as a grid search. In this paper we propose a method to automate this process, by adjusting the parameters using an approximate gradient of the performance metric with respect to the parameters. Our method relies on recently developed methods that can efficiently evaluate the derivative of the solution of a convex program with respect to its parameters. A longer version of this paper, which illustrates our method on many examples, is available at https://web.stanford.edu/Â boyd/papers/learning_cocps.html.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of learning a linear control policy for a linear dynamical system, from demonstrations of an expert regulating the system. The standard approach to this problem is (linear) policy fitting, which fits a linear policy by minimizing a loss function between the demonstrations and the policyâs outputs plus a regularization function that encodes prior knowledge. Despite its simplicity, this method fails to learn policies with low or even finite cost when there are few demonstrations. We propose to add an additional constraint to the regularization function in policy fitting, that the policy is the solution to some LQR problem, i.e., optimal in the stochastic control sense for some choice of quadratic cost. We refer to this constraint as a Kalman constraint. Policy fitting with a Kalman constraint requires solving an optimization problem with convex cost and bilinear constraints. We propose a heuristic method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), to approximately solve this problem. An illustrative numerical experiment demonstrates that adding the Kalman constraint allows us to learn good, i.e., low cost, policies even when very few data are available.}

We first describe two sampling-based techniques; one approach provides samples of the true trajectory distribution, suitable for âground truthâ simulations, while the other draws function samples from basis function approximations of the GP. Second, we present a linearization-based technique that directly provides approximations of the trajectory distribution, taking correlations explicitly into account.

To do so, we propose studying the following two step process: first, using system identification tools rooted in subspace methods, we obtain coarse finite-data estimates of the state-space parameters, and Kalman gain describing the autonomous system; and second, we use these approximate parameters to design a filter which produces estimates of the system state.  We show that when the system identification step produces sufficiently accurate estimates, or when the underlying true KF is sufficiently robust, that a Certainty Equivalent (CE) KF, i.e., one designed using the estimated parameters directly, enjoys provable sub-optimality guarantees.  We further show that when these conditions fail, and in particular, when the CE KF is marginally stable (i.e., has eigenvalues very close to the unit circle), that imposing additional robustness constraints on the filter leads to similar sub-optimality guarantees.  We further show that with high probability, both the CE and robust filters have mean prediction error bounded by the order of inverse square root of N, where N is the number of data points collected in the system identification step.  To the best of our knowledge, these are the first end-to-end sample complexity bounds for the Kalman Filtering of an unknown system.  }

As the performance of an MPC controller depends on a sufficiently accurate objective and prediction model of the process, a significant effort in the MPC design procedure is dedicated to modeling and identification. Driven by the increasing amount of available system data and advances in the field of machine learning, data-driven MPC techniques have been developed to facilitate the MPC controller design. While these methods are able to leverage available data, they typically do not provide principled mechanisms to automatically trade off exploitation of available data and exploration to improve and update the objective and prediction model. To this end, we present a learning-based MPC formulation using posterior sampling techniques, which provides finite-time regret bounds on the learning performance while being simple to implement using off-the-shelf MPC software and algorithms. The performance analysis of the method is based on posterior sampling theory and its practical efficiency is illustrated using a numerical example of a highly nonlinear dynamical car-trailer system.}

In this work, we make the first attempt to theoretically understand the deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm (Mnih et al., 2015) from both algorithmic and statistical perspectives. In specific, we focus on the fitted Q iteration (FQI) algorithm with deep neural networks, which is a slight simplification of DQN that captures the tricks of experience replay and target network used in DQN. Under mild assumptions, we establish the algorithmic and statistical rates of convergence for the action-value functions of the iterative policy sequence obtained by FQI. In particular, the statistical error characterizes the bias and variance that arise from approximating the action-value function using deep neural network, while the algorithmic error converges to zero at a geometric rate. As a byproduct, our analysis provides justifications for the techniques of experience replay and target network, which are crucial to the empirical success of DQN. Furthermore, as a simple extension of DQN, we propose the Minimax-DQN algorithm for zero-sum Markov game with two players, which is deferred to the appendix due to space limitations.}

In this paper, we provide an information theory-based model predictive control method that anticipates the learning effect when exploring dynamical systems, and steers the system towards the most informative points. We employ a Gaussian process to model the system dynamics, which enables us to quantify the model uncertainty and estimate future information gains. We include a numerical example illustrates that illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

  abstract = 	 {In Bansal et al. (2019), a novel visual navigation framework that combines learning-based and model-based approaches has been proposed. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) predicts a waypoint that is used by the dynamics model for planning and tracking a trajectory to the waypoint. However, the CNN inevitably makes prediction errors, ultimately leading to collisions, especially when the robot is navigating through cluttered and tight spaces. In this paper, we present a novel Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based method to generate supervision for the CNN for waypoint prediction. By modeling the prediction error of the CNN as disturbances in dynamics, the proposed method generates waypoints that are robust to these disturbances, and consequently to the prediction errors. Moreover, using globally optimal HJ reachability analysis leads to predicting waypoints that are time-efficient and do not exhibit greedy behavior. Through simulations and experiments on a hardware testbed, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach for navigation tasks where the robot needs to navigate through cluttered, narrow indoor environments.}

Similarly, the algorithm we analyze is known to converge for problems with finite policies, but we identify the conditions required to guarantee convergence with probability one when the policy space is infinite regardless of the number of states.

In each step, belief update is performed according to Bayesâ rule using the agentsâ current load and a realization of costs on resources that they utilized. Then, agents choose a new load using an adaptive strategy update rule that accounts for their preferred allocation based on the updated belief. We prove that beliefs and loads generated by this learning dynamics converge almost surely. The convergent belief accurately estimates cost distributions of resources that are utilized by the convergent load. We establish conditions on the initial load and strategy updates under which the cost estimation is accurate on all resources. These results apply to Bayesian learning in congestion games with unknown latency functions. Particularly, we provide conditions under which the load converges to an equilibrium or socially optimal load with complete information of cost parameter. We also design an adaptive tolling mechanism that eventually induces the socially optimal outcome. }

We argue that a reasonable RL policy for such settings must be based on online training, since any policy based only on finite samples cannot perform well in the entire unbounded state space. We introduce such an online RL policy using Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle. To analyze this policy, we propose an appropriate notion of desirable performance in terms of stability: the state dynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high probability. We show that if the system dynamics under optimal policy respects a Lyapunov function, then our policy is stable. Our policy does not need to know the Lyapunov function. Moreover, the assumption of existence Lyapunov function is not restrictive as this assumption is equivalent to the positive recurrence or stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can stabilize the system then it must posses a Lyapunov function.}

PQ-learning maintains two separate Q-value estimates â the online estimate and target estimate. The online estimate follows the standard Q-learning update, while the target estimate is updated periodically.

We propose a robust adaptive control algorithm that explicitly incorporates such non-asymptotic uncertainties into the control design. The algorithm has three components: (1) a least-squares nominal model estimator; (2) a bootstrap resampling method that quantifies non-asymptotic variance of the nominal model estimate; and (3) a non-conventional robust control design method using an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) with multiplicative noise. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that the system identification and robust control design procedures both use stochastic uncertainty representations, so that the actual inherent statistical estimation uncertainty directly aligns with the uncertainty the robust controller is being designed against. We show through numerical experiments that the proposed robust adaptive controller can significantly outperform the certainty equivalent controller on both expected regret and measures of regret risk.}

To address this challenge, we present a deep robust regression model that is trained to directly predict the uncertainty bounds for safe exploration. We derive generalization bounds for learning and connect them with safety and stability bounds in control. We demonstrate empirically that our robust regression approach can outperform the conventional Gaussian process (GP) based safe exploration in settings where it is difficult to specify a good GP prior.}

In unknown environments the agent needs to learn a model of the system dynamics to make planning applicable. This is particularly challenging when the underlying states are only indirectly observable through high-dimensional observations such as images. We propose to learn a deep latent Gaussian process dynamics (DLGPD) model that learns low-dimensional system dynamics from environment interactions with visual observations. The method infers latent state representations from observations using neural networks and models the system dynamics in the learned latent space with Gaussian processes. All parts of the model can be trained jointly by optimizing a lower bound on the likelihood of transitions in image space. We evaluate the proposed approach on the pendulum swing-up task while using the learned dynamics model for planning in latent space in order to solve the control problem. We also demonstrate that our method can quickly adapt a trained agent to changes in the system dynamics from just a few rollouts. We compare our approach to a state-of-the-art purely deep learning based method and demonstrate the advantages of combining Gaussian processes with deep learning for data efficiency and transfer learning.}

In this paper we focus on finite-horizon episodic RL where the transition model admits the linear parametrization: $P = \sum_{i=1}^{d} (\theta)_{i}P_{i}$. This parametrization provides a universal function approximation and capture several useful models and applications. We propose an upper confidence model-based RL algorithm with value-targeted model parameter estimation. The algorithm updates the estimate of $\theta$ by recursively solving a regression problem using the latest value estimate as the target. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by proving its expected regret bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H, T, d$ are the horizon, total number of steps and dimension of $\theta$. This regret bound is independent of the total number of states or actions, and is close to a lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{HdT})$.}

  abstract = 	 {Our previous work proposed an approach to localized adaptive and robust control over a large-scale network of systems subject to a single topological modification. In this paper, we develop this approach into an iterative scheme to handle multiple topological modifications over time, which switch between configurations in a finite-state Markov chain. Each system in the network uses its local information to robustly control its own state while also learning the current state of the network topology (i.e. which state of the Markov chain it is currently in). Additionally, each system maintains an estimate of certain parameters for the overall network, for instance, the transition probabilities of the Markov chain, and each system uses standard average consensus methods to update its estimate. We simulate a simple centered hexagon network with 7 systems and 4 different topological states, and show that each system in the network manages to stabilize under a control law that uses only local information, and adapts to the current topology within a reasonable amount of time after a switch is made.}

  abstract = 	 {One of the most promising devices for realizing power production through nuclear fusion is the tokamak. To maximize performance, it is preferable that tokamak reactors achieve advanced operating scenarios characterized by good plasma confinement, improved magnetohydrodynamic stability, and a largely non-inductively driven plasma current. Such scenarios could enable steady-state reactor operation with high fusion gain â the ratio of produced fusion power to the external power provided through the plasma boundary. Precise and robust control of the evolution of the plasma boundary shape as well as the spatial distribution of the plasma current, density, temperature, and rotation will be essential to achieving and maintaining such scenarios. The complexity of the evolution of tokamak plasmas, arising due to nonlinearities and coupling between various parameters, motivates the use of model-based control algorithms that can account for the system dynamics. In this work, a learning-based accelerated model trained on data from the National Spherical Torus Experiment Upgrade (NSTX-U) is employed to develop planning and control strategies for regulating the density and temperature profile evolution around desired trajectories. The proposed model combines empirical scaling laws developed across multiple devices with neural networks trained on empirical data from NSTX-U and a database of first-principles-based computationally intensive simulations. The reduced execution time of the accelerated model will enable practical application of optimization algorithms and reinforcement learning approaches for scenario planning and control development. An initial demonstration of applying optimization approaches to the learning-based model is presented, including a strategy for mitigating the effect of leaving the finite validity range of the accelerated model. The approach shows promise for actuator planning between experiments and in real-time.}

  abstract = 	 {We present a deep recurrent neural network architecture to solve a class of stochastic optimal control problems described by fully nonlinear Hamilton Jacobi Bellman partial differential equations. Such PDEs arise when considering stochastic dynamics characterized by uncertainties that are additive, state dependent, and control multiplicative. Stochastic models with these characteristics are important in computational neuroscience, biology, finance, and aerospace systems and provide a more accurate representation of actuation than models with only additive uncertainty. Previous literature has established the inadequacy of the linear HJB theory for such problems, so instead, methods relying on the generalized version of the Feynman-Kac lemma have been proposed resulting in a system of second-order Forward-Backward SDEs. However, so far, these methods suffer from compounding errors resulting in lack of scalability. In this paper, we propose a deep learning based algorithm that leverages the second-order FBSDE representation and LSTM-based recurrent neural networks to not only solve such stochastic optimal control problems but also overcome the problems faced by traditional approaches, including scalability. The resulting control algorithm is tested on a high-dimensional linear system and three nonlinear systems from robotics and biomechanics in simulation to demonstrate feasibility and out-performance against previous methods.}

To this end, a recently proposed differentiable physics engine for two-dimensional objects is adopted in this work and extended to deal forces in the three-dimensional space. The proposed model identification technique analytically computes the gradient of the distance between forecasted poses of objects and their actual observed poses, and utilizes that gradient to search for values of the mechanical properties that reduce the reality gap.}

Recent work in MBRL has mostly focused on using more advanced function approximators and planning schemes, with little development of the general framework.In this paper, we identify a fundamental issue of the standard MBRL framework â what we call the objective mismatch issue. Objective mismatch arises when one objective is optimized in the hope that a second, often uncorrelated, metric will also be optimized. In the context of MBRL, we characterize the objective mismatch between training the forward dynamics model w.r.t. the likelihood of the one-step ahead prediction, and the overall goal of improving performance on a downstream control task. For example, this issue can emerge with the realization that dynamics models effective for a specific task do not necessarily need to be globally accurate, and vice versa globally accurate models might not be sufficiently accurate locally to obtain good control performance on a specific task. In our experiments, we study this objective mismatch issue and demonstrate that the likelihood of one-step ahead predictions is not always correlated with control performance. This observation highlights a critical limitation in the MBRL framework which will require further research to be fully understood and addressed. We propose an initial method to mitigate the mismatch issue by re-weighting dynamics model training. Building on it, we conclude with a discussion about other potential directions of research for addressing this issue.}

Challenges still remain, however, before such hands can attain human-like performance due to complex dynamics and contacts. In particular, useful models for planning, control or model-based reinforcement learning are still lacking. Recently, data-driven approaches for such models have shown promise. This work provides the first large public dataset of real within-hand manipulation that facilitates building such models, along with baseline data-driven modeling results.

ZODPO only requires limited communication and storage even in large-scale systems. Further, we investigate the nonasymptotic performance of ZODPO and show that the sample complexity to approach a stationary point is polynomial with the error toleranceâs inverse and the problem dimensions, demonstrating the scalability of ZODPO.

  abstract = 	 {We consider a networked linear system where system matrices are unknown to the individual agents but sampled data is available to them.  We propose a data-driven method for designing a distributed linear-quadratic controller where agents learn a non-parametric system model from a single sample trajectory in which nodes can predict future trajectories using only data available to themselves and their neighbors. Based on this system representation, we propose a control scheme where a network optimization problem is solved in a receding horizon manner. We show that the proposed control scheme is stabilizing and validate our results through numerical experiments.}

  abstract = 	 {Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) works well when experience can be collected cheaply and model-based RL is effective when system dynamics can be modeled accurately. However, both assumptions can be violated in real world problems such as robotics, where querying the system can be expensive and real-world dynamics can be difficult to model. In contrast to RL, Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms use a simulator to optimize a simple policy class online, constructing a closed-loop controller that can effectively contend with real-world dynamics. MPC performance is usually limited by factors such as model bias and the limited horizon of optimization. In this work, we present a novel theoretical connection between information theoretic MPC and entropy regularized RL and develop a Q-learning algorithm that can leverage biased models. We validate the proposed algorithm on sim-to-sim control tasks to demonstrate the improvements over optimal control and reinforcement learning from scratch. Our approach paves the way for deploying reinforcement learning algorithms on real systems in a systematic manner.}

The algorithm is motivated by the Bellman saddle point formulation. It learns the optimal state-action distribution, which encodes a randomized policy, by interacting with the environment along a single trajectory and making primal-dual updates. The key to the analysis is to establish a connection between the min-max duality gap of Bellman saddle point and the cumulative regret of the learning agent. We show that, for ergodic AMDPs with finite state space $\mathcal{S}$ and action space $\mathcal{A}$ and uniformly bounded mixing times, the algorithmâs $T$-time step regret is $$ R(T)=\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \left(t_{mix}^*\right)^2 \tau^{\frac{3}{2}} \sqrt{(\tau^3 + |\mathcal{A}|) |\mathcal{S}| T} \right), $$ where $t_{mix}^*$ is the worst-case mixing time, $\tau$ is an ergodicity parameter, $T$ is the number of time steps and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides polylog factors.}

  abstract = 	 {The fragility of deep neural networks to adversarially-chosen inputs has motivated the need to revisit deep learning algorithms. Including adversarial examples during training is a popular defense mechanism against adversarial attacks. This mechanism can be formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the adversary seeks to maximize the loss function using an iterative first-order algorithm while the learner attempts to minimize it. However, finding adversarial examples in this way causes excessive computational overhead during training. By interpreting the min-max problem as an optimal control problem, it has recently been shown that one can exploit the compositional structure of neural networks in the optimization problem to  improve the training time significantly. In this paper, we provide the first convergence analysis of this adversarial training algorithm by combining techniques from robust optimal control and inexact oracle methods in optimization. Our analysis sheds light on how the hyperparameters of the algorithm affect the its stability and convergence. We support our insights with experiments on a robust classification problem.}

This trade-off is explicitly taken into account in the dual control problem, for which the exact solution is provided by stochastic dynamic programming. Due to its computational intractability, we propose a sampling-based approximation for systems affected by both parametric and structural model uncertainty. The approach proposed in this paper separates the prediction horizon in a dual and an exploitation part. The dual part is formulated as a scenario tree that actively discriminates among a set of potential models while learning unknown parameters. In the exploitation part,  achieved information is fixed for each scenario, and open-loop control sequences are computed for the remainder of the horizon. As a result, we solve one optimization problem over a collection of control sequences for the entire horizon, explicitly considering the knowledge gained in each scenario, leading to a dual model predictive control formulation.}

Current trends in reinforcement learning (RL) focus on complex representations of dynamics and policies. Such approaches have yielded impressive results in solving a variety of hard control tasks. However, this new sophistication has come with the cost of an overall reduction in our ability to interpret the resulting policies from a classical perspective, and the need for extremely over-parameterized controllers. In this paper, we take inspiration from the control community and apply the principles of hybrid switching systems, in order to break down complex representations into simpler components. We exploit the rich representational power of probabilistic graphical models and derive a new expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for learning a generative model and automatically decomposing nonlinear dynamics into stochastic switching linear dynamical systems. Moreover, we show how this framework of probabilistic switching models enables extracting hierarchies of Markovian and auto-regressive locally linear controllers from nonlinear experts in an imitation learning scenario.}

  abstract = 	 {Bayesian optimization is a framework for global search via maximum a posteriori updates rather than simulated annealing, and has gained prominence in tuning the hyper-parameters of machine learning algorithms and more broadly, in decision-making under uncertainty. In this work, we cast Bayesian optimization as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is sampled from a Gaussian process (GP). Further, we focus on action selections via the GP upper confidence bound (UCB). While numerous prior works use GPs in bandit settings, they do not apply to settings where the total number of iterations $T$ may be large-scale, as the complexity of computing the posterior parameters scales cubically with the number of past observations. To circumvent this computational burden, we propose a simple statistical test: only incorporate an action into the GP posterior when its conditional entropy exceeds an $\epsilon$ threshold. Doing so permits us to derive sublinear regret bounds of GP bandit algorithms up to factors depending on the compression parameter $\epsilon$ for both discrete and continuous action sets. Moreover, the complexity of the GP posterior remains provably finite. Experimentally, we observe state of the art accuracy and complexity tradeoffs for GP bandit algorithms on various hyper-parameter tuning tasks, suggesting the merits of managing the complexity of  GPs in bandit settings.}

  abstract = 	 {Markovian jump linear systems (MJLS) are an important class of dynamical systems that arise in many control applications. In this paper, we introduce the problem of controlling unknown MJLS as a new reinforcement learning benchmark for Markov decision processes with mixed continuous/discrete state variables. Compared with the traditional linear quadratic regulator (LQR), our proposed problem leads to a special hybrid MDP (with mixed continuous and discrete variables) and poses significant new challenges due to the appearance of an underlying Markov jump parameter governing the mode of the system dynamics. Specifically, the state of a MJLS does not form a Markov chain and hence one cannot study the MJLS control problem as a MDP with solely continuous state variable. However, one can augment the state and the jump parameter to obtain a MDP with a mixed continuous-discrete state space. We discuss how control theory sheds light on the policy parameterization of such hybrid MDPs. Using a recently developed policy gradient results for MJLS, we show that we can use data-driven methods to solve the discounted cost version of the LQR problem. We modify the widely used natural policy gradient method to directly learn the optimal state feedback control policy for MJLS without identifying either the system dynamics or the transition probability of the switching parameter. We implement the (data-driven) natural policy gradient method on different MJLS examples. Our simulation results suggest that the natural gradient method can efficiently learn the optimal controller for MJLS with unknown dynamics. }
