Our methodology involves fine-tuning the upper layers of a pre-trained FastSpeech2 model and fusing it with information from a reference mel-spectrogram during inference via a convolution-based, or an attention-based, blending network. Comparative evaluations against baseline methods and against state-of-the-art techniques on single-speaker (LJSpeech) as well as multi-speaker (VCTK) datasets, employing both subjective and objective measures, demonstrate the superior quality of our approach, yielding significantly more natural-sounding speech edits.}

  abstract = 	 {A major tenet of conventional wisdom dictates that models should not be over-parameterized: the number of free parameters should not exceed the number of training data points. This tenet originates from centuries of shallow learning, primarily in the form of linear or logistic regression. It is routinely applied to all kinds of data analyses and modeling and even to infer properties of the brain. However, through a variety of precise mathematical examples, we show that this conventional wisdom is completely wrong as soon as one moves from shallow to deep learning. In particular, we construct sequences of both linear and non-linear deep learning models whose number of parameters can grow to infinity, while the training set can remain very small (e.g. a single example). In deep models, the parameter space is partitioned into large equivalence classes. Learning can be viewed as a communication process where information is communicated from the data to the synaptic weights. The information in the training data only needs to specify an equivalence class of the parameters, and not the exact parameter values. As such, the number of training examples can be significantly smaller than the number of free parameters.}

This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for goal-based investing that addresses market non-stationarity through prompt reactions to regime switches.

The experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms several benchmarks commonly used in goal-based investing.}

This paper presents a pipeline for melanoma diagnostics, leveraging two convolutional neural networks, a diagnosis, and a prognosis model. The diagnostic model is responsible for localizing malignant patches across whole slide images and delivering a patient-level diagnosis as malignant or benign. Further, the prognosis model utilizes the diagnostic modelâs output to provide a patient-level prognosis as good or bad. The full pipeline has an F1 score of 0.79 when tested on data from the same distribution as it was trained on.}

  abstract = 	 {Industrial applications often depend on costly computation infrastructures. Well optimised schedulers provide cost efficient utilization of these computational resources, but they can take significant effort to implement. It can also be beneficial to split the application into a hierarchy of tasks represented as a conditional task graph. In such case, the tasks in the hierarchy are conditionally executed, depending on the output of the earlier tasks. While such conditional task graphs can save computational resources, they also add complexity to scheduling. Recently, there has been research on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based schedulers, but they mostly do not address conditional task graphs. We design a DRL based scheduler for conditional task graphs in a heterogeneous execution environment. We measure how the probabilities of a conditional task graph affects the scheduler and how these adverse effects can be mitigated. We show that our solution learns to beat traditional baseline schedulers in a fraction of an hour.}

Although NODEs offer superior modelling capabilities, little research has been conducted on understanding the factors that contribute to their predictions on image datasets. In this paper, we propose the leveraging of SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which is an influential explainable artificial intelligence method, to gain insights into the NODEs prediction process. We enable the interpretable analysis of important pixels that contribute to the prediction decisions of NODEs by adapting SHAP to the continuous-time nature thereof. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach in revealing the dynamics and important features that drive NODEs predictions. Our empirical findings provide insights into how NODEs determine important features and the distributions of the Shapley values of each class. The proposed integration of SHAP with NODEs contributes to the broader goal of enhancing transparency and trustworthiness in the application of continuous-time models to complex real-world systems.}

To assess the task, both binary and multiclass networks have undergone training, allowing for a comparison of the two approaches.

Traditional methods of updating urban-area maps based on aerial photography are labor-intensive and struggle to keep pace with rapid urban development. Automated algorithms for detecting new and removed buildings based on bi-temporal images typically either rely on comparing mono-temporal building detection outputs or requiring examples of new and removed buildings for training. This study presents a novel method using self-supervised learning principles to train a distinct object-change scoring network. It repurposes segments of the (potentially imperfect) delineations used in single-temporal detector training, harnesses bi-temporal data attributes, and leverages the assumption that most buildings remain unchanged over time. This eliminates the need for explicit examples of new or removed buildings, while still overcome usual constraints of post-detection output-mask comparison methods. We provide precision-recall curves and examples demonstrating the improved performance of the suggested approach. Furthermore, we discuss several immediate algorithmic variations that hold the potential for even further enhancements in performance.}

While reducing the error rate of the classifier is of primary importance, it is impossible to completely remove it. Having a system that is able to flag wrong or suspicious classifications is therefore a necessary component for safety and robustness in operations. In this work, we present a general statistical inference framework for detection of misclassifications. We test our approach on two well-known benchmark datasets: MNIST and CIFAR-10.

  abstract = 	 {Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE) have been trained as both Variational Autoencoders, and as GANs. However, the resulting Stochastic Differential Equations can be hard to interpret or analyse due to the generic nature of the drift and diffusion fields. By restricting our NSDE to be of the form of Langevin dynamics and training it as a VAE, we obtain NSDEs that lend themselves to more elaborate analysis and to a wider range of visualisation techniques than a generic NSDE. More specifically, we obtain an energy landscape, the minima of which are in one-to-one correspondence with latent states underlying the used data. This not only allows us to detect states underlying the data dynamics in an unsupervised manner but also to infer the distribution of time spent in each state according to the learned SDE. In general, restricting an NSDE to Langevin dynamics enables the use of a large set of tools from computational molecular dynamics for the analysis of the obtained results.}

  abstract = 	 {Brain lesions detected in magnetic resonance images often vary in type and rarity across different cohorts, posing a challenge for deep learning techniques that are typically specialized in recognizing single lesion types from homogenous data. This limitation restricts their practicality in diverse clinical settings. In this study, we explore different deep-learning approaches to develop robust models handling both subject and imaging variability, while recognizing multiple lesion types. Our research focuses on segmentation and detection tasks across four distinct datasets, encompassing six cohorts of subjects with white matter hyperintensities, multiple sclerosis lesions, or stroke abnormalities. Our findings reveal that a cascade approach, comprising a fully convolutional network and a fully connected classifier, offers optimal accuracy for robust multiclass lesion segmentation and detection. Notably, our proposed model remains competitive with models trained solely on one dataset and applied to the same dataset while showing robustness against domain shifts. Additionally, in related tasks, our model consistently produces results comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. This study contributes to advancing clinically applicable deep learning techniques for brain lesion recognition, offering a promising solution for handling lesion diversity in uncontrolled clinical environments.}

However, benchmarks to evaluate deidentification methods are themselves often derived from real clinical data, making them sensitive themselves and therefore harder to share and apply. Given the rapid advances in generative language modelling, we would like to leverage large language models to construct freely available deidentification benchmarks, and to assist in the deidentification process. We apply the GPT-4 language model to, for the first time, construct a synthetic and publicly available dataset of synthetic Norwegian discharge summaries with annotated identifying details, consisting of 1200 summaries averaging 100 words each. In our sample of documents, we find that the generated annotations highly agree with human annotations, with an $F_1$ score of $0.983$. We then examine whether large language models can be applied directly to perform deidentification themselves, proposing methods where an instruction-tuned language model is prompted to either annotate or redact identifying details. Comparing the methods on our synthetic dataset and the NorSynthClinical-PHI dataset, we find that GPT-4 underperforms the baseline method proposed by BrÃ¥then et al. (2021), suggesting that named entity recognition problems are still challenging for instruction-tuned language models.}

We present local gamma augmentation, a technique for introducing new instances of  intensities in pathological tissues. We leverage local gamma augmentation to compensate for a bias in intensities corresponding to ischemic stroke lesions in human brain MRIs. On three datasets, we show how local gamma augmentation can improve the image-level sensitivity of a deep neural network tasked with ischemic lesion segmentation on magnetic resonance images.}

The core of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis showed us the potential of pruning to reduce such parameters without a significant drop in accuracy. Quaternion neural networks achieve comparable accuracy to equivalent real-valued networks on multi-dimensional prediction tasks. In our work, we implement pruning on real and quaternion-valued implementations of large-scale networks in the task of image recognition. For instance, our implementation of the ResNet-101 architecture on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet64x64 datasets resulted in pruned quaternion models outperforming their real-valued counterparts by 4% and 7% in accuracy at sparsities of about 6% and 0.4%, respectively. We also got quaternion implementations of ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 on CIFAR-100 with steady Lottery tickets, whereas the Real counterpart failed to train at the same sparsity. Our experiments show that the pruned quaternion implementations perform better at higher sparsity than the corresponding real-valued counterpart, even in some larger neural networks.}

Despite the powerful performance, the architecture often does not perform well when used on data which has different characteristics than the data it was trained on. Many techniques for improving performance in the presence of domain shift have been developed, however typically only have loose connections to the theory of domain adaption. In this work, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for U-Nets with theoretical guarantees based on the Margin Disparity Discrepancy called the MDD-UNet. We evaluate the proposed technique on the task of hippocampus segmentation, and find that the MDD-UNet is able to learn features which are domain-invariant with no knowledge about the labels in the target domain. The MDD-UNet improves performance over the standard U-Net on 11 out of 12 combinations of datasets. This work serves as a proof of concept by demonstrating an improvement on the U-Net in itâs standard form without modern enhancements, which opens up a new avenue of studying domain adaptation for models with very large hypothesis spaces from both methodological and practical perspectives.}

  abstract = 	 {Semantic representations of text, i.e. representations of natural language which capture meaning by geometry, are essential for areas such as information retrieval and document grouping. High-dimensional trained dense vectors have received much attention in recent years as such representations. We investigate the structure of semantic spaces that arise from embeddings made with Sentence-BERT and find that the representations suffer from a well-known problem in high dimensions called hubness. Hubness results in asymmetric neighborhood relations, such that some texts (the hubs) are neighbours of many other texts while most texts (so-called anti-hubs), are neighbours of few or no other texts. We quantify the semantic quality of the embeddings using hubness scores and error rate of a neighbourhood based classifier. We find that when hubness is high, we can reduce error rate and hubness using hubness reduction methods. We identify a combination of two methods as resulting in the best reduction. For example, on one of the tested pretrained models, this combined method can reduce hubness by about 75% and error rate by about 9%. Thus, we argue that mitigating hubness in the embedding space provides better semantic representations of text.}

PSP is the estimation of the 3D structure of a protein, generally through deep learning architectures. Information about the geometry of the protein chain has been proven to be crucial for accurate predictions of 3D structures. However, this information is usually flattened as machine learning features that are not representative of the geometric nature of the problem. Leveraging recent advances in geometric deep learning, we redesign a PSP architecture with the addition of CGENN layers. CGENNs can achieve better generalization and robustness when dealing with data that show rotational or translational invariance such as protein coordinates, which are independent of the chosen reference frame. CGENNs inputs, outputs, weights and biases are objects in the Geometric Algebra of 3D Euclidean space, i.e. $\mathcal{G}_{3,0,0}$, and hence are interpretable from a geometrical perspective. We test 6 approaches to PSP and show that CGENN layers increase the prediction accuracy by up to 2.1%, with fewer trainable parameters compared to linear layers and give a clear geometric interpretation of their outputs.}

Prior works have shown that DPS metrics are good at estimating human perception of similarity, so-called perceptual similarity. However, it remains unknown whether such metrics can be adapted to other contexts. In this work, DPS metrics are evaluated for their adaptability to different contradictory similarity contexts. Such contexts are created by randomly ranking six image distortions. Metrics are adapted to consider distortions more or less disruptive to similarity depending on their place in the random rankings. This is done by training pretrained CNNs to measure similarity according to given contexts. The adapted metrics are also evaluated on a perceptual similarity dataset to evaluate whether adapting to a ranking affects their prior performance. The findings show that DPS metrics can be adapted with high performance. While the adapted metrics have difficulties with the same contexts as baselines, performance is improved in 99% of cases. Finally, it is shown that the adaption is not significantly detrimental to prior performance on perceptual similarity. The implementation of this work is available online.}

Methods: We present a deep learning based tree species classification model utilizing only lidar (Light Detection And Ranging) data. The lidar images are segmented into four classes (Norway Spruce, Scots Pine, Birch, background) with a U-Net based network. The model is trained with focal loss over partial weak labels. A major benefit of the approach is that both the lidar imagery and the base map for the labels have free and open access. Results: Our tree species classification model achieves a macro-averaged $\mathrm{F}_1$ score of 0.70 on an independent validation with National Forest Inventory (NFI) in-situ sample plots.
