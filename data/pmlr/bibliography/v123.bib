 abstract = {Open-ended learning, also called life-long learning or autonomous curriculum learning, aims to program machines and robots that autonomously acquire knowledge and skills in a cumulative fashion.  We illustrate the first edition of the REAL-2019 â Robot open-Ended Autonomous Learning competition, prompted by the EU project GOAL-Robots â Goal-based Open-ended Autonomous Learning Robots. The competition was based on a simulated robot that: (a) acquires sensorimotor competence to interact with objects on a table; (b) learns autonomously based on mechanisms such as curiosity, intrinsic motivations, and self-generated goals. The competition featured a first intrinsic phase, where the robots learned to interact with the objects in a fully autonomous way (no rewards, predefined tasks or human guidance), and a second extrinsic phase, where the acquired knowledge was evaluated with tasks unknown during the first phase. The competition ran online on AIcrowd for six months, involved 75 subscribers and 6 finalists, and was presented at NeurIPS-2019. The competition revealed very hard as it involved difficult machine learning challenges usually tackled in isolation, such as exploration, sparse rewards, object learning, generalisation, catastrophic interference, and autonomous skill learning. Following the participantâs positive feedback, the preparation of a second REAL-2020 competition is underway, improving on the formulation of a relevant benchmark for open-ended learning.},

 abstract = {Modern machine learning systems are still lacking in the kind of general intelligence and common sense reasoning found, not only in humans, but across the animal kingdom. Many animals are capable of solving seemingly simple tasks such as inferring object location through object persistence and spatial elimination, and navigating efficiently in out-of-distribution novel environments. Such tasks are difficult for AI, but provide a natural stepping stone towards the goal of more complex human-like general intelligence. The extensive literature on animal cognition provides methodology and experimental paradigms for testing such abilities but, so far, these experiments have not been translated en masse into an AI-friendly setting. We present a new testbed, Animal-AI, first released as part of the Animal-AI Olympics competition at NeurIPS 2019, which is a comprehensive environment and testing paradigm for tasks inspired by animal cognition. In this paper we outline the environment, the testbed, the results of the competition, and discuss the open challenges for building and testing artificial agents capable of the kind of nonverbal common sense reasoning found in many non-human animals.},

 abstract = {Machine learning competitions have grown in popularity and impact over the last decade, emerging as an effective means to advance the state of the art by posing well-structured, relevant, and challenging problems to the community at large. Motivated by a reward or merely the satisfaction of seeing their machine learning algorithm reach the top of a leaderboard, practitioners innovate, improve, and tune their approach before evaluating on a held-out dataset or environment. The competition track of NeurIPS has matured in 2019, its third year, with a considerable increase in both the number of challenges and the diversity of domains and topics. Demonstrations offer a complementary dimension to the competitions, focusing on areas of machine learning which are either human interactive or demonstrable in some way, for instance robotics applications or generative models.  This volume is a compilation of selected papers associated with the NeurIPS 2019 Demonstration and Competition Track. The scope of the volume includes the design of the competitions, analysis of the results, novel methodologies developed to respond to the competitionsâ challenges, and the design and development of creative demonstrations. },

 abstract = {Reconnaissance blind chess (RBC) is a chess variant in which a player cannot see her opponent’s pieces but can learn about them through private, explicit sensing actions. The game presents numerous research challenges, and was the focus of a competition held in conjunction with of the 2019 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS). The 22 bots that played in the tournament leveraged a diverse set of algorithms, including variations of multi-state tracking, piece-wise probability estimation, Gibbs sampling, bandit algorithms, tree search, counterfactual regret minimization (CFR), deep learning, and others. None of the algorithms of which we are aware converges to an optimal strategy. Top algorithms generally incorporated sensing strategies that successfully minimized uncertainty (as measured in the number of possible opponent states). The top two approaches reduced this raw uncertainty metric less than some others. Successful strategies sometimes defied conventional wisdom in chess, as evidenced by deviations between win rate and aggregate move strength as assessed by the leading available chess engine.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to deal with predictions of speed, volume, and main traffic direction, in a new aggregated way of traffic data presented as videos. The approach leverages the continuity in a sequence of frames and its dynamics, learning to predict changing areas in a low dimensional space and then, recovering static features when reconstructing the original space. Exogenous variables like weather, time and calendar are also added in the model. Furthermore, we introduce a novel sampling approach for sequences that ensures diversity when creating batches, running in parallel to the optimization process.},

 abstract = {In the MicroNet Challenge 2019, competitors attempted to design the neural network architecture with fewer resource budgets, e.g., the number of parameters and FLOPS. In this study, we describe the approaches of team KAIST, using which they won the second and third places, respectively, in the CIFAR-100 classification task in the contest. We solve the task into four steps. First, we design a novel baseline network appropriate for the CIFAR-100 dataset. Second, we train this network using our novel structural regularization methods, which penalize the orthogonality of weights and replace the ground-truth label of each data with a noise vector that has class-wise similarity information from the representative feature vectors of each class in the course of training. Third, we seek the most potent data-augmentation methods for significant improvements in accuracy. At last, we perform the sparse training via a pruning technique. Our final score is 0.0054, which represents 370x improvements over the baseline for the CIFAR-100 dataset. This is the only work that finished in the top 10 percent of both parameter storage and computation over the CIFAR-100 classification task.

 abstract = {Deep Neural Networks models are state-of-the-art solutions in accurately forecasting future video frames in a movie.  A successful video prediction model needs to extract and encode semantic features that describe the complex spatio-temporal correlations within image sequences of the real world.  The IARAI Traffic4cast Challenge of the NeurIPS Competition Track 2019 for the first time introduced the novel argument that this is also highly relevant for urban traffic. By framing traffic prediction as a movie completion task, the challenge requires models to take advantage of complex geo-spatial and temporal patterns of the underlying process. We here report on the success and insights obtained in a first Traffic Map Movie forecasting challenge. Although short-term traffic prediction is considered hard, this novel approach allowed several research groups to successfully predict future traffic states in a purely data-driven manner from pixel space. We here expand on the original rationale, summarize key findings, and discuss promising future directions of the t4c competition at NeurIPS.},

At the time of March 2020, the last challenge AutoDL is still on-going and we only present its design.  Some highlights of this work include: (1) a benchmark suite of baseline AutoML solutions, with emphasis on domains for which Deep Learning methods have had prior success (image, video, text, speech, etc); (2) a novel any-time learning framework, which opens doors for further theoretical consideration; (3) a repository of around 100 datasets (from all above domains) over half of which are released as public datasets to enable research on meta-learning; (4) analyses revealing that winning solutions generalize to new unseen datasets, validating progress towards universal AutoML solution; (5) open-sourcing of the challenge platform, the starting kit, the dataset formatting toolkit, and all winning solutions (All information available at {autodl.chalearn.org}).},

 abstract = {The 2019 IARAI traffic4cast competition is a traffic forecasting problem based on traffic data from three cities that are encoded as images. We developed a ResNet-inspired graph convolutional neural network (GCN) approach that uses street network-based subgraphs of the image lattice graphs as a prior. We train the Graph-ResNet together with GCN and convolutional neural network (CNN) benchmark models on Moscow traffic data and use them to first predict the traffic in Moscow and then to predict the traffic in Berlin and Istanbul. The results suggest that the graph-based models have superior generalization properties than CNN-based models for this application. We argue that in contrast to purely image-based approaches, formulating the prediction problem on a graph allows the neural network to learn properties given by the underlying street network. This facilitates the transfer of a learned network to predict the traffic status at unknown locations.},

We formulate a modular system composed of three layers: machine learning based perception, mapping and planning. Fundamental is a robust gate detection for target guidance accompanied with a monocular depth estimation for collision avoidance. The estimated targets are used to create and update the 3D gate positions within a map. Rule based trajectory planning is finally used for optimal flying. Our approach runs in real-time on a state of the art GPU and is able to robustly navigate through different simulated race tracks under challenging conditions, e.g. high speeds, confusing gate positioning and irregular shapes.Our approach ranks on the 3rd place on the final leader board.

 abstract = {Sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning methods is a major obstacle for their use in real-world applications. In this work, we show how human demonstrations can improve final performance of agents on the Minecraft minigame ObtainDiamond with only 8M frames of environment interaction. We propose a training procedure where policy networks are first trained on human data and later fine-tuned by reinforcement learning. Using a policy exploitation mechanism, experience replay and an additional loss against catastrophic forgetting, our best agent was able to achieve a mean score of 48. Our proposed solution placed 3rd in the NeurIPS MineRL Competition for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning.},

 abstract = {Drone racing has become one of the challenging topics in robotics and machine learning because such a drone requires to equip with high performing modules that carry out demanding tasks, such as obstacle avoidance, mapping, and planning. In addition, one of the most crucial aspects of the racing drone is its speed. However, this is the somewhat less studied area compared to conventional topics such as obstacle avoidance and path-finding, probably because designing a loss function for the speed optimization with the gradient-based method is difficult. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary scheme for optimizing the speed-related parameters for shortening the travel time rather than using the gradient-based loss for them. For the planning part, we use an online learning method with the racing parameter optimization. Therefore, our approach is to combine evolutionary algorithms for speed optimization and gradient-based online learning, achieving first place in Tier 2 and Tier 3 in Game of Drones competition at NeurIPS 2019. },

 abstract = {In this article, we describe the algorithms for causal structure learning from time series data that won the Causality 4 Climate competition at the Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems 2019 (NeurIPS). We examine how our combination of established ideas achieves competitive performance on semi-realistic and realistic time series data exhibiting common challenges in real-world Earth sciences data. In particular, we discuss a) a rationale for leveraging linear methods to identify causal links in non-linear systems, b) a simulation-backed explanation as to why large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small p-values and thus why normalising the data may sometimes hinder causal structure learning. For benchmark usage, we detail the algorithms here and provide implementations at this https URL . We propose the presented competition-proven methods for baseline benchmark comparisons to guide the development of novel algorithms for structure learning from time series.},

This paper documents our attempt to computationally model the creative process of a portrait painter, who relies on understanding human traits (i.e., personality and emotions) to inform their art. Our system includes an empathic conversational interaction component to capture the dominant personality category of the user and a generative AI Portraiture system that uses this categorization to create a personalized stylization of the user's portrait. This paper includes the description of our systems and the real-time interaction results obtained during the demonstration session of the NeurIPS 2019 Conference.},

 abstract = {It is important to design compact language models for efficient deployment. We improve upon recent advances in both the language modeling domain and the model-compression domain to construct parameter and computation efficient language models. We use an efficient transformer-based architecture with adaptive embedding and softmax, differentiable non-parametric cache, Hebbian softmax, knowledge distillation, network pruning, and low-bit quantization. In this paper, we provide the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2019 MicroNet Challenge in the language modeling track. Compared to the baseline language model provided by the MicroNet Challenge, our model is 90 times more parameter-efficient and 36 times more computation-efficient while achieving the required test perplexity of 35 on the Wikitext-103 dataset. We hope that this work will aid future research into efficient language models, and we have released our full source code at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/neurips-micronet.},
