  abstract = 	 {We investigate measures of the clusterability of data sets. Namely, ways to define how âstrongâ or âconclusiveâ is the clustering structure of a given data set. We address this issue with generality, aiming for conclusions that apply regardless of any particular clustering algorithm or any specific data generation  model.    We survey several notions of clusterability that have been discussed in the literature, as well as propose a new notion of data clusterability.    Our comparison of these notions reveals that, although they all attempt to evaluate the same intuitive property, they are pairwise inconsistent.    Our analysis discovers an interesting phenomenon; Although most of the common clustering tasks are NP-hard, finding a close-to-optimal clustering for well-clusterable data sets is easy (computationally). We prove instances of this general claim with respect to the various clusterability notions that we discuss.    Finally, we investigate how hard it is to determine the clusterability value of a given data set. In most cases, it turns out that this is an NP-hard problem.}

On the other hand, purely mechanistic approaches  need to identify and specify all the interactions in the problem at hand (which  may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes and differential equations to combine data driven modeling with a physical model of the system. We show how different, physically-inspired, kernel functions  can be developed through sensible, simple, mechanistic assumptions about the underlying system. The versatility of our approach is illustrated with three case studies from computational biology, motion capture and geostatistics.}

We accomplish this through hierarchical modeling of such priors. Although the mixing distribution is not explicitly stated for scale normal mixtures, we obtain the required moments only to attain the variational distributions for the regression coefficients. By choosing specific values of hyper-parameters (tuning parameters) present in the model, we can mimic the model selection performance of best subset selection in sparse underlying settings. The fundamental difference between MAP, maximum a posteriori, estimation and the proposed method is that, here we can obtain approximate inferences besides a point estimator. We also empirically analyze the frequentist properties of the estimator obtained. Results suggest that the proposed method yields an estimator that performs significantly better in sparse underlying setups than the existing state-of-the-art procedures in both n>p and p>n scenarios.}

Technically this reduces to learning a probabilistic, input conditional model, over latent (manifold) and output variables using an alternation scheme. In one round, we optimize the parameters of an input-driven manifold predictor using latent targets given by preimages (conditional expectations) of the current manifold-to-output model. In the next round, we use the distribution given by the manifold predictor in order to maximize the probability of the outputs with an additional, implicit distance preserving constraint on the manifold. The resulting Supervised Spectral Latent Variable Model (SSLVM) combines the properties of probabilistic geometric manifold learning (accommodates geometric constraints corresponding to any spectral embedding method including PCA, ISOMAP or Laplacian Eigenmaps), with the additional supervisory information to further constrain it for predictive tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of the method over baseline PPCA + regression frameworks and show its potential in difficult realworld computer vision benchmarks designed for the reconstruction of three-dimensional human poses from monocular image sequences.}

Whereas standard approaches simply minimize Shannonâs entropy of the estimated parameter posterior, we show how to select between alternative model configurations, too. Our method specifies the intervention that makes an experiment capable of determining whether or not a particular configuration hypothesis is correct. This is performed by a novel clustering technique in approximated Bayesian parameter estimation for non-linear dynamical systems. The computation of the perturbation that minimizes the effective number of clusters in the belief state is constrained by the increase of the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the parameter prior and the posterior. This enables the disambiguation of persisting alternative explanations in cases where standard design systematically fails. Its applicability is illustrated with a biochemical Goodwin model, showing correct identification between multiple kinetic structures. We expect that our approach will prove useful especially for complex structures with reduced observability and multimodal posteriors.}

Specifically, we use a Gaussian distribution over weight vectors with   mean and covariance parameters that are learned from the training data. The learning algorithm seeks for a distribution with a small Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from a   ï¬xed isotropic distribution, such that each training example is correctly classified by a strict majority of the weight   vectors.

In this paper, we propose a method for  learning an attractive class of models: bounded treewidth  junction trees. Those models permit  both compact representation of probability distributions  and efficient exact inference.  Our method uses a new global criterion to construct  the tree. Our criterion, based on a Bethe  approximation of the likelihood, transforms the  structure learning problem into an intuitive graph  theoretical task.  We present an efficient randomized algorithm  with theoretical guarantees for finding good separators.  We recursively apply this procedure to  obtain a thin junction tree. Our extensive empirical  evaluation demonstrates the benefit of applying  exact inference using our models to answer  queries. We also extend our technique to learn  low tree-width conditional random fields, and  demonstrate significant improvements over state  of the art block-L1 regularization techniques.}

Our algorithm  is an approximate version of Cutset  Conditioning, in which a set of variables is  instantiated to make the rest of the graph  singly connected. We relax the constraint  of single-connectedness, and select variables  one at a time for conditioning, running belief  propagation after each selection. We consider  the problem of determining the best variable  to clamp at each level of recursion, and  propose a fast heuristic which applies backpropagation  to the BP updates. We demonstrate  that the heuristic performs better than  selecting variables at random, and give experimental  results which show that it performs  competitively with existing approximate inference  algorithms.}

Answering these questions is important if learning in deep architectures is to be further improved. We attempt to shed some light on these questions through extensive simulations. The experiments confirm and clarify the advantage of unsupervised pre-training. They demonstrate the robustness of the training procedure with respect to the random initialization, the positive  effect of pre-training in terms of optimization and its role as a kind of regularizer.

We formalize this observation and use it to devise a sequential selective sensing strategy that focuses sensing/measurement resources towards the signal subspace.  This adaptivity in sensing results in rather surprising gains in sparse signal recovery compared to non-adaptive sensing.  We show that exponentially weaker sparse signals can be recovered via DS compared with conventional non-adaptive sensing.}

However, many questions remain open about the behavior of particleâbased BP algorithms, and little theory has been developed to analyze their performance. In this paper, we describe a generic particle belief propagation (PBP) algorithm which is closely related to previously proposed methods.  We prove that this algorithm is consistent, approaching the true BP messages as the number of samples grows large. We then use concentration bounds to analyze the finite-sample behavior and give a convergence rate for the algorithm on treeâstructured graphs. Our convergence rate is $O(1/\sqrt{n})$ where n is the number of samples, independent of the domain size of the variables.}

Competitive imperfect information games where the goal is to maximally exploit an unknown opponentâs weaknesses are an example of this problem.  Agents for these games must balance two objectives.  First, they should aim to exploit data from past interactions with the opponent, seeking a best-response counter strategy.  Second, they should aim to minimize losses since the limited data may be misleading or the opponentâs strategy may have changed, suggesting an opponent-agnostic Nash equilibrium strategy.  In this paper, we show how to partially satisfy both of these objectives at the same time, producing strategies with favorable tradeoffs between the ability to exploit an opponent and the capacity to be exploited.  Like a recently published technique, our approach involves solving a modified game; however the result is more generally applicable and even performs well in situations with very limited data.  We evaluate our technique in the game of two-player, Limit Texas Holdâem.}

In the full-observation (experts) version of the problem, we present an exponential-weights algorithm that achieves regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log n})$, which is the best possible. For the bandit setting (where the algorithm only observes the reward of the action selected), we present a no-regret algorithm based on follow-the-perturbed-leader. This algorithm runs in polynomial time, unlike the EXP4 algorithm which can also be applied to this setting. Our algorithm has the interesting interpretation of solving a geometric experts problem where the embedding in which rewards are linear is never explicitly constructed. We argue that this adversarial-reward, stochastic availability formulation is important in practice, as assuming stationary stochastic rewards is unrealistic in many domains.}

The problem is often treated as a regression task where the goal is to find a low dimensional representation of the input data that preserves the statistical correlation with the targets. Recently, Covariance Operator Inverse Regression (COIR) was proposed as an effective solution that exploits the covariance structures of both input and output. COIR addresses known limitations of recent DRR techniques and allows a closed-form solution without resorting to explicit output space slicing often required by existing IR-based methods. In this work we provide a unifying view of COIR and other DRR techniques and relate them to the popular supervised dimensionality reduction methods including the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and the linear discriminant analysis (LDA). We then show that COIR can be effectively extended to a semi-supervised learning setting where many of the input points lack their corresponding multivariate targets. A study of benefits of proposed approaches is presented on several important regression problems in both fully-supervised and semi-supervised settings.}

  abstract = 	 {The runtime for Kernel Partial Least Squares (KPLS) to compute the fit is quadratic in the number of examples. However, the necessity of obtaining sensitivity measures as degrees of freedom for model selection or confidence intervals for more detailed analysis requires cubic runtime, and thus constitutes  a computational bottleneck in real-world data analysis. We propose a novel algorithm for KPLS which not only computes (a) the fit, but also (b) its approximate degrees of freedom and (c) error bars in quadratic runtime. The algorithm exploits a close connection between Kernel PLS and the Lanczos algorithm for approximating the eigenvalues of symmetric matrices, and uses this approximation to compute the trace of powers of the kernel matrix in quadratic runtime.}

Often, off-the-shelf software is invoked for the associated optimization, which can be inappropriate due to excessive computational and storage requirements.  In this paper, we introduce the use of convex perturbations for solving semidefinite programs (SDPs), and for a specific perturbation we derive an algorithm that has several advantages over existing techniques: a) it is simple, requiring only a few lines of Matlab, b) it is a first-order method, and thereby scalable, and c) it can easily exploit the structure of a given SDP (e.g., when the constraint matrices are low-rank, a situation common to several machine learning SDPs). A pleasant byproduct of our method is a fast, kernelized version of the large-margin nearest neighbor metric learning algorithm.  We demonstrate that our algorithm is effective in finding fast approximations to large-scale SDPs arising in some machine learning applications.}

Although many efficient approaches have been proposed to  alleviate the computational burden of SDP, convex MMCs are still not  scalable for medium data sets.

Our empirical results show that the exercise policies discovered by LSPI and FQI gain larger payoffs than those discovered by LSM, on both real and synthetic data. Furthermore, we find that for all methods the policies learned from real data generally gain similar payoffs to the policies learned from simulated data.

To circumvent  this difficulty, this paper proposes to learn  the network structure using an ensemble-of-trees  (ET) model. The ET model was first introduced  by Meila and Jaakkola [1], and it approximates  a Markov network using a mixture of all possible  (super-exponentially many) spanning trees.  The advantage of the ET model is that, although  it needs to sum over super-exponentially many  trees, its partition function as well as data likelihood  can be computed in a closed form. Furthermore,  since the ET model tends to represent  a Markov network using as small number  of trees as possible, it provides a natural regularization  for finding a sparse network structure.  Our simulation results show that the proposed  ET approach is able to accurately recover  the true Markov network connectivity and significantly  outperform the state-of-art approaches  for both discrete and continuous random variable  networks. Furthermore, we also demonstrate the  usage of the ET model for discovering the network  of words from blog posts.}

Stating    generalization bounds for such frameworks is therefore of the utmost    interest, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. In this work, we propose the first âÂ to the best of our knowledgeÂ â  PAC-Bayes generalization bounds for classifiers trained on data    exhibiting dependencies. The approach undertaken to establish our    results is based on the decomposition of a so-called dependency    graph that encodes the dependencies within the data, in sets of    independent data, through the tool of graph fractional covers.  Our    bounds are very general, since being able to find an upper bound on    the (fractional) chromatic number of the dependency graph is    sufficient to get new PAC-Bayes bounds for specific settings. We show how our results can be used to derive bounds for bipartite    ranking and windowed prediction on sequential data.}

Unfortunately, such inverse optimal control methods rely upon the ability to   efficiently solve a planning problem and suffer from the usual âcurse of  dimensionalityâ when the state space gets large. This paper presents a novel  approach to imitation learning that we call Inverse Optimal Heuristic Control (IOHC) which capitalizes on the strengths of both paradigms by  allowing long-horizon, planning style reasoning in a low dimensional space,  while enabling a high dimensional additional set of features to guide overall  action selection.  We frame this combined problem as one of optimization, and  although the resulting objective function is actually non-convex, we are able  to provide convex upper and lower bounds to optimize as surrogates. Further,  these bounds, as well as our empirical results, show that the objective   function is nearly convex and leads to improved performance on a set of  imitation learning problems including turn prediction of drivers as well as  predicting the likely paths taken by pedestrians in an office environment.}

If the final number of outcomes $T$ is known in advance, then the switching rate can be learned with regret $\frac{1}{2} \log T + O(1)$ bits. The current fastest method that  achieves this, Learn-alpha, is based on optimal  discretisation of the Bernoulli distributions into $O(\sqrt{T})$ bins and runs in $(T\sqrt{T})$ time; however the exact locations of these points  have to be determined algorithmically.    This paper introduces a new discretisation  scheme with the same regret bound for  known $T$, that specifies the number and positions of the discretisation points explicitly. The scheme is especially useful when $T$ is not known in advance: a new fully online algorithm, Refine-Online, is presented, which  runs in $O(T \sqrt{T} \log T)$ time and achieves a  regret of $\frac{1}{2} \log 3 \log T + O(\log \log T)$ bits.}

We propose an intermediate approach where we learn these classifiers in a sequence using previously learned classifiers to guide learning of the next classifier by enforcing constraints between their outputs. We provide a theoretical motivation to explain why this learning protocol is expected to outperform both alternatives when individual problems have different âcomplexityâ. This analysis motivates an algorithm for choosing a preferred order of classifier learning.

The standard (inductive) approach to this problem has been to  declare novelties where the nominal density is low, which reduces the  problem to density level set estimation. In this paper, we consider the  setting where an unlabeled and possibly contaminated sample is also  available at learning time. We argue that novelty detection is naturally  solved by a general reduction to a binary classification problem. In  particular, a detector with a desired false positive rate can be achieved  through a reduction to Neyman-Pearson classification. Unlike the inductive  approach, our approach yields detectors that are optimal (e.g.,  statistically consistent) regardless of the distribution on novelties.  Therefore, in novelty detection, unlabeled data have a substantial impact  on the theoretical properties of the decision rule.}

  abstract = 	 {The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we present a general formulation for reaping the benefits from both non-negative data factorization and semi-supervised learning, and the solution naturally possesses the characteristics of sparsity, robustness to partial occlusions, and greater discriminating power via extra unlabeled data. Then, an efficient multiplicative updating procedure is proposed along with its theoretic justification of the algorithmic convergency. Finally, the tensorization of this general formulation for non-negative semi-supervised learning is also briefed for handling tensor data of arbitrary order. Extensive experiments compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms for non-negative data factorization and semi-supervised learning demonstrate the algorithmic properties in sparsity, classification power, and robustness to image occlusions.}

The key idea is to  construct two kernel matrices for the given training data: one is  based on the distance metric and the other is based on the assigned  class labels. Inspired by the idea of information geometry, we  relate these two kernel matrices to two Gaussian distributions, and  the difference between the two kernel matrices is then computed by  the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two Gaussian  distributions. The optimal distance metric is then found by  minimizing the divergence between the two distributions. Based on  this idea, we present two metric learning algorithms, one for linear  distance metric and the other for nonlinear distance with the  introduction of a kernel function. Unlike many existing algorithms  for metric learning that require solving a non-trivial optimization  problem and therefore are computationally expensive when the data  dimension is high, the proposed algorithms have a closed-form  solution and are computationally more efficient. Extensive  experiments with data classification and face recognition show that  the proposed algorithms are comparable to or better than the  state-of-the-art algorithms for metric learning.}

The maximum margin separation between the correct multilabels and the incorrect ones is formulated as a linear program.  Instead of explicitly writing out the entire problem with an exponentially large  constraint set, the linear program is solved iteratively via column generation. In this case, the process of generating most violated constraints is equivalent to searching for highest-scored misclassified incorrect multilabels, which can be easily achieved by decoding the structure based on current estimations.  In addition, we also explore the integration of the column generation and the extragradient method for linear programming to gain further efficiency. Compared to previous works on large-margin structured prediction, this framework has advantages in handling arbitrary structures and larger-scale  problems. Experimental results on part-of-speech tagging and statistical machine translation tasks are reported, demonstrating the competitiveness of the proposed approach.}

Intuitively this sharing results in the âadaptationâ of a latent shared language model to each domain. We introduce a general formalism capable of describing the overall model which we call the graphical Pitman-Yor process and explain how to perform Bayesian inference in it. We present encouraging language model domain adaptation results that both illustrate the potential benefits of our new model and suggest new avenues of inquiry.}

Moreover, Rosset et al. have shown that for separable data, standard $l_p$ regularized loss minimization results in a margin maximizing classifier in the limit as regularization is relaxed. For the case $p=1$, we extend these results by obtaining explicit convergence bounds on the regularization required to yield a margin within prescribed accuracy of the maximum achievable margin. We derive similar rates of convergence for the $\epsilon$-AdaBoost algorithm, in the process providing a new proof that $\epsilon$-AdaBoost is margin maximizing as $\epsilon$ converges to $0$. Because both of these known algorithms are computationally expensive, we introduce a new hybrid algorithm, AdaBoost+$L_1$, that combines the virtues of AdaBoost with the sparsity of $l_1$ regularization in a computationally efficient fashion. We prove that the algorithm is margin maximizing and empirically examine its performance on five datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a widely used model for clustering and for general nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Unfortunately, like in many statistical models, exact inference in a DPM is intractable, and  approximate methods are needed to perform efficient inference. While most attention in the literature has been placed on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), variational Bayesian (VB) and collapsed variational methods, Heller and Ghahramani (2005) recently introduced a novel class of approximation for DPMs based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering (BHC). These tree-based combinatorial approximations efficiently sum over exponentially many ways of partitioning the data and offer a novel lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the DPM. In this paper we make the following contributions: (1) We show empirically that the BHC lower bounds are substantially tighter than the bounds given by VB and by collapsed variational methods on synthetic and real datasets. (2) We also show that BHC offers a more accurate predictive performance on these datasets. (3) We further improve the tree-based lower bounds with an algorithm that efficiently sums contributions from alternative trees. (4) We present a fast approximate method for BHC. Our results suggest that our combinatorial approximate inference methods and lower bounds may be useful not only in DPMs but in other models as well.}

The strength of this model is that one actively sensed (sample, view) pair would improve the joint multi-view  classification on all the samples. For this purpose we extend the  Bayesian co-training framework such that it can handle missing views  in a principled way, and introduce two criteria for view acquisition.  Experiments on one toy data and two real-world medical problems show  the effectiveness of this model.}

However, extension of such methods from the binary classification setting to the more general multicategory setting turns out to be non-trivial. In this paper, our focus is to devise margin-based classification methods that can be seamlessly applied to both settings, with the binary setting simply as a special case. In particular, we propose a new majorization loss function that we call the coherence function, and then devise a new multicategory margin-based boosting algorithm based on the coherence function. Analogous to deterministic annealing, the coherence function is characterized by a temperature factor. It is closely related to the multinomial log-likelihood function and its limit at zero temperature corresponds to a multicategory hinge loss function.}

A comparative analysis is provided with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and model selection employing estimates of the marginal likelihood. An illustrative synthetic example is provided using blind mixtures of images. This is then followed by a large scale study of the recovery of component spectra  from multiplexed Raman readouts. The power and flexibility of the Bayesian methodology and the proposed RJMCMC procedure to objectively assess  differing model structures and infer the corresponding plausible component spectra for this complex data is demonstrated convincingly.}
