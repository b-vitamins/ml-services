 abstract = {Blood glucose value prediction is an important task in diabetes management. While it is reported that glucose concentration is sensitive to social context such as mood, physical activity, stress, diet, alongside the influence of diabetes pathologies, we need more research on data and methodologies to incorporate and evaluate signals about such temporal context into prediction models. Person-generated data sources, such as actively contributed surveys as well as passively mined data from social media offer opportunity to capture such context, however the self-reported nature and sparsity of such data mean that such data are noisier and less specific than physiological measures such as blood glucose values themselves. Therefore, here we propose a Gaussian Process model to both address these data challenges and combine blood glucose and latent feature representations of contextual data for a novel multi-signal blood glucose prediction task. We find this approach outperforms common methods for multi-variate data, as well as using the blood glucose values in isolation. Given a robust evaluation across two blood glucose datasets with different forms of contextual information, we conclude that multi-signal Gaussian Processes can improve blood glucose prediction by using contextual information and may provide a significant shift in blood glucose prediction research and practice.},

 abstract = {Sleep staging is a crucial task for diagnosing sleep disorders. It is tedious and complex as it can take a trained expert several hours to annotate just one patient's polysomnogram (PSG) from a single night. Although deep learning models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in automating sleep staging, interpretability which defines other desiderata, has largely remained unexplored. In this study, we propose Sleep staging via Prototypes from Expert Rules (SLEEPER), which combines deep learning models with expert defined rules using a prototype learning framework to generate simple interpretable models. In particular, SLEEPER utilizes sleep scoring rules and expert defined features to derive prototypes which are embeddings of PSG data fragments via convolutional neural networks. The final models are simple interpretable models like a shallow decision tree defined over those phenotypes. We evaluated SLEEPER using two PSG datasets collected from sleep studies and demonstrated that SLEEPER could provide accurate sleep stage classification comparable to human experts and deep neural networks with about 85% ROC-AUC and .7 kappa.},

 abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is widely used in hospitals and clinics for the diagnosis of many neurological conditions. Such diagnoses require accurate and timely clinical reports to summarize the findings from raw EEG data. In this paper, we investigate whether it is possible to automatically generate text reports directly from EEG data. To address the challenges, we proposed EEGtoText , which first extracted shift invariant and temporal patterns using stacked convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks (RCNN). These temporal patterns are used to classify key phenotypes including EEG normality, sleep, generalized and focal slowing, epileptiform discharges, spindles, vertex waves and seizures. Based on these phenotypes, the impression section of the EEG report is generated. Next, we adopted a hierarchical long short-term memory network(LSTM) that comprises of paragraph-level and sentence-level LSTMs to generate the detail explanation of the impression. Within the hierarchical LSTM, we used an attention module to localize the abnormal areas in the EEG which provide another explanation and justification of the extracted phenotypes. We conducted large-scale evaluations on two different EEG datasets Dataset1 (n=12,980) and TUH (n=16,950). We achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) between .658 to .915 on phenotype classification, which is significantly higher than CRNN and RCNN with attention. We also conducted a quantitative evaluation of the detailed explanation, which achieved METEOR score .371 and BLEU score 4.583. Finally, our initial clinical reviews confirmed the effectiveness of the generated reports.},

 abstract = {Seizure detection from EEGs is a challenging and time consuming clinical problem that would benefit from the development of automated algorithms. EEGs can be viewed as structural time series, because they are multivariate time series where the placement of leads on a patient's scalp provides prior information about the structure of interactions. Commonly used deep learning models for time series don't offer a way to leverage structural information, but this would be desirable in a model for structural time series. To address this challenge, we propose the temporal graph convolutional network (TGCN), a model that leverages structural information and has relatively few parameters. TGCNs apply feature extraction operations that are localized and shared over both time and space, thereby providing a useful inductive bias in tasks where one expects similar features to be discriminative across the different sequences. In our experiments we focus on metrics that are most important to seizure detection, and demonstrate that TGCN matches the performance of related models that have been shown to be state of the art in other tasks. Additionally, we investigate interpretability advantages of TGCN by exploring approaches for helping clinicians determine when precisely seizures occur, and the parts of the brain that are most involved.},

The state-of-the-art work in this area proposes models that forecast by using latent representations extracted from the longitudinal data across multiple modalities, including volumetric information extracted from medical scans and demographic info. These models incorporate the time horizon, which is the amount of time between the last recorded visit and the future visit, by directly concatenating a representation of it to the data latent representation. In this paper, we present a model which generates a sequence of latent representations of the patient status across the time horizon, providing more informative modeling of the temporal relationships between the patient's history and future visits. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline in terms of forecasting accuracy and F1 score with the added benefit of robustly handling missing visits.},

 abstract = {We consider preoperative prediction of thyroid cancer based on ultra-high-resolution whole-slide cytopathology images. Inspired by how human experts perform diagnosis, our approach first identifies and classifies diagnostic image regions containing informative thyroid cells, which only comprise a tiny fraction of the entire image. These local estimates are then aggregated into a single prediction of thyroid malignancy. Several unique characteristics of thyroid cytopathology guide our deep-learning-based approach. While our method is closely related to multiple-instance learning, it deviates from these methods by using a supervised procedure to extract diagnostically relevant regions. Moreover, we propose to simultaneously predict thyroid malignancy, as well as a diagnostic score assigned by a human expert, which further allows us to devise an improved training strategy. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves performance comparable to human experts, and demonstrate the potential of using the algorithm for screening and as an assistive tool for the improved diagnosis of indeterminate cases.},

 abstract = {Reducing patientsâ medical wait times by improving resource and staffing allocation is an important area of focus in hospital operations management. Two ways to decrease wait times are to adjust staffing or to limit the number of non-urgent visits to reflect a predicted volume of sick patients. Currently, this problem has been approached by both generalized linear models and time series models, and has mainly been researched in the context of adult emergency departments. We analyze sick visit data over a nine year period from one pediatric group (PG) that serves over 30,000 sick infants, children, and adolescents yearly in a walk-in and appointment-based out-patient clinic. The PG currently schedules staff and well-child appointments assuming a constant number of sick visits daily despite weekly and seasonal cycles in the data. We develop time series models to estimate the volume of sick patients that the PG can expect on any given day, so that clinicians can be allocated and the number of well-child appointments scheduled in advance can be adjusted according to predictions. First, we find that recurrent neural network (RNN) models are able to capture the seasonality of the data and perform substantially better than state-of-the-art models, including constant predictions. Next, we find that previous daysâ data can be used to perform outbreak detection by identifying error outliers. Lastly, we find improvements in prediction when modeling sick patients as a mixture of disease types, because disease types are concentrated differently throughout the year. Resource allocation based on these findings can be expanded upon to reduce wait time by improving staffing at pediatric emergency departments and outpatient clinics.},

Accurately predicting rehabilitation outcome is crucial for treatment decision support. However, it is challenging to train an automatic method for predicting the ATR rehabilitation outcome from treatment data, due to a massive amount of missing entries in the data recorded from ATR patients, as well as complex nonlinear relations between measurements and outcomes. In this work, we design an end-to-end probabilistic framework to impute missing data entries and predict rehabilitation outcomes simultaneously. We evaluate our model on a real-life ATR clinical cohort, comparing with various baselines. The proposed method demonstrates its clear superiority over traditional methods which typically perform imputation and prediction in two separate stages.},

 abstract = {Brief, intense exercise can improve health due to its acute effect on the autonomic nervous system, particularly the sympathetic nervous system. Salivary amylase is a marker of sympathetic activity during exercise, but it requires specialized equipment to measure. We investigate the feasibility of estimating the amylase response from heartbeat data recorded by commodity sensors. We collect heartbeat and amylase data for n = 71 sessions of intense exercise performed in a commercial setting. Our machine learning model exploits structure in the heartbeat signal: by identifying and removing the contribution of the parasympathetic nervous system, we obtain a residual with sympathetic information, to which we apply a convolutional neural network. This model has better accuracy than existing measures of exercise response, such as maximum heart rate, even though it doesnât use metadata such as age and gender. This suggests sympathetic activity may be (weakly) discerned from heartbeat data. With a larger dataset, a practical measure of sympathetic response to exercise could potentially be developed. Our quantification of parasympathetic activity is more powerful than existing approaches and may have independent value.},

 abstract = {Early prediction of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias may facilitate earlier access to medical and social supports. Further, detection of individuals with preclinical disease may help to enrich clinical trial populations for studies examining disease-modifying interventions. Changes in speech and language patterns may occur in the early stages of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and frontotemporal dementia, with worsening as the disease progresses. This has led to recent attempts to create automatic methods that predict cognitive impairment and dementia through language analysis. Previous works have improved the prediction accuracy by introducing some task-specific features in addition to task-agnostic linguistic and acoustic features. However, task-specific features prevent the model from generalizing to other tests and languages. In this paper, we focus on exploring the effectiveness of neural network models that require no task-specific feature for dementia prediction in three different ways. First, we use a multimodal neural model to fuse linguistic features and acoustic features, and investigate the performance change compared to simply concatenating these features. Second, we propose a novel coherence feature generated by a neural coherence model, and investigate the predictiveness of this new feature for dementia prediction. Finally, we apply an end-to-end neural method which is free from feature engineering and achieves state-of-the-art classification result on a widely used dementia dataset.},

Common selection heuristics are formulas expressed in terms of the durations required to reach various developmental milestones, quantities historically annotated manually by experienced embryologists based on time-lapse EmbryoScope videos. We propose a new method for automatic embryo staging that exploits several sources of structure in this time-lapse data. First, noting that in each image the embryo occupies a small subregion, we jointly train a region proposal network with the downstream classifier to isolate the embryo. Notably, because we lack ground-truth bounding boxes, our we weakly supervise the region proposal network optimizing its parameters via reinforcement learning to improve the downstream classifier's loss. Moreover, noting that embryos reaching the blastocyst stage progress monotonically through earlier stages, we develop a dynamic-programming-based decoder that post-processes our predictions to select the most likely monotonic sequence of developmental stages. Our methods outperform vanilla residual networks and rival the best numbers in contemporary papers, as measured by both per-frame accuracy and transition prediction error, despite operating on smaller data than many.},

 abstract = {Given the crucial role of microtubules for cell survival, many researchers have found success using microtubule-targeting agents in the search for effective cancer therapeutics. Understanding microtubule responses to targeted interventions requires that the microtubule network within cells can be consistently observed across a large sample of images. However, fluorescence noise sources captured simultaneously with biological signals while using wide-field microscopes can obfuscate fine microtubule structures. Such requirements are particularly challenging for high-throughput imaging, where researchers must make decisions related to the trade-off between imaging quality and speed. Here, we propose a computational framework to enhance the quality of high-throughput imaging data to achieve fast speed and high quality simultaneously. Using CycleGAN, we learn an image model from low-throughput, high-resolution images to enhance features, such as microtubule networks in high-throughput low-resolution images. We show that CycleGAN is effective in identifying microtubules with 0.93+ AUC-ROC and that these results are robust to different kinds of image noise. We further apply CycleGAN to quantify the changes in microtubule density as a result of the application of drug compounds, and show that the quantified responses correspond well with known drug effects},

While recent work has shown that body-worn sensors can be used to identify meal times, to have an impact on health and fully replace manual food logs, we need to identify not only when someone is eating, but what they are consuming. However, it is challenging to collect labeled data in daily life, while lab data does not always generalize to reality. To address this, we develop new algorithms for semi-supervised hierarchical classification that enable higher accuracy when training on data with weak labels. Using this approach, we present the first results on automated classification of foods consumed in data collected from body-worn audio and motion sensors in free-living environments. We show that by exploiting a mix of lab and free-living data, we can achieve a classification accuracy of 88% on unrestricted meals (e.g. stir fry, pizza, salad) in unrestricted environments such as home and restaurants. Ultimately, this lays the foundation for body-worn devices that can calculate calories and macronutrients by identifying food type and quantity.},

This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early detection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner based on time series distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional network that is embedded in a Multi-task Gaussian Process Adapter framework, making it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. Our lazy learner, by contrast, is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time warping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series classification task. For this, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in an hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis detection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve area under the precision--recall curve from 0.25 to 0.35/0.40 over the state of the art. This demonstrates that they are well-suited for detecting sepsis in the crucial earlier stages when management is most effective.},

 abstract = {Glaucoma is the second leading global cause of blindness and its effects are irreversible, making early intervention crucial. The identification of glaucoma progression is therefore a challenging and important task. In this work, we model and predict longitudinal glaucoma measurements using an interpretable, discrete state space model. Two common glaucoma biomarkers are the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and the visual eld index (VFI). Prior works have frequently used a scalar representation for RNFL, such as the average RNFL thickness, thereby discarding potentially-useful spatial information. We present a technique for incorporating spatiotemporal RNFL thickness measurements obtained from a sequence of OCT images into a longitudinal progression model. While these images capture the details of RNFL thickness, representing them for use in a longitudinal model poses two challenges: First, spatial changes in RNFL thickness must be encoded and organized into a temporal sequence in order to enable state space modeling. Second, a predictive model for forecasting the pattern of changes over time must be developed. We address these challenges through a novel approach to spatiotemporal progression analysis. We jointly model the change in RNFL with VFI using a CT-HMM and predict future measurements. We achieve a decrease in mean absolute error of 74% for spatial RNFL thickness encoding in comparison to prior work using the average RNFL thickness. This work will be useful for accurately predicting the spatial location and intensity of tissue degeneration. Appropriate intervention based on more accurate prediction can potentially help to improve the clinical care of glaucoma.},

In this paper, we describe a model that allows rapid detection of the onset of hemorrhage by monitoring the Central Venous Pressure (CVP). As opposed to prior work in the domain, our model does not rely on prior availability of a stable physiology of a patient as a baseline of reference, and it makes generative assumptions on the monitored vital sign. This allows for rapid on-the-fly personalization to a previously unseen patient's physiology. This property makes the proposed approach particularly relevant to e.g. trauma care and other scenarios where reference hemodynamic data may not be readily available for any new patient. We compare our model against strong discriminative alternatives and demonstrate its potential utility through empirical evaluation.},

 abstract = {When training clinical prediction models from electronic health records (EHRs), a key concern should be a model's ability to sustain performance over time when deployed, even as care practices, database systems, and population demographics evolve. Due to de-identification requirements, however, current experimental practices for public EHR benchmarks (such as the MIMIC-III critical care dataset) are time agnostic, assigning care records to train or test sets without regard for the actual dates of care. As a result, current benchmarks cannot assess how well models trained on one year generalise to another. In this work, we obtain a Limited Data Use Agreement to access year of care for each record in MIMIC and show that all tested state-of-the-art models decay in prediction quality when trained on historical data and tested on future data, particularly in response to a system-wide record-keeping change in 2008 (0.29 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.10 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction with a random forest classifier). We further develop a simple yet effective mitigation strategy: by aggregating raw features into expert-defined clinical concepts, we see only a 0.06 drop in AUROC for mortality prediction and a 0.03 drop in AUROC for length-of-stay prediction. We demonstrate that this aggregation strategy outperforms other automatic feature preprocessing techniques aimed at increasing robustness to data drift. We release our aggregated representations and code to encourage more deployable clinical prediction models.},

 abstract = {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly applied to clinical time-series data with the goal of learning patient risk stratification models. Their effectiveness is due, in part, to their use of parameter sharing over time (i.e., cells are repeated hence the name recurrent). We hypothesize, however, that this trait also contributes to the increased difficulty such models have with learning relationships that change over time. Conditional shift, i.e., changes in the relationship between the input X and the output y, arises when risk factors associated with the event of interest change over the course of a patient admission. While in theory, RNNs and gated RNNs (e.g., LSTMs) in particular should be capable of learning time-varying relationships, when training data are limited, such models often fail to accurately capture these dynamics. We illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of complete parameter sharing (RNNs) by comparing an LSTM with shared parameters to a sequential architecture with time-varying parameters on prediction tasks involving three clinically-relevant outcomes: acute respiratory failure (ARF), shock, and in-hospital mortality. In experiments using synthetic data, we demonstrate how parameter sharing in LSTMs leads to worse performance in the presence of conditional shift. To improve upon the dichotomy between complete parameter sharing and no parameter sharing, we propose a novel RNN formulation based on a mixture model in which we relax parameter sharing over time. The proposed method outperforms standard LSTMs and other state-of-the-art baselines across all tasks. In settings with limited data, relaxed parameter sharing can lead to improved patient risk stratification performance.},

 abstract = {Recently, researchers have started training high complexity machine learning models to clinical tasks, often improving upon previous benchmarks. However, more often than not, these methods require large amounts of supervision to provide good generalization guarantees. When applied to data coming from small cohorts and long monitoring periods these models are prone to overfit to subject-identifying features. Since obtaining large amounts of labels is usually not practical in many scenarios, expert-driven knowledge of the task is a common technique to prevent overfitting. We present a two-step learning approach that is able to generalize under these circumstances when applied to a voice monitoring dataset. Our approach decouples the feature learning stage and performs it in an unsupervised manner, removing the need for laborious feature engineering. We show the effectiveness of our proposed model on two voice monitoring related tasks. We evaluate the extracted features for classifying between patients with vocal fold nodules and controls. We also demonstrate that the features capture pathology relevant information by showing that models trained on them are more accurate predicting vocal use for patients than for controls. Our proposed method is able to generalize to unseen subjects and across learning tasks while matching state-of-the-art results.},

 abstract = {The use of machine learning systems to support decision making in healthcare raises questions as to what extent these systems may introduce or exacerbate disparities in care for historically underrepresented and mistreated groups, due to biases implicitly embedded in observational data in electronic health records. To address this problem in the context of clinical risk prediction models, we develop an augmented counterfactual fairness criteria to extend the group fairness criteria of equalized odds to an individual level. We do so by requiring that the same prediction be made for a patient, and a counterfactual patient resulting from changing a sensitive attribute, if the factual and counterfactual outcomes do not differ. We investigate the extent to which the augmented counterfactual fairness criteria may be applied to develop fair models for prolonged inpatient length of stay and mortality with observational electronic health records data. As the fairness criteria is ill-defined without knowledge of the data generating process, we use a variational autoencoder to perform counterfactual inference in the context of an assumed causal graph. While our technique provides a means to trade off maintenance of fairness with reduction in predictive performance in the context of a learned generative model, further work is needed to assess the generality of this approach.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of clinical image classification for the purpose of aiding doctors in dermatological disease diagnosis. Diagnosis of dermatological conditions from images poses two major challenges for standard off-the-shelf techniques: First, the distribution of real-world dermatological datasets is typically long-tailed. Second, intra-class variability is large. To address the first issue, we formulate the problem as low-shot learning, where once deployed, a base classifier must rapidly generalize to diagnose novel conditions given very few labeled examples. To model intra-class variability effectively, we propose Prototypical Clustering Networks (PCN), an extension to Prototypical Networks [26] that learns a mixture of “prototypes” for each class. Prototypes are initialized for each class via clustering and refined via an online update scheme. Classification is performed by measuring similarity to a weighted combination of prototypes within a class, where the weights are the inferred cluster responsibilities. We demonstrate the strengths of our approach in effective diagnosis on a realistic dataset of dermatological conditions.4},

First, an individual trough pharmacokinetic concentration (Ctrough) model is developed to predict the trough pharmacokinetic concentration for a potentially new treatment regime planned for Phase 3. Second, an individual treatment effect model is built to model the relationship between patient baseline characteristics, Ctrough and clinical outcomes. These two models are combined together to predict Phase 3 clinical trial results. Since the clinical outcomes to be predicted are longitudinal and the predictors are a mix of time-invariant and time-variant variables, a novel neural network, Residual Semi-Recurrent Neural Network, is developed for both models.

We start by training a population-level model using multi-modal data from previously seen subjects using a base Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Then, we personalize this model by adapting the base GP sequentially over time to a new (target) subject using domain adaptive GPs, and also by training subject-specific GP. While we show that these models achieve improved performance when selectively applied to the forecasting task (one performs better than the other on different subjects/visits), the average performance per model is suboptimal. To this end, we used the notion of meta learning in the proposed pGPE to design a regression-based weighting of these expert models, where the expert weights are optimized for each subject and his/her future visit. The results on a cohort of subjects from the ADNI dataset show that this newly introduced personalized weighting of the expert models leads to large improvements in accurately forecasting future ADAS-Cog13 scores and their fine-grained changes associated with the AD progression. This approach has potential to help identify at-risk patients early and improve the construction of clinical trials for AD.},

Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome.

Are these sources biased against female providers? To address this question we analyze a new dataset of online patient reviews of male and female healthcare providers with respect to numerical ratings and language use. We perform both regression and (data-driven) qualitative analyses of language via neural embedding models induced over review texts. In both cases we account for provider specialty. To do so while learning embeddings, we explicitly induce specialty, sex, and rating embeddings from review meta-data via a âmatched-samplingâ training regime. We find that females consistently receive less favorable numerical ratings overall, even after adjusting for specialty. To analyze language use in reviews of male versus female providers, we induce neural embeddings (distributed representations) of gender and qualitatively characterize the âdistributional semanticsâ that this induces. We observe differences in language use, e.g., analysis of average vector similarities over repeated runs reveal that many of the words closest to the coordinates in embedding space associated with positive sentiment and female providers describe interpersonal characteristics (sweet , considerate , caring , personable , compassionate ): such descriptors do not seem as similar to the point corresponding to positive sentiment regarding male providers. To facilitate research in this direction we publicly release data, embeddings, and all code (including Jupyter notebooks) to reproduce our analyses and further explore the data: https://github.com/avi-jit/RateMDs.},

Explainability, or the ability of an ML model to justify its outcomes and assist clinicians in rationalizing the model prediction, has been generally understood to be critical to establishing trust. However, the field suffers from the lack of concrete definitions for usable explanations in different settings. To identify specific aspects of explainability that may catalyze building trust in ML models, we surveyed clinicians from two distinct acute care specialties (Intenstive Care Unit and Emergency Department). We use their feedback to characterize when explainability helps to improve clinicians' trust in ML models. We further identify the classes of explanations that clinicians identified as most relevant and crucial for effective translation to clinical practice. Finally, we discern concrete metrics for rigorous evaluation of clinical explainability methods. By integrating perceptions of explainability between clinicians and ML researchers we hope to facilitate the endorsement and broader adoption and sustained use of ML systems in healthcare.},

 abstract = {We present an end-to-end statistical framework for personalized, accurate, and minimally invasive modeling of female reproductive hormonal patterns. Reconstructing and forecasting the evolution of hormonal dynamics is a challenging task, but a critical one to improve general understanding of the menstrual cycle and personalized detection of potential health issues. Our goal is to infer and forecast individual hormone daily levels over time, while accommodating pragmatic and minimally invasive measurement settings. To that end, our approach combines the power of probabilistic generative models (i.e., multi-task Gaussian processes) with the flexibility of neural networks (i.e., a dilated convolutional architecture) to learn complex temporal mappings. To attain accurate hormone level reconstruction with as little data as possible, we propose a sampling mechanism for optimal reconstruction accuracy with limited sampling budget. Our results show the validity of our proposed hormonal dynamic modeling framework, as it provides accurate predictive performance across different realistic sampling budgets and outperforms baselines methods.},

 abstract = {This study presents a multimodal machine learning model to predict ICD-10 diagnostic codes. We developed separate machine learning models that can handle data from different modalities, including unstructured text, semi-structured text and structured tabular data. We further employed an ensemble method to integrate all modality-specific models to generate ICD-10 codes. Key evidence was also extracted to make our prediction more convincing and explainable. We used the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC -III) dataset to validate our approach. For ICD code prediction, our best-performing model (micro-F1 = 0.7633, micro-AUC = 0.9541) significantly outperforms other baseline models including TF-IDF (micro-F1 = 0.6721, micro-AUC = 0.7879) and Text-CNN model (micro-F1 = 0.6569, micro-AUC = 0.9235). For interpretability, our approach achieves a Jaccard Similarity Coefficient (JSC) of 0.1806 on text data and 0.3105 on tabular data, where well-trained physicians achieve 0.2780 and 0.5002 respectively.},

 abstract = {We study methods for assessing the degree of systematic over- or under- estimation, known as calibration, of a learned risk model in an independent validation cohort. Here, we advance methods for evaluating clinical risk prediction models by deriving a population parameter measuring the average calibration error of the predicted risk from the true risk, and providing a method for estimation and inference. Our approach improves upon commonly-used goodness of fit tests that depends on subjective bin thresholding and may yield misleading results by reporting confidence intervals for the calibration error instead of a simple P-value that conflate calibration error and sample size. This approach enables comparison among multiple risk prediction models, and can guide model revision. We illustrate how our new method helps to understand the calibration of risk models that have been profoundly influential in clinical practice, but controversial due to their potential miscalibration.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v106-yoon19a,
 abstract = {Deciding what and when to observe is critical when making observations is costly. In a medical setting where observations can be made sequentially, making these observations (or not) should be an active choice. We refer to this as the active sensing problem. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, which we call ASAC (Active Sensing using Actor-Critic models) to address this problem. ASAC consists of two networks: a selector network and a predictor network. The selector network uses previously selected observations to determine what should be observed in the future. The predictor network uses the observations selected by the selector network to predict a label, providing feedback to the selector network (well-selected variables should be predictive of the label). The goal of the selector network is then to select variables that balance the cost of observing the selected variables with their predictive power; we wish to preserve the conditional label distribution. During training, we use the actor-critic models to allow the loss of the selector to be "back-propagated" through the sampling process. The selector network "acts" by selecting future observations to make. The predictor network acts as a "critic" by feeding predictive errors for the selected variables back to the selector network. In our experiments, we show that ASAC significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts in two real-world medical datasets.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v106-zhang19a,
 abstract = {The treatment effects of medications play a key role in guiding medical prescriptions. They are usually assessed with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which are expensive. Recently, large-scale electronic health records (EHRs) have become available, opening up new opportunities for more cost-effective assessments. However, assessing a treatment effect from EHRs is challenging: it is biased by unobserved confounders, unmeasured variables that affect both patients' medical prescription and their outcome, e.g. the patients' social economic status. To adjust for unobserved confounders, we develop the medical deconfounder, a machine learning algorithm that unbiasedly estimates treatment effects from EHRs. The medical deconfounder first constructs a substitute confounder by modeling which medications were prescribed to each patient; this substitute confounder is guaranteed to capture all multi-medication confounders, observed or unobserved (arXiv:1805.06826). It then uses this substitute confounder to adjust for the confounding bias in the analysis. We validate the medical deconfounder on two simulated and two real medical data sets. Compared to classical approaches, the medical deconfounder produces closer-to-truth treatment effect estimates; it also identifies effective medications that are more consistent with the findings in the medical literature.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v106-zheng19a,
 abstract = {Increasingly large observational datasets from healthcare and social media may allow new types of causal inference. However, these data are often missing key variables, increasing the chance of finding spurious causal relationships due to confounding. While methods exist for causal inference with latent variables in static cases, temporal relationships are more challenging, as varying time lags make latent causes more difficult to uncover and approaches often have significantly higher computational complexity. To address this, we make the key observation that while a variable may be latent in one dataset, it may be observed in another, or we may have domain knowledge about its effects. We propose a computationally efficient method that overcomes latent variables by using prior knowledge to reconstruct data for unobserved variables, while remaining robust to cases when the knowledge is wrong or does not apply. On simulated data, our approach outperforms the state of the art with a lower false discovery rate for causal inference. On real-world data from individuals with Type 1 diabetes, we show that our approach can discover causal relationships involving unmeasured meals and exercise.},
