In particular, the illness-death model is used to follow disease progression from a healthy state to an intermediate state and to a death-related final state. We aim to use those models in order to adapt treatment decisions according to the evolution of the disease. In state-of-the-art methods, the risks of transition are modeled via (semi-) Markov processes and transition-specific Cox proportional hazard (P.H.) models. We propose a neural network architecture called IDNetwork (Illness-Death Network) that relaxes the linear Cox P.H. assumption and integrates a large number of patientsâ characteristics. Our method significantly improves the predictive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on a simulated data set, on two clinical trials for patients with colon cancer and on a real-world data set in breast cancer.}

  abstract = 	 {Survival modeling is an important area of study, and has been used widely in many applications including clinical research, online advertising, manufacturing, etc. There are many methods to consider when analyzing survival problems, however these techniques generally focus on either estimating the uncertainty of different risk factors (cox-proportional hazards, etc), or predicting the time to event in a non-parametric way (e.g. tree based methods), or forecasting the survival beyond an observed horizon (parametric techniques such as exponential). In this work, we introduce efficient estimation methods for linear, tree, and neural network versions of the Beta-Logistic model - a classical extension of the logistic function into the discrete survival setting. The Beta-Logistic allows for recovery of the underlying beta distribution as well as having the advantages of non-linear or tree based techniques while still allowing for projecting beyond an observed horizon. Empirical results using simulated data as well as large-scale data-sets across three use-cases (online conversions, retention modeling in a subscription service, and survival of democracies and dictatorships), demonstrate the competitiveness of the method at these tasks. The simplicity of the method and its ability to capture skew in the data makes it a viable alternative to standard techniques particularly when we are interested in forecasting time to event beyond our observed horizon and when the underlying probabilities are heterogeneous.}

Static risk scores, such as APACHE or SAPS, have been supplemented with data-driven approaches that track dynamic mortality risk over time. Recent works have focused on enhancing the information delivered to clinicians even further by producing full survival distributions instead of point predictions or fixed horizon risks. In this work, we propose a non-parametric ensemble model, Weighted Resolution Survival Ensemble (WRSE), tailored to estimate such dynamic individual survival distributions. Inspired by the simplicity and robustness of ensemble methods, the proposed approach combines a set of binary classifiers spaced according to a decay function reflecting the relevance of short-term predictions. Models and baselines are evaluated under weighted calibration and discrimination metrics for individual survival distributions, which closely reflect the utility of a model in ICU practice. We show competitive results with state-of-the-art probabilistic models, while greatly reducing training time by factors of 2-9x.}

In this study, we apply ISD methods, specifically Cox-Proportional Hazards with Kalbfleisch-Prentice extension (CoxPH-KP) and Multi-task Logistic Regression (MTLR), to the task of predicting probability of Heart Failure (HF) rehospitalization or mortality, in a population-level database of 40,568 HF hospitalizations over the span of 8 years. Further, we compare performance of these ISD models with versus without code embeddings, that were learned in a temporally disjoint dataset of 229,359 all-cause hospitalizations. All our models show good discrimination in the validation dataset of 8,114 HF hospitalizations, with time-based concordance greater than 70% for every monthly intervals upto 8 years. Finally, we demonstrate that medical concept embedding does not always lead to improved model discrimination, but does improve model calibration, particularly over the longer time scales.}

Methods in point processes and recurrent neural networks capably model rate functions but their complexity may make interpretation, use and reuse challenging. Our work develops a high-performing and interrogable yet simple model. We introduce wavelet reconstruction networks, a multivariate point process with a sparse wavelet reconstruction kernel to model rate functions from marked, timestamped data. We show these simple models achieve improved performance when applied to forecasting complications and care visits in patients with diabetes.}

  abstract = 	 {Survival prediction aims to predict the time of occurrence of a particular event of interest, such as the time until a patient dies. The main challenge in survival prediction is the presence of incomplete observations due to censoring. The classical formulation for survival prediction treats the survival time as a continuous outcome, which leads to a censored regression problem. Recent work has reformulated the survival prediction problem by discretizing time into a finite number of bins and then applying multi-task binary classification. While the discrete-time formulation is convenient and potentially requires less assumptions than the continuous-time approach, it also loses information by discretizing time. In this paper, we empirically investigate continuous and discrete-time representations for survival prediction to try to quantify the trade-offs between the two formulations. We find that discretizing time does not necessarily decrease prediction accuracy. Furthermore, discrete-time models can result in even more accurate predictors than continuous-time models, but the number of time bins used for discretization has a significant effect on accuracy and should thus be tuned as a hyperparameter rather than specified for convenience.}

In addition, we use ordinal regression to optimize the survival probabilities over time, and penalize randomized discordant pairs. Second, many survival models are evaluated using only the ranking metrics such as the concordance index. We propose to also use the absolute error metric that evaluates the precise duration predictions on observed subjects. We demonstrate our model on two publicly available real-world datasets, and show that our mean absolute error results are significantly better than the current models, meanwhile, it is challenging to determine the best model under the concordance index.}

We combine this approach with a likelihood-based loss that includes predictions at every time step within an individualâs history, rather than just including one term per individual. The combination of this loss and model results in an interpretable approach to dynamic survival, requiring less fine tuning than existing methods, while still achieving good predictive performance.

Here, we characterize this problem and propose an adjusted log-likelihood formulation as the new objective for survival prognostication. Several models are then proposed based on the newly designed optimization objective function which produce risks that count individuals âequallyâ on risk ratios thus providing representative attention to individuals of varying risk. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach.}

In such scenarios, the event-time distribution may have temporal dependencies at different time scales that are not easily captured by classical survival models that assume training data points to be independent. In this paper, we describe a fully parametric approach to model censored time-to-event outcomes with time varying covariates. It involves learning representations of the input temporal data using Recurrent Neural Networks such as LSTMs and GRUs, followed by describing the conditional event distribution as a fixed mixture of parametric distributions. The use of the recurrent neural networks allows the learned representations to model long-term dependencies in the input data while jointly estimating the Time-to-Event. We benchmark our approach on MIMIC III: a large, publicly available dataset collected from Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, focusing on predicting duration of their ICU stays and their short term life expectancy, and we demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed approach compared to established time-to-event regression models.}

  abstract = 	 {In many biomedical applications, outcome is measured as a âtime-to-eventâ (e.g., time-to-disease progression or death). Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH) model has been widely used to assess the association between baseline characteristics of a patient and this outcome. Meanwhile, in therapeutic areas such as Oncology, clinical imaging (e.g. computerized tomography (CT) scan) is widely used for detection, diagnosis of disease, monitoring of progression and treatment effect. We are interested in using such images with neural network to build predictive models with survival data. However, the standard methodologies cannot be applied to imaging data with time-to-event outcome due to challenges such as memory constraint. In this work, we develop a simple methodology to engage images with survival data. Our proposed methodology is a modified version of CoxPH model that is amenable to SGD and allows us to overcome the existing challenges. We present the neural network architecture for the survival prediction using images. Our architecture can leverage new advances in network topology.}

We provide a description of the prevailing COVID-19 conditions in India by means of succinct visualisation via a dynamic dashboard and cluster analysis. Building upon this, we performed survival analysis on COVID-19 patients from the state of Karnataka, stratifying the data on the basis of age and gender. The findings of the same have been reported in this paper. To our knowledge, this is the largest retrospective cohort-based survival analysis in Indian context.}

  abstract = 	 {Accurate survival prediction is crucial for development of precision cancer medicine, creating the need for new sources of prognostic information. Recently, there has been significant interest in exploiting routinely collected clinical and medical imaging data to discover new prognostic markers in multiple cancer types. However, most of the previous studies focus on individual data modalities alone and do not make use of recent advances in machine learning for survival prediction. We present Deep-CR MTLR â a novel machine learning approach for accurate cancer survival prediction from multi-modal clinical and imaging data in the presence of competing risks based on neural networks and an extension of the multi-task logistic regression framework. We demonstrate improved prognostic performance of the multi-modal approach over single modality predictors in a cohort of 2552 head and neck cancer patients, particularly for cancer specific survival, where our approach achieves 2-year AUROC of 0.774 and C-index of 0.788.}

However, these analyses may suffer from small sample sizes, high dimensionality and low signal-to-noise ratios. To improve prediction stability and better understand risk factors associated with outcomes of interest, we propose a Kullback-Leibler-based discrete relative risk modeling procedure to borrow information from existing models. Simulations and real data analysis were conducted to show the advantage of the proposed method compared with those solely based on data from current study or prior information.}

  abstract = 	 {When predicting the survival time of a patient, different covariates may be important at different times. We introduce a survival prediction model, âdiscrete hazard Bayesian network", that can provide individual survival curves and also identify which features are relevant for each time interval. This model encodes the discrete hazard function as a sequence of (possibly different) Bayesian networks, one for each time interval. Note each such network includes a âDeathâ node, which is True iff the person dies in that interval. A set of features relevant for each time interval are the nodes in the Markov blanket around that âDeath" node for that interval. We also apply a âdiscrete hazard computation correction" based on the effective sample size â a correction that avoids biased survival curves. We first show that our model is effective by demonstrating that it can identify the time-varying relevance of the features, using the synthetic dataset. We then provide two real-world examples by analyzing the relevant features for different times on the North Alberta cancer dataset and the Norway/Stanford breast cancer dataset.}

However, most clinical omics data were collected from individuals of European ancestry. Such ancestrally imbalanced data may lead to inaccurate machine learning models for the data-disadvantaged ethnic groups and thus generate new health care disparities. In this work, we develop a transfer learning scheme for survival analysis with multi-ethnic data. We perform machine learning experiments on real and synthetic clinical omics datasets to show that transfer learning can improve the prognostic accuracy of Cox neural network models for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups.}
