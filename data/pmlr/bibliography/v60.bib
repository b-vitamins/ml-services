We used a dataset of 73599 biotransformations, applied SMIRKS to define biotransformations of interest and constructed five datasets

The results show that CVAP produces well-calibrated predictions for all datasets with good predictive capability,

The aim of the study is to give guidance to which methods perform best where there is limited data.
The evaluation has been made on a large public dataset of Ames mutagenicity data, relevant for drug discovery,
a spam dataset and a diverse set of drug discovery datasets.
When considering predictions only, the transductive conformal predictor performs the best in terms of validity.

The provision of some kind of indication of the likelihood of a recognition being correct is a desirable property of AFR techniques in many applications,

This paper investigates the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework for providing reliable confidence information for AFR.

Although widely applied, this approach is resource and potentially labour intensive.
Therefore, improved computational approaches to streamline screening is in high demand.
In this study we introduce conformal prediction paired with a gain-cost function to make predictions
in order to maximise the gain of screening campaigns on new screening sets.
Our results indicate that using 20\% of the screening library as an initial screening set
and using the data obtained together with a gain-cost function,
the significance level of the predictor that maximise the gain can be identified.
Importantly, the parameters for the predictor derived from the initial screening set was highly predictive of the maximal gain also on the remaining data.
Using this approach, the gain of a screening campaign can be improved considerably.},

Classical change-point detection procedures, such as CUSUM, Shiryaev-Roberts and Posterior Probability statistics, are optimal only if the change-point model is known, which is an unrealistic assumption in typical applied problems. Instead we propose a new method for change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal Martingales, which requires only the independence and identical distribution of observations. We compare the proposed approach to standard methods, as well as to change-point detection oracles, which model a typical practical situation when we have only imprecise (albeit parametric) information about pre- and post-change data distributions. Results of comparison provide evidence that change-point detection based on Inductive Conformal Martingales is an efficient tool, capable to work under quite general conditions unlike traditional approaches.},

Namely, we introduce and explore predictive distribution functions that always satisfy a natural property of validity in terms of guaranteed coverage for IID observations. The focus is on a prediction algorithm that we call the Least Squares Prediction Machine (LSPM). The LSPM generalizes the classical Dempster–Hill predictive distributions to nonparametric regression problems.

 abstract = {Multi-label conformal prediction has attracted much attention in the conformal predictor (CP) community.
In this article, we propose to combine CP with random $k$-labelsets (RA$k$EL) method,
which is state-of-the-art multi-label classification method for large number of labels.
In the framework of RA$k$EL, the original problem is reduced to a number of small-sized multi-label classification tasks
by randomly breaking the initial set of labels into a number of small-sized labelsets,
and then label powerset (LP) method is employed on these tasks respectively.
In this work, ICP-RF, an inductive conformal predictor based on random forest,
is used in each multi-label task in order to get p-values for predictions of the LP model,
and then the predictions are aggregated to get a final result.
Experimental results on six benchmark datasets empirically demonstrate the calibration property of ICP-RF as LP models,
and show that conformal prediction can significantly improve the performances of the proposed approach, which is called RA$k$EL.
However, the validity property of CP does not hold in CP-RA$k$EL.
In the future work we will study how to use some new CP techniques to calibrate the new method.},

 abstract = {In many applications, the real high-dimensional data occupy only a very small part in the high dimensional âobservation spaceâ
whose intrinsic dimension is small.
The most popular model of such data is Manifold model which assumes that the data lie on or near an unknown manifold (Data Manifold, DM) of lower dimensionality
embedded in an ambient high-dimensional input space (Manifold Assumption about high-dimensional data).
Manifold Learning is a Dimensionality Reduction problem under the Manifold assumption about the processed data,
and its goal is to construct a low-dimensional parameterization of the DM (global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM)
from a finite dataset sampled from the DM.
Manifold Assumption means that local neighborhood of each manifold point is equivalent to an area of low-dimensional Euclidean space.
Because of this, most of Manifold Learning algorithms include two parts:
âlocal partâ in which certain characteristics reflecting low-dimensional local structure of neighborhoods of all sample points
are constructed via nonparametric estimation,
and âglobal partâ in which global low-dimensional coordinates on the DM are constructed
by solving the certain convex optimization problem for specific cost function depending on the local characteristics.
Both statistical properties of âlocal partâ and its average over manifold are considered in the paper.
The article is an extension of the paper (Yanovich, 2016) for the case of nonparametric estimation.},
