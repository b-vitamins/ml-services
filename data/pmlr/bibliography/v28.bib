We provide such results in both the standard parametric MAB setting, as well as for a new model in which the action space is finite but growing with time.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v28-afkanpour13,
 abstract = {We consider the problem of simultaneously learning to linearly combine a very large number of kernels and learn a good predictor based on the learnt kernel. When the number of kernels $d$ to be combined is very large, multiple kernel learning methods whose computational cost scales linearly in $d$ are intractable. We propose a randomized version of the mirror descent algorithm to overcome this issue, under the objective of minimizing the group $p$-norm penalized empirical risk. The key to achieve the required exponential speed-up is the computationally efficient construction of low-variance estimates of the gradient. We propose importance sampling based estimates, and find that the ideal distribution samples a coordinate with a probability proportional to the magnitude of the corresponding gradient. We show the surprising result that in the case of learning the coefficients of a polynomial kernel, the combinatorial structure of the base kernels to be combined allows the implementation of sampling from this distribution to run in $O(\log(d))$ time, making the total computational cost of the method to achieve an $ε$-optimal solution to be $O(\log(d)/ε^2)$, thereby allowing our method to operate for very large values of $d$. Experiments with simulated and real data confirm that the new algorithm is computationally more efficient than its state-of-the-art alternatives.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of active learning for cost-sensitive multiclass classification. We propose selective sampling algorithms, which process the data in a streaming fashion, querying only a subset of the labels. For these algorithms, we analyze the regret and label complexity when the labels are generated according to a generalized linear model. We establish that the gains of active learning over passive learning can range from none to exponentially large, based on a natural notion of margin. We also present a safety guarantee to guard against model mismatch. Numerical simulations show that our algorithms indeed obtain a low regret with a small number of queries.},

 abstract = {Thompson Sampling is one of the oldest heuristics for multi-armed bandit problems. It is a randomized algorithm based on Bayesian ideas, and has recently generated significant interest after several studies demonstrated it to have better empirical performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods. However, many questions regarding its theoretical performance remained open. In this paper, we design and analyze a generalization of Thompson Sampling algorithm for the stochastic contextual multi-armed bandit problem with linear payoff functions, when the contexts are provided by an adaptive adversary. This is among the most important and widely studied version of the contextual bandits problem. We prove a high probability regret bound of O(d2/e√T1+e) in time T for any 0 < e < 1, where d is the dimension of each context vector and e is a parameter used by the algorithm. Our results provide the first theoretical guarantees for the contextual version of Thompson Sampling, and are close to the lower bound of Ω(d√T) for this problem. This essentially solves a COLT open problem of Chapelle and Li [COLT 2012].},

We introduce the nested Chinese Restaurant Franchise Process to obtain both hierarchical tree-structured representations for objects, akin to (but more general than) the nested Chinese Restaurant Process while sharing their structure akin to the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process.

Moreover, by decoupling the structure generating part of the process from the components responsible for the observations, we are able to apply the same statistical approach to a variety of user generated data. In particular, we model the joint distribution of microblogs and locations for Twitter for users. This leads to a 40% reduction in location uncertainty relative to the best previously published results. Moreover, we model documents from the NIPS papers dataset, obtaining excellent perplexity relative to (hierarchical) Pachinko allocation and LDA.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v28-ailon13,
 abstract = {This paper investigates graph clustering in the planted cluster model in the presence of {\em small clusters}. Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\em all} clusters must be sufficiently large (in particular, $\tildeΩ(\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based recovery approach proposed in Jalali et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones. Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover {\em almost all clusters} via a "peeling strategy", i.e., recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the {\em partial observation} setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed.The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed). From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimensional statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxationsdoes the job.},

 abstract = {The semantic interpretation of images is one of the core applications of deep learning. Several techniques have been recently proposed to model the relation between two images, with application to pose estimation, action recognition or invariant object recognition. Among these techniques, higher-order Boltzmann machines or relational autoencoders consider projections of the images on different subspaces and intermediate layers act as transformation specific detectors. In this work, we extend the mathematical study of (Memisevic, 2012b) to show that it is possible to use a unique projection for both images in a way that turns intermediate layers as spectrum encoders of transformations. We show that this results in networks that are easier to tune and have greater generalization capabilities.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v28-allenzhu13,
 abstract = {Motivated by applications of large-scale graph clustering, we study random-walk-based LOCAL algorithms whose running times depend only on the size of the output cluster, rather than the entire graph. All previously known such algorithms guarantee an output conductance of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\phi(A)})$ when the target set $A$ has conductance $\phi(A)\in[0,1]$. In this paper, we improve it to $$\tilde{O}\bigg( \min\Big\{\sqrt{\phi(A)}, \frac{\phi(A)}{\sqrt{\mathsf{Conn}(A)}} \Big\} \bigg)\enspace, $$ where the internal connectivity parameter $\mathsf{Conn}(A) \in [0,1]$ is defined as the reciprocal of the mixing time of the random walk over the induced subgraph on $A$. For instance, using $\mathsf{Conn}(A) = \Omega(\lambda(A) / \log n)$ where $\lambda$ is the second eigenvalue of the Laplacian of the induced subgraph on $A$, our conductance guarantee can be as good as $\tilde{O}(\phi(A)/\sqrt{\lambda(A)})$. This builds an interesting connection to the recent advance of the so-called improved Cheeger's Inequality [KKL+13], which says that global spectral algorithms can provide a conductance guarantee of $O(\phi_{\mathsf{opt}}/\sqrt{\lambda_3})$ instead of $O(\sqrt{\phi_{\mathsf{opt}}})$. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantee on the clustering accuracy (in terms of precision and recall) of the output set. We also prove that our analysis is tight, and perform empirical evaluation to support our theory on both synthetic and real data. It is worth noting that, our analysis outperforms prior work when the cluster is well-connected. In fact, the better it is well-connected inside, the more significant improvement (both in terms of conductance and accuracy) we can obtain. Our results shed light on why in practice some random-walk-based algorithms perform better than its previous theory, and help guide future research about local clustering.},

One of the difficulties of this problem is that in the measurement space, behaviors can be very mixed, despite existing a latent representation where they can be easily separated. We propose a mixture model based on a Dirichlet Process (DP) to simultaneously cluster the observed time-series and recover a sparse representation of the behaviors using a Laplacian prior as the base measure of the DP. We show that for linear models, e.g potential functions generated by linear combinations of a large number of features, it is possible to compute analytically the marginal of the observations and derive an efficient sampler. The method is evaluated using robot behaviors and real data from human motion and compared to other techniques.},

 abstract = {We introduce Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis (DCCA), a method to learn complex nonlinear transformations of two views of data such that the resulting representations are highly linearly correlated. Parameters of both transformations are jointly learned to maximize the (regularized) total correlation. It can be viewed as a nonlinear extension of the linear method canonical correlation analysis (CCA). It is an alternative to the nonparametric method kernel canonical correlation analysis (KCCA) for learning correlated nonlinear transformations. Unlike KCCA, DCCA does not require an inner product, and has the advantages of a parametric method: training time scales well with data size and the training data need not be referenced when computing the representations of unseen instances. In experiments on two real-world datasets, we find that DCCA learns representations with significantly higher correlation than those learned by CCA and KCCA. We also introduce a novel non-saturating sigmoid function based on the cube root that may be useful more generally in feedforward neural networks.},

We propose a fast training algorithm that exploits this bound, yielding speedups of an order of magnitude at no cost in the final performance of the classifier.

 abstract = {Hyperparameter learning has traditionally been a manual task because of the limited number of trials. Today's computing infrastructures allow bigger evaluation budgets, thus opening the way for algorithmic approaches. Recently, surrogate-based optimization was successfully applied to hyperparameter learning for deep belief networks and to WEKA classifiers. The methods combined brute force computational power with model building about the behavior of the error function in the hyperparameter space, and they could significantly improve on manual hyperparameter tuning. What may make experienced practitioners even better at hyperparameter optimization is their ability to generalize across similar learning problems. In this paper, we propose a generic method to incorporate knowledge from previous experiments when simultaneously tuning a learning algorithm on new problems at hand. To this end, we combine surrogate-based ranking and optimization techniques for surrogate-based collaborative tuning (SCoT). We demonstrate SCoT in two experiments where it outperforms standard tuning techniques and single-problem surrogate-based optimization.},

 abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning techniques have historically encountered a number of difficulties scaling up to large observation spaces. One promising approach has been to decompose the model learning task into a number of smaller, more manageable sub-problems by factoring the observation space. Typically, many different factorizations are possible, which can make it difficult to select an appropriate factorization without extensive testing. In this paper we introduce the class of recursively decomposable factorizations, and show how exact Bayesian inference can be used to efficiently guarantee predictive performance close to the best factorization in this class. We demonstrate the strength of this approach by presenting a collection of empirical results for 20 different Atari 2600 games.},

 abstract = {It has previously been hypothesized, and supported with some experimental evidence, that deeper representations, when well trained, tend to do a better job at disentangling the underlying factors of variation. We study the following related conjecture: better representations, in the sense of better disentangling, can be exploited to produce faster-mixing Markov chains. Consequently, mixing would be more efficient at higher levels of representation. To better understand why and how this is happening, we propose a secondary conjecture: the higher-level samples fill more uniformly the space they occupy and the high-density manifolds tend to unfold when represented at higher levels. The paper discusses these hypotheses and tests them experimentally through visualization and measurements of mixing and interpolating between samples.},

 abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.

In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

When the number of labels grows to the hundreds or even thousands, existing multi-label classification methods often become computationally inefficient. In recent years, a number of remedies have been proposed. However, they are based either on simple dimension reduction techniques or involve expensive optimization problems. In this paper, we address this problem by selecting a small subset of class labels that can approximately span the original label space. This is performed by an efficient randomized sampling procedure where the sampling probability of each class label re flects its importance among all the labels. Experiments on a number of real-world multi-label data sets with many labels demonstrate the appealing performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm.},

This algorithm is an instance of a general spectral system identification framework, from which it inherits several desirable properties, including statistical consistency and no local optima. Compared with popular batch optimization or multiple-hypothesis tracking (MHT) methods for range-only SLAM, our spectral approach offers guaranteed low computational requirements and good tracking performance. Compared with popular extended Kalman filter (EKF) or extended information filter (EIF) approaches, and many MHT ones, our approach does not need to linearize a transition or measurement model; such linearizations can cause severe errors in EKFs and EIFs, and to a lesser extent MHT, particularly for the highly non-Gaussian posteriors encountered in range-only SLAM. We provide a theoretical analysis of our method, including finite-sample error bounds. Finally, we demonstrate on a real-world robotic SLAM problem that our algorithm is not only theoretically justified, but works well in practice: in a comparison of multiple methods, the lowest errors come from a combination of our algorithm with batch optimization, but our method alone produces nearly as good a result at far lower computational cost.},

We propose the novel concept of learning a discrete representation of the continuous state space to solve the integrals in continuous POMDPs efficiently and generalize sparse calculations over the continuous space. The representation is iteratively refined as part of a novel Value Iteration step and does not depend on prior knowledge. Consistency for the learned generalization is asserted by a self-correction algorithm. The presented concept is implemented for continuous state and observation spaces based on Monte Carlo approximation to allow for arbitrary POMDP models. In an experimental comparison it yields higher values in significantly shorter time than state of the art algorithms and solves higher-dimensional problems.},

 abstract = {The classical mixture of Gaussians model is related to K-means via small-variance asymptotics: as the covariances of the Gaussians tend to zero, the negative log-likelihood of the mixture of Gaussians model approaches the K-means objective, and the EM algorithm approaches the K-means algorithm. Kulis & Jordan (2012) used this observation to obtain a novel K-means-like algorithm from a Gibbs sampler for the Dirichlet process (DP) mixture. We instead consider applying small-variance asymptotics directly to the posterior in Bayesian nonparametric models. This framework is independent of any specific Bayesian inference algorithm, and it has the major advantage that it generalizes immediately to a range of models beyond the DP mixture. To illustrate, we apply our framework to the feature learning setting, where the beta process and Indian buffet process provide an appropriate Bayesian nonparametric prior. We obtain a novel objective function that goes beyond clustering to learn (and penalize new) groupings for which we relax the mutual exclusivity and exhaustivity assumptions of clustering. We demonstrate several other algorithms, all of which are scalable and simple to implement. Empirical results demonstrate the benefits of the new framework.},

 abstract = {In applications such as audio denoising, music transcription, music remixing, and audio-based forensics, it is desirable to decompose a single-channel recording into its respective sources. One of the current most effective class of methods to do so is based on nonnegative matrix factorization and related latent variable models. Such techniques, however, typically perform poorly when no isolated training data is given and do not allow user feedback to correct for poor results. To overcome these issues, we allow a user to interactively constrain a latent variable model by painting on a time-frequency display of sound to guide the learning process. The annotations are used within the framework of posterior regularization to impose linear grouping constraints that would otherwise be difficult to achieve via standard priors. For the constraints considered, an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm is derived with closed-form multiplicative updates, drawing connections to nonnegative matrix factorization methods, and allowing for high-quality interactive-rate separation without explicit training data.},

Particle filters fail for models that include such variables, while methods that use Gibbs sampling of parameter variables may incur a per-sample cost that grows linearly with the length of the observation sequence. Storvik devised a method for incremental computation of exact sufficient statistics that, for some cases, reduces the per-sample cost to a constant. In this paper, we demonstrate a connection between Storvik's filter and a Kalman filter in parameter space and establish more general conditions under which Storvik's filter works. Drawing on an analogy to the extended Kalman filter, we develop and analyze, both theoretically and experimentally, a Taylor approximation to the parameter posterior that allows Storvik's method to be applied to a broader class of models. Our experiments on both synthetic examples and real applications show improvement over existing methods.},

In this paper we show that every constrained minimization problem of a ratio of non-negative set functions allows a tight relaxation into an unconstrained continuous optimization problem. This result leads to a flexible framework for solving constrained problems in network analysis.

 abstract = {Causality discovery without manipulation is considered a crucial problem to a variety of applications, such as genetic therapy. The state-of-the-art solutions, e.g. LiNGAM, return accurate results when the number of labeled samples is larger than the number of variables. These approaches are thus applicable only when large numbers of samples are available or the problem domain is sufficiently small. Motivated by the observations of the local sparsity properties on causal structures, we propose a general Split-and-Merge strategy, named SADA, to enhance the scalability of a wide class of causality discovery algorithms. SADA is able to accurately identify the causal variables, even when the sample size is significantly smaller than the number of variables. In SADA, the variables are partitioned into subsets, by finding cuts on the sparse probabilistic graphical model over the variables. By running mainstream causation discovery algorithms, e.g. LiNGAM, on the subproblems, complete causality can be reconstructed by combining all the partial results. SADA benefits from the recursive division technique, since each small subproblem generates more accurate result under the same number of samples. We theoretically prove that SADA always reduces the scale of problems without significant sacrifice on result accuracy, depending only on the local sparsity condition over the variables. Experiments on real-world datasets verify the improvements on scalability and accuracy by applying SADA on top of existing causation algorithms.},

Transfer learning addresses this problem by using the knowledge gained from a related and already labeled data source, whereas active learning focuses on selecting a small set of informative samples for manual annotation. Recently, there has been much interest in developing frameworks that combine both transfer and active learning methodologies. A few such frameworks reported in literature perform transfer and active learning in two separate stages. In this work, we present an integrated framework that performs transfer and active learning simultaneously by solving a single convex optimization problem. The proposed framework computes the weights of source domain data and selects the samples from the target domain data simultaneously, by minimizing a common objective of reducing distribution difference between the data set consisting of re-weighted source and the queried target domain data and the set of unlabeled target domain data. Comprehensive experiments on real data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach.},

The employed large-margin classifiers are connected in the context of a Markov-switching construction that allows for capturing complex temporal dynamics in the modeled datasets. Appropriate stick-breaking priors are imposed over the component switching mechanism of our model to allow for data-driven determination of the optimal number of component large-margin classifiers, under a standard nonparametric Bayesian inference scheme. Efficient model training is performed under the maximum entropy discrimination (MED) framework, which integrates the large-margin principle with Bayesian posterior inference.

 abstract = {We define a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where simple arms with unknown istributions  form \em super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the outcomes of its related simple arms are observed, which helps the selection of super arms in future rounds. The reward of the super arm depends on the outcomes of played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an (Î±,Î²)-approximation oracle that takes the  means of the distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability Î²generates  an Î±fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of a CMAB algorithm is to minimize \em (Î±,Î²)-approximation regret, which is the difference in total expected reward between the Î±Î²fraction of expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected reward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(\log n) regret, where n is the number of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound for classical MAB problem up to a constant factor, and it significantly improves the regret bound in a recent paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) for online advertising and social influence maximization for viral marketing, both having nonlinear reward structures.},

 abstract = {Active learning can lead to a dramatic reduction in labeling effort. However, in many practical implementations (such as crowdsourcing, surveys, high-throughput experimental design), it is preferable to query labels for batches of examples to be labelled in parallel. While several heuristics have been proposed for batch-mode active learning, little is known about their theoretical performance. We consider batch mode active learning and more general information-parallel stochastic optimization problems that exhibit adaptive submodularity, a natural diminishing returns condition. We prove that for such problems, a simple greedy strategy is competitive with the optimal batch-mode policy. In some cases, surprisingly, the use of batches incurs competitively low cost, even when compared to a fully sequential strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on batch-mode active learning tasks, where it outperforms the state of the art, as well as the novel problem of multi-stage influence maximization in social networks.},

 abstract = {Many models for sparse regression typically assume that the covariates are known completely, and without noise. Particularly in high-dimensional applications, this is often not the case. Worse yet, even estimating statistics of the noise (the noise covariance) can be a central challenge. In this paper we develop a simple variant of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) for precisely this setting. We show that without knowledge of the noise covariance, our algorithm recovers the support, and we provide matching lower bounds that show that our algorithm performs at the minimax optimal rate. While simple, this is the first algorithm that (provably) recovers support in a noise-distribution-oblivious manner. When knowledge of the noise-covariance is available, our algorithm matches the best-known l2-recovery bounds available. We show that these too are min-max optimal. Along the way, we also obtain improved performance guarantees for OMP for the standard sparse regression problem with Gaussian noise.},

In this paper, we study the problem of utilizing auxiliary information as features of factorization and propose formalizing the problem as general functional matrix factorization, whose model includes conventional matrix factorization models as its special cases. Moreover, we propose a gradient boosting based algorithm to efficiently solve the optimization problem. Finally, we give two specific algorithms for efficient feature function construction for two specific tasks. Our method can construct more suitable feature functions by searching in an infinite functional space based on training data and thus can yield better prediction accuracy.

 abstract = {In real crowdsourcing applications, each label from a crowd usually comes with a certain cost. Given a pre-fixed amount of budget, since different tasks have different ambiguities and different workers have different expertises, we want to find an optimal way to allocate the budget among instance-worker pairs such that the overall label quality can be maximized. To address this issue, we start from the simplest setting in which all workers are assumed to be perfect. We formulate the problem as a Bayesian Markov Decision Process (MDP). Using the dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, one can obtain the optimal allocation policy for a given budget. However, DP is computationally intractable. To solve the computational challenge, we propose a novel approximate policy which is called optimistic knowledge gradient. It is practically efficient while theoretically its consistency can be guaranteed. We then extend the MDP framework to deal with inhomogeneous workers and tasks with contextual information available. The experiments on both simulated and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v28-chen13g,
 abstract = {The paper explores the problem of \emph{spectral compressed sensing}, which aims to recover a spectrally sparse signal from a small random subset of its $n$ time domain samples. The signal of interest is assumed to be a superposition of $r$ multi-dimensional complex sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any \emph{continuous} values in the normalized frequency domain. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm, called \emph{Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC)}, based on structured matrix completion that does not require prior knowledge of the model order. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form exhibiting multi-fold Hankel structure, and then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of $r\log^{4}n$, and is stable against bounded noise. Even if a constant portion of samples are corrupted with arbitrary magnitude, EMaC still allows exact recovery, provided that the sample complexity exceeds the order of $r^{2}\log^{3}n$. Along the way, our results demonstrate the power of convex relaxation in completing a low-rank multi-fold Hankel or Toeplitz matrix from minimal observed entries. The performance of our algorithm and its applicability to super resolution are further validated by numerical experiments.},

 abstract = {We consider high dimensional sparse regression with arbitrary - possibly, severe or coordinated - errors in the covariates matrix. We are interested in understanding how many corruptions we can tolerate, while identifying the correct support. To the best of our knowledge, neither standard outlier rejection techniques, nor recently developed robust regression algorithms (that focus only on corrupted response variables), nor recent algorithms for dealing with stochastic noise or erasures, can provide guarantees on support recovery. As we show, neither can the natural brute force algorithm that takes exponential time to find the subset of data and support columns, that yields the smallest regression error.

We explore the power of a simple idea: replace the essential linear algebraic calculation - the inner product - with a robust counterpart that cannot be greatly affected by a controlled number of arbitrarily corrupted points: the trimmed inner product. We consider three popular algorithms in the uncorrupted setting: Thresholding Regression, Lasso, and the Dantzig selector, and show that the counterparts obtained using the trimmed inner product are provably robust.},

They showed that a plain, deep DAE can denoise noisy images as well as the conventional methods such as BM3D and KSVD. Both of them approached image denoising by denoising small, image patches of a larger image and combining them to form a clean image. In this setting, it is usual to use the encoder of the DAE to obtain the latent representation and subsequently apply the decoder to get the clean patch. We propose that a simple sparsification of the latent representation found by the encoder improves denoising performance, both when the DAE was trained with and without sparsity regularization. The experiments confirm that the proposed sparsification indeed helps both denoising a small image patch and denoising a larger image consisting of those patches. Furthermore, it is found out that the proposed method improves even classification performance when test samples are corrupted with noise.},

The main technical contribution of the paper is a novel and efficient algorithm for deciding whether to explore nodes during backtracking, based on a variational approximation. This reduces the number of computations per node, and overcomes the limitations of Bregman Ball Trees on high dimensional data. In addition, our strategy is applicable also to probability distributions with hidden state variables, and is not limited to regular exponential family distributions.

Experiments demonstrate substantial speedups over both Bregman Ball Trees and over brute force search, on both moderate and high dimensional histogram data. In addition, experiments on linear dynamical systems demonstrate the flexibility of our approach to latent variable models.},

 abstract = {Starting from a sample path of a multivariate stochastic process, we study several techniques to isolate linear combinations of the variables with a maximal amount of mean reversion, while constraining the variance of the combination to be larger than a given threshold. We show that many of the optimization problems arising in this context can be solved exactly using semidefinite programming and a variant of the S-lemma. In finance, these methods can be used to isolate statistical arbitrage opportunities, i.e. mean reverting baskets with enough variance to overcome market friction. In a more general setting, mean reversion and its generalizations can also be used as a proxy for stationarity, while variance simply measures signal strength.},

 abstract = {Popular sparse estimation methods based on $\ell_1$-relaxation, such as the Lasso and the Dantzig selector, require the knowledge of the variance of the noise in order to properly tune the regularization parameter. This constitutes a major obstacle in applying these methods in several frameworks---such as time series, random fields, inverse problems---for which the noise is rarely homoscedastic and its level is hard to know in advance. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the joint estimation of the conditional mean and the conditional variance in a high-dimensional (auto-) regression setting. An attractive feature of the proposed estimator is that it is efficiently computable even for very large scale problems by solving a second-order cone program (SOCP). We present theoretical analysis and numerical results assessing the performance of the proposed procedure.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v28-das13,
 abstract = {In a recent pioneering approach LDA was used to discover cross cutting concerns (CCC) automatically from software codebases. LDA though successful in detecting prominent concerns, fails to detect many useful CCCs including ones that may be heavily executed but elude discovery because they do not have a strong prevalence in source-code. We pose this problem as that of discovering topics that rarely occur in individual documents, which we will refer to as subtle topics. Recently an interesting approach, namely focused topic models(FTM) was proposed in (Williamson et al., 2010) for detecting rare topics. FTM, though successful in detecting topics which occur prominently in very few documents, is unable to detect subtle topics. Discovering subtle topics thus remains an important open problem. To address this issue we propose subtle topic models (STM). STM uses a generalized stick breaking process (GSBP) as a prior for defining multiple distributions over topics. This hierarchical structure on topics allows STM to discover rare topics beyond the capabilities of FTM. The associated inference is non-standard and is solved by exploiting the relationship between GSBP and generalized Dirichlet distribution. Empirical results show that STM is able to discover subtle CCC in two benchmark code-bases, a feat which is beyond the scope of existing topic models, thus demonstrating the potential of the model in automated concern discovery, a known difficult problem in Software Engineering. Furthermore it is observed that even in general text corpora STM outperforms the state of art in discovering subtle topics.},

The main advantage is that we only require a prior distribution on a class of simulators (generative models). This is useful in domains where an analytical probabilistic model of the underlying process is too complex to formulate, but where detailed simulation models are available. ABC-RL allows the use of any Bayesian reinforcement learning technique, even in this case. In addition, it can be seen as an extension of rollout algorithms to the case where we do not know what the correct model to draw rollouts from is. We experimentally demonstrate the potential of this approach in a comparison with LSPI. Finally, we introduce a theorem showing that ABC is a sound methodology in principle, even when non-sufficient statistics are used.},

We present a suite of highly efficient algorithms based on data-dependent and random projections of word-frequency patterns to identify novel words and associated topics. We will also discuss the statistical guarantees of the data-dependent projections method based on two mild assumptions on the prior density of topic document matrix. Our key insight here is that the maximum and minimum values of cross-document frequency patterns projected along any direction are associated with novel words. While our sample complexity bounds for topic recovery are similar to the state-of-art, the computational complexity of our random projection scheme scales linearly with the number of documents and the number of words per document.

 abstract = {We consider Support Vector Machines (SVMs) learned together with linear transformations of the feature spaces on which they are applied. Under this scenario the radius of the smallest data enclosing sphere is no longer fixed. Therefore optimizing the SVM error bound by considering both the radius and the margin has the potential to deliver a tighter error bound. In this paper we present two novel algorithms: R-SVM µ+--a SVM radius-margin based feature selection algorithm, and R-SVM+-- a metric learning-based SVM. We derive our algorithms by exploiting a new tighter approximation of the radius and a metric learning interpretation of SVM. Both optimize directly the radius-margin error bound using linear transformations. Unlike almost all existing radius-margin based SVM algorithms which are either non-convex or combinatorial, our algorithms are standard quadratic convex optimization problems with linear or quadratic constraints. We perform a number of experiments on benchmark datasets. R-SVMµ+ exhibits excellent feature selection performance compared to the state-of-the-art feature selection methods, such as L1-norm and elastic-net based methods. R-SVM+ achieves a significantly better classification performance compared to SVM and its other state-of-the-art variants. From the results it is clear that the incorporation of the radius, as a means to control the data spread, in the cost function has strong beneficial effects.},

Bayesian inference in non-conjugate LGMs is difficult due to intractable integrals involving the Gaussian prior and nonconjugate likelihoods. Algorithms based on variational Gaussian (VG) approximations are widely employed since they strike a favorable balance between accuracy, generality, speed, and ease of use. However, the structure of the optimization problems associated with these approximations remains poorly understood, and standard solvers take too long to converge. We derive a novel dual variational inference approach that exploits the convexity property of the VG approximations. We obtain an algorithm that solves a convex optimization problem, reduces the number of variational parameters, and converges much faster than previous methods. Using real-world data, we demonstrate these advantages on a variety of LGMs, including Gaussian process classification, and latent Gaussian Markov random fields.},

We predict the true pairs using a likelihood ratio that trades off the entities' similarity with their rarity. This method always outperforms using only similarity; however, with certain parameter settings, similarity turns out to be surprisingly competitive.

 abstract = {Shared representations are highly appealing due to their potential for gains in computational and statistical efficiency. Compressing a shared representation leads to greater computational savings, but can also severely decrease performance on a target task. Recently, sparselets (Song et al., 2012) were introduced as a new shared intermediate representation for multiclass object detection with deformable part models (Felzenszwalb et al., 2010a), showing significant speedup factors, but with a large decrease in task performance. In this paper we describe a new training framework that learns which sparselets to activate in order to optimize a discriminative objective, leading to larger speedup factors with no decrease in task performance. We first reformulate sparselets in a general structured output prediction framework, then analyze when sparselets lead to computational efficiency gains, and lastly show experimental results on object detection and image classification tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that discriminative activation substantially outperforms the previous reconstructive approach which, together with our structured output prediction formulation, make sparselets broadly applicable and significantly more effective.},

Our main results consist of an empirical evaluation of the performance quality and running time of sampling and projection methods on a diverse suite of SPSD matrices. Our results highlight complementary aspects of sampling versus projection methods; they characterize the effects of common data preprocessing steps on the performance of these algorithms; and they point to important differences between uniform sampling and nonuniform sampling methods based on leverage scores. In addition, our empirical results illustrate that existing theory is so weak that it does not provide even a qualitative guide to practice. Thus, we complement our empirical results with a suite of worst-case theoretical bounds for both random sampling and random projection methods. These bounds are qualitatively superior to existing bounds---e.g. improved additive-error bounds for spectral and Frobenius norm error and relative-error bounds for trace norm error---and they point to future directions to make these algorithms useful in even larger-scale machine learning applications.},

However, if the controller is a human or animal subject, the subject's internal dynamics model may differ from the true plant dynamics. Here, we consider the problem of learning the subject's internal model from demonstrations of control and knowledge of task goals. Due to sensory feedback delay, the subject uses an internal model to generate an internal prediction of the current plant state, which may differ from the actual plant state. We develop a probabilistic framework and exact EM algorithm to jointly estimate the internal model, internal state trajectories, and feedback delay. We applied this framework to demonstrations by a nonhuman primate of brain-machine interface (BMI) control. We discovered that the subject's internal model deviated from the true BMI plant dynamics and provided significantly better explanation of the recorded neural control signals than did the true plant dynamics.},

Here we apply survival theory to develop general additive and multiplicative risk models under which the network inference problems can be solved efficiently by exploiting their convexity. Our additive risk model generalizes several existing network inference models. We show all these models are particular cases of our more general model. Our multiplicative model allows for modeling scenarios in which a node can either increase or decrease the risk of activation of another node, in contrast with previous approaches, which consider only positive risk increments.

Our efficient aggressive active learner of half-spaces has formal approximation guarantees that hold when the pool is separable with a margin. While our analysis is focused on the realizable setting, we show that a simple heuristic allows using the same algorithm successfully for pools with low error as well. We further compare the aggressive approach to the mellow approach, and prove that there are cases in which the aggressive approach results in significantly better label complexity compared to the mellow approach.

 abstract = {We extend kernelized matrix factorization with a full-Bayesian treatment and with an ability to work with multiple side information sources expressed as different kernels. Kernels have been introduced to integrate side information about the rows and columns, which is necessary for making out-of-matrix predictions. We discuss specifically binary output matrices but extensions to realvalued matrices are straightforward. We extend the state of the art in two key aspects: (i) A full-conjugate probabilistic formulation of the kernelized matrix factorization enables an efficient variational approximation, whereas full-Bayesian treatments are not computationally feasible in the earlier approaches. (ii) Multiple side information sources are included, treated as different kernels in multiple kernel learning which additionally reveals which side sources are informative. We then show that the framework can also be used for supervised and semi-supervised multilabel classification and multi-output regression, by considering samples and outputs as the domains where matrix factorization operates. Our method outperforms alternatives in predicting drug-protein interactions on two data sets. On multilabel classification, our algorithm obtains the lowest Hamming losses on 10 out of 14 data sets compared to five state-of-the-art multilabel classification algorithms. We finally show that the proposed approach outperforms alternatives in multi-output regression experiments on a yeast cell cycle data set.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning such features. The central idea is to exploit the existence of landmarks, which are a subset of labeled data instances in the source domain that are distributed most similarly to the target domain. Our approach automatically discovers the landmarks and use them to bridge the source to the target by constructing provably easier auxiliary domain adaptation tasks. The solutions of those auxiliary tasks form the basis to compose invariant features for the original task. We show how this composition can be optimized discriminatively without requiring labels from the target domain. We validate the method on standard benchmark datasets for visual object recognition and sentiment analysis of text. Empirical results show the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art significantly.},

 abstract = {Non-convex sparsity-inducing penalties have recently received considerable attentions in sparse learning. Recent theoretical investigations have demonstrated their superiority over the convex counterparts in several sparse learning settings. However, solving the non-convex optimization problems associated with non-convex penalties remains a big challenge. A commonly used approach is the Multi-Stage (MS) convex relaxation (or DC programming), which relaxes the original non-convex problem to a sequence of convex problems. This approach is usually not very practical for large-scale problems because its computational cost is a multiple of solving a single convex problem. In this paper, we propose a General Iterative Shrinkage and Thresholding (GIST) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization problem for a large class of non-convex penalties. The GIST algorithm iteratively solves a proximal operator problem, which in turn has a closed-form solution for many commonly used penalties. At each outer iteration of the algorithm, we use a line search initialized by the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) rule that allows finding an appropriate step size quickly. The paper also presents a detailed convergence analysis of the GIST algorithm. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by extensive experiments on large-scale data sets.},

This is an important problem for signal acquisition and has several learning applications as well, e.g., multi-label classification (Hsu et al., 2009). We study this problem in two settings: a) support recovery: recover the support of x*, b) approximate vector recovery: recover a unit vector x such that ||x - x*||2 = e. For support recovery, we propose two novel and efficient solutions based on two combinatorial structures: union free families of sets and expanders. In contrast to existing methods for support recovery, our methods are universal i.e. a single measurement matrix A can recover all the signals. For approximate recovery, we propose the first method to recover a sparse vector using a near optimal number of measurements. We also empirically validate our algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms recover the true signal using fewer measurements than the existing methods.},

The key to average-reward computation is to have a well-defined stationary behavior of a system, so the required averages can be computed. If, additionally, the stationary behavior varies smoothly with changes in policy parameters, average-reward control through policy search also becomes a possibility. In this paper, we show that PSRs have a well-behaved stationary distribution, which is a rational function of policy parameters. Based on this result, we define a related reward process particularly suitable for average reward optimization, and analyze its properties. We show that in such a predictive state reward process, the average reward is a rational function of the policy parameters, whose complexity depends on the dimension of the underlying linear PSR. This result suggests that average reward-based policy search methods can be effective when the dimension of the system is small, even when the system representation in the POMDP framework requires many hidden states. We provide illustrative examples of this type.},

 abstract = {Can we influence how a robot is perceived by designing the sound of its movement? Drawing from practices in film sound, we overlaid a video depicting a robot's movement routine with three types of artificial movement sound. In a between-subject study design, participants saw either one of the three designs or a quiet control condition and rated the robot's movement quality, safety, capability, and attractiveness. We found that, compared to our control, the sound designs both increased and decreased perceived movement quality. Coupling the same robotic movement with different sounds lead to the motions being rated as more or less precise, elegant, jerky, or uncontrolled, among others. We further found that the sound conditions decreased perceived safety, and did not affect perceived capability and attractiveness. More unrealistic sound conditions led to larger differences in ratings, while the subtle addition of harmonic material was not rated differently to the control condition in any of the measures. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities regarding the use of artificial movement sound as an implicit channel of communication that may eventually be able to selectively target specific characteristics, helping designers in creating more refined and nuanced human-robot interactions.},

 abstract = {Multi-task learning is a paradigm shown to improve the performance of related tasks through their joint learning. However, for real-world data, it is usually difficult to assess the task relatedness and joint learning with unrelated tasks may lead to serious performance degradations. To this end, we propose a framework that groups the tasks based on their relatedness in a subspace and allows a varying degree of relatedness among tasks by sharing the subspace bases across the groups. This provides the flexibility of no sharing when two sets of tasks are unrelated and partial/total sharing when the tasks are related. Importantly, the number of task-groups and the subspace dimensionality are automatically inferred from the data. To realize our framework, we introduce a novel Bayesian nonparametric prior that extends the traditional hierarchical beta process prior using a Dirichlet process to permit potentially infinite number of child beta processes. We apply our model for multi-task regression and classification applications. Experimental results using several synthetic and real datasets show the superiority of our model to other recent multi-task learning methods.},

Computerized methods have been shown to be equally or more effective than human clinicians in diagnosing dementia from neuroimages. Nevertheless, much of the work involves the use of domain expertise to extract handcrafted features. The key technique in this paper is the use of cross-domain features to represent MRI data. We used a sparse autoencoder to learn a set of bases from natural images and then applied convolution to extract features from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Using this new representation, we classify MRI instances into three categories: Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC). Our approach, in spite of being very simple, achieved high classification performance, which is competitive with or better than other approaches.},

 abstract = {This paper describes a new online convex optimization method which incorporates a family of candidate dynamical models and establishes novel tracking regret bounds that scale with the comparator's deviation from the best dynamical model in this family. Previous online optimization methods are designed to have a total accumulated loss comparable to that of the best comparator sequence, and existing tracking or shifting regret bounds scale with the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many practical scenarios, however, the environment is non-stationary and comparator sequences with small variation are quite weak, resulting in large losses. The proposed Dynamic Mirror Descent method, in contrast, can yield low regret relative to highly variable comparator sequences by both tracking the best dynamical model and forming predictions based on that model. This concept is demonstrated empirically in the context of sequential compressive observations of a dynamic scene and tracking a dynamic social network.},

The difficulty of this learning problem is particularly acute in settings with large observation spaces and partial observability. We present a new algorithm, called Compressed Predictive State Representation (CPSR), for learning models of high-dimensional partially observable uncontrolled dynamical systems from small sample sets. The algorithm exploits a particular sparse structure present in many domains. This sparse structure is used to compress information during learning, allowing for an increase in both the efficiency and predictive power. The compression technique also relieves the burden of domain specific feature selection. We present empirical results showing that the algorithm is able to build accurate models more efficiently than its uncompressed counterparts, and we provide theoretical results on the accuracy of the learned compressed model.},

We study the scenario where the observations are drawn from non-i.i.d. processes ($m$-dependency or a more general $\phi$-mixing case). We show that COCA can allow weak dependence. In particular, we provide the generalization bounds of convergence for both support recovery and parameter estimation of COCA for the dependent data. We provide explicit sufficient conditions on the degree of dependence, under which the parametric rate can be maintained. To our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing the theoretical performance of PCA for the dependent data in high dimensional settings.

Our results show that the spectral norm of the transition matrix plays a pivotal role in determining the final rates of convergence.

However, gradient descent is only linearly efficient and not transformation invariant. Scaling by a local measure can substantially improve its performance. One natural choice of such a scale is the Hessian of the objective function: Were it available, it would turn linearly efficient gradient descent into the quadratically efficient Newton-Raphson optimization. Existing covariant methods, though, are either super-linearly expensive or do not address noise. Generalising recent results, this paper constructs a nonparametric Bayesian quasi-Newton algorithm that learns gradient and Hessian from noisy evaluations of the gradient. Importantly, the resulting algorithm, like stochastic gradient descent, has cost linear in the number of input dimensions.},

Classification tasks, in which workers provide labels (such as offensive or not offensive) for instances (such as websites), are among the most common tasks posted, but due to human error and the prevalence of spam, the labels collected are often noisy. This problem is typically addressed by collecting labels for each instance from multiple workers and combining them in a clever way, but the question of how to choose which tasks to assign to each worker is often overlooked. We investigate the problem of task assignment and label inference for heterogeneous classification tasks. By applying online primal-dual techniques, we derive a provably near-optimal adaptive assignment algorithm. We show that adaptively assigning workers to tasks can lead to more accurate predictions at a lower cost when the available workers are diverse.},

However, in many applications, features and data often originated from a Riemannian manifold that does not support a global linear (vector space) structure. Furthermore, the extrinsic viewpoint of existing dictionary learning algorithms becomes inappropriate for modeling and incorporating the intrinsic geometry of the manifold that is potentially important and critical to the application. This paper proposes a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here. We show that both the dictionary and sparse coding can be effectively computed for several important classes of Riemannian manifolds, and we validate the proposed method using two well-known classification problems in computer vision and medical imaging analysis.},

The key contribution is a novel rank characterization of the tensor associated with the marginal distribution of a quartet. This characterization allows us to design a \emph{nuclear norm} based test for resolving quartet relations. We then use the quartet test as a subroutine in a divide-and-conquer algorithm for recovering the latent tree structure. Under mild conditions, the algorithm is consistent and its error probability decays exponentially with increasing sample size. We demonstrate that the proposed approach compares favorably to alternatives.

 abstract = {We use abstract algebra to derive new algorithms for fast cross-validation, online learning, and parallel learning. To use these algorithms on a classification model, we must show that the model has appropriate algebraic structure. It is easy to give algebraic structure to some models, and we do this explicitly for Bayesian classifiers and a novel variation of decision stumps called HomStumps. But not all classifiers have an obvious structure, so we introduce the Free HomTrainer. This can be used to give a generic algebraic structure to any classifier. We use the Free HomTrainer to give algebraic structure to bagging and boosting. In so doing, we derive novel online and parallel algorithms, and present the first fast cross-validation schemes for these classifiers.},

 abstract = {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions.

On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.

We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of differentially private learning where access to the training features is through a kernel function only. As mentioned in Chaudhuri et al. (2011), the problem seems to be intractable for general kernel functions in the standard learning model of releasing different private predictor. We study this problem in three simpler but practical settings. We first study an interactive model where the user sends its test points to a trusted learner (like search engines) and expects accurate but differentially private predictions. In the second model, the learner has access to a subset of the unlabeled test set using which it releases a predictor, which preserves privacy of the training data. (NIH, 2003) is an example of such publicly available test set. Our third model is similar to the traditional model, where learner is oblivious to the test set but the kernels are restricted to functions over vector spaces. For each of the models, we derive differentially private learning algorithms with provable utility or error bounds. Moreover, we show that our methods can also be applied to the traditional model where they demonstrate better dimensionality dependence when compared to the methods of (Rubinstein et al., 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2011). Finally, we provide experimental validation of our methods.},

In this paper we analyze the classification accuracy with respect to dictionary size by linking the encoding stage to kernel methods and Nystrom sampling, and obtain useful bounds on accuracy as a function of size. The Nystrom method also inspires us to revisit dictionary learning from local patches, and we propose to learn the dictionary in an end-to-end fashion taking into account pooling, a common computational layer in vision.

We generalize Localized Multiple Kernel Learning so as to learn a tree-based primal feature embedding which is high dimensional and sparse. Primal based classification decouples prediction costs from the number of support vectors and our tree-structured features efficiently encode non-linearities while speeding up prediction exponentially over the state-of-the-art. We develop routines for optimizing over the space of tree-structured features and efficiently scale to problems with more than half a million training points. Experiments on benchmark data sets reveal that our formulation can reduce prediction costs by more than three orders of magnitude in some cases with a moderate sacrifice in classification accuracy as compared to RBF-SVMs. Furthermore, our formulation leads to better classification accuracies over leading methods.},

In this paper we provide a systematic study of the topic, and analyze the effect of delay on the regret of online learning algorithms. Somewhat surprisingly, it turns out that delay increases the regret in a multiplicative way in adversarial problems, and in an additive way in stochastic problems. We give meta-algorithms that transform, in a black-box fashion, algorithms developed for the non-delayed case into ones that can handle the presence of delays in the feedback loop. Modifications of the well-known UCB algorithm are also developed for the bandit problem with delayed feedback, with the advantage over the meta-algorithms that they can be implemented with lower complexity.},

We propose to model analogies that reflect the relationships between multiple pairs of classes simultaneously, in the form p is to q, as r is to s. We translate semantic analogies into higher-order geometric constraints called analogical parallelograms, and use them in a novel convex regularizer for a discriminatively learned label embedding. Furthermore, we show how to discover analogies from attribute-based class descriptions, and how to prioritize those likely to reduce inter-class confusion. Evaluating our Analogy-preserving Semantic Embedding (ASE) on two visual recognition datasets, we demonstrate clear improvements over existing approaches, both in terms of recognition accuracy and analogy completion.},

This kernel operates on the output space and encodes the interactions between the outputs without any reference to the input space. To address this issue, we introduce a variant of our KDE method based on the conditional covariance operator that in addition to the correlation between the outputs takes into account the effects of the input variables. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our KDE approach using both covariance and conditional covariance kernels on two structured output problems, and compare it to the state-of-the-art kernel-based structured output regression methods.},

Recent work has shown how certain autoencoders can assign an unnormalized to data which measures how well the autoencoder can represent the data. Scores are commonly computed by using training criteria that relate the autoencoder to a probabilistic model, such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine. In this paper we show how an autoencoder can assign meaningful scores to data independently of training procedure and without reference to any probabilistic model, by interpreting it as a dynamical system. We discuss how, and under which conditions, running the dynamical system can be viewed as performing gradient descent in an energy function, which in turn allows us to derive a score via integration. We also show how one can combine multiple, unnormalized scores into a generative classifier.},

Hence, an ideal network should be able to 1) gradually learn a set of patterns, 2) retrieve the correct pattern from noisy queries and 3) maximize the number of memorized patterns while maintaining the reliability in responding to queries. We show that by considering the inherent redundancy in the memorized patterns, one can obtain all the mentioned properties at once. This is in sharp contrast with previous work that could only improve one or two aspects at the expense of the others. More specifically, we devise an iterative algorithm that learns the redundancy among the patterns. The resulting network has a retrieval capacity that is exponential in the size of the network. Lastly, by considering the local structures of the network, the asymptotic error correction performance can be made linear in the size of the network.},

The models we consider can be viewed as special (finite-dimensional) instances of hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs). For these models we show that there exists a simple variational approximation for probabilistic inference. The approximation relies on a previously unexploited inequality that handles the conditional dependence between Dirichlet latent variables in adjacent levels of the model's hierarchy. We compare our approach to existing implementations of nonparametric HDPs. On several benchmarks we find that our approach is faster than Gibbs sampling and able to learn more predictive models than existing variational methods. Finally, we demonstrate the large-scale viability of our approach on two newly available corpora from researchers in computer security-- one with 350,000 documents and over 6,000 internal subcategories, the other with a five-level deep hierarchy.},

 abstract = {Many real world network problems often concern multivariate nodal attributes such as image, textual, and multi-view feature vectors on nodes, rather than simple univariate nodal attributes. The existing graph estimation methods built on Gaussian graphical models and covariance selection algorithms can not handle such data, neither can the theories developed around such methods be directly applied. In this paper, we propose a new principled framework for estimating multi-attribute graphs. Instead of estimating the partial correlation as in current literature, our method estimates the partial canonical correlations that naturally accommodate complex nodal features. Computationally, we provide an efficient algorithm which utilizes the multi-attribute structure. Theoretically, we provide sufficient conditions which guarantee consistent graph recovery. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate performance of our method under various conditions.},

 abstract = {We present a novel approach for learning an HMM whose outputs are distributed according to a parametric family. This is done by {\em decoupling} the learning task into two steps: first estimating the output parameters, and then estimating the hidden states transition probabilities. The first step is accomplished by fitting a mixture model to the output stationary distribution. Given the parameters of this mixture model, the second step is formulated as the solution of an easily solvable convex quadratic program. We provide an error analysis for the estimated transition probabilities and show they are robust to small perturbations in the estimates of the mixture parameters. Finally, we support our analysis with some encouraging empirical results.},

We start by modeling the rich spatio-temporal relations between human poses and objects (called affordances) using a conditional random field (CRF). However, because of the ambiguity in the temporal segmentation of the sub-activities that constitute an activity, in the past as well as in the future, multiple graph structures are possible. In this paper, we reason about these alternate possibilities by reasoning over multiple possible graph structures. We obtain them by approximating the graph with only additive features, which lends to efficient dynamic programming. Starting with this proposal graph structure, we then design moves to obtain several other likely graph structures. We then show that our approach improves the state-of-the-art significantly for detecting past activities as well as for anticipating future activities, on a dataset of 120 activity videos collected from four subjects.},

It has recently been shown that mean field inference in dense random fields can be performed efficiently and that these models enable significant accuracy gains in computer vision applications. However, parameter estimation for dense random fields is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm for learning parameters in dense random fields. All parameters are estimated jointly, thus capturing dependencies between them. We show that gradients of a variety of loss functions over the mean field marginals can be computed efficiently. The resulting algorithm learns parameters that directly optimize the performance of mean field inference in the model.

 abstract = {Deep belief networks (DBNs) can approximate any distribution over fixed-length binary vectors. However, DBNs are frequently applied to model real-valued data, and so far little is known about their representational power in this case. We analyze the approximation properties of DBNs with two layers of binary hidden units and visible units with conditional distributions from the exponential family. It is shown that these DBNs can, under mild assumptions, model any additive mixture of distributions from the exponential family with independent variables. An arbitrarily good approximation in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence of an m-dimensional mixture distribution with n components can be achieved by a DBN with m visible variables and n and n + 1 hidden variables in the first and second hidden layer, respectively. Furthermore, relevant infinite mixtures can be approximated arbitrarily well by a DBN with a finite number of neurons. This includes the important special case of an infinite mixture of Gaussian distributions with fixed variance restricted to a compact domain, which in turn can approximate any strictly positive density over this domain.},

We derive the distance between ellipsoids and the hyperplane, generalising the standard support vector machine. Negative bags in MIL contain only negative instances, and we treat them akin to uncertain observations in the robust optimisation framework. However, our method allows positive bags to cross the margin, since it is not known which instances within are positive.

We show that representing bags as ellipsoids under the introduced distance is the most robust solution when treating a bag as a random variable with finite mean and covariance. Two algorithms are derived to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem: a concave-convex procedure and a quasi-Newton method. Our method achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets. We introduce a MIL dataset from a real world application of detecting wheel defects from multiple partial observations, and show that eMIL outperforms competing approaches.},

We show that the relatedness of source and target domains accelerates the convergence of the Leave-One-Out error to the generalization error, thus enabling the use of the Leave-One-Out error to find the optimal transfer parameters, even in the presence of a small training set.

Given a set of triplets that encode the pairwise proximity comparison information, our method learns hash functions that preserve the relative comparison relationships in the data as well as possible within the large-margin learning framework. The learning procedure is implemented using column generation and hence is named CGHash. At each iteration of the column generation procedure, the best hash function is selected. Unlike most other hashing methods, our method generalizes to new data points naturally; and has a training objective which is convex, thus ensuring that the global optimum can be identified. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method learns compact binary codes and that its retrieval performance compares favorably with state-of-the-art methods when tested on a few benchmark datasets.},

 abstract = {Metric learning algorithms produce a linear transformation of data which is optimized for a prediction task, such as nearest-neighbor classification or ranking. However, when the input data contains a large portion of noninformative features, existing methods fail to identify the relevant features, and performance degrades accordingly. In this paper, we present an efficient and robust structural metric learning algorithm which enforces group sparsity on the learned transformation, while optimizing for structured ranking output prediction. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods in both high- and low-noise settings.},

 abstract = {We consider the following signal recovery problem: given a measurement matrix Φ ∈ Rn×p and a noisy observation vector c ∈ Rn constructed from c = Φθ* + e where e ∈ Rn is the noise vector whose entries follow i.i.d. centered sub-Gaussian distribution, how to recover the signal θ* if Dθ* is sparse under a linear transformation D ∈ Rm×p? One natural method using convex optimization is to solve the following problem: min θ 1/2||Φθ - c||2 + λ||Dθ||1. This paper provides an upper bound of the estimate error and shows the consistency property of this method by assuming that the design matrix Φ is a Gaussian random matrix. Specifically, we show 1) in the noiseless case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement number n ≥ Ω(s log(p)) where s is the sparsity number, then the true solution can be recovered with high probability; and 2) in the noisy case, if the condition number of D is bounded and the measurement increases faster than s log(p), that is, s log(p) = o(n), the estimate error converges to zero with probability 1 when p and s go to infinity. Our results are consistent with those for the special case D = Ip×p (equivalently LASSO) and improve the existing analysis. The condition number of D plays a critical role in our analysis. We consider the condition numbers in two cases including the fused LASSO and the random graph: the condition number in the fused LASSO case is bounded by a constant, while the condition number in the random graph case is bounded with high probability if m/p (i.e., #edge/#vertex) is larger than a certain constant. Numerical simulations are consistent with our theoretical results.},

 abstract = {Structured predictors enable joint inference over multiple interdependent output variables. These models are often trained on a small number of examples with large internal structure. Existing distribution-free generalization bounds do not guarantee generalization in this setting, though this contradicts a large body of empirical evidence from computer vision, natural language processing, social networks and other fields. In this paper, we identify a set of natural conditions-- weak dependence, hypothesis complexity and a new measure, collective stability--that are sufficient for generalization from even a single example, without imposing an explicit generative model of the data. We then demonstrate that the complexity and stability conditions are satisfied by a broad class of models, including marginal inference in templated graphical models. We thus obtain uniform convergence rates that can decrease significantly faster than previous bounds, particularly when each structured example is sufficiently large and the number of training examples is constant, even one.},

 abstract = {A consistent loss function for multiclass classification is one such that for any source of labeled examples, any tuple of scoring functions that minimizes the expected loss will have classification accuracy close to that of the Bayes optimal classifier. While consistency has been proposed as a desirable property for multiclass loss functions, we give experimental and theoretical results exhibiting a sequence of linearly separable data sources with the following property: a multiclass classification algorithm which optimizes a loss function due to Crammer and Singer (which is known not to be consistent) produces classifiers whose expected error goes to 0, while the expected error of an algorithm which optimizes a generalization of the loss function used by LogitBoost (a loss function which is known to be consistent) is bounded below by a positive constant.

We identify a property of a loss function, realizable consistency with respect to a restricted class of scoring functions, that accounts for this difference. As our main technical results we show that the Crammer-Singer loss function is realizable consistent for the class of linear scoring functions, while the generalization of LogitBoost is not. Our result for LogitBoost is a special case of a more general theorem that applies to several other loss functions that have been proposed for multiclass classification.},

 abstract = {In the theory of compressed sensing (CS), the sparsity ||x||_0 of the unknown signal x\in\R^p is commonly assumed to be a known parameter. However, it is typically unknown in practice. Due to the fact that many aspects of CS depend on knowing ||x||_0, it is important to estimate this parameter in a data-driven way. A second practical concern is that ||x||_0 is a highly unstable function of x. In particular, for real signals with entries not exactly equal to 0, the value ||x||_0=p is not a useful description of the effective number of coordinates. In this paper, we propose to estimate a stable measure of sparsity s(x):=||x||_1^2/||x||_2^2, which is a sharp lower bound on ||x||_0. Our estimation procedure uses only a small number of linear measurements, does not rely on any sparsity assumptions, and requires very little computation. A confidence interval for s(x) is provided, and its width is shown to have no dependence on the signal dimension p. Moreover, this result extends naturally to the matrix recovery setting, where a soft version of matrix rank can be estimated with analogous guarantees. Finally, we show that the use of randomized measurements is essential to estimating s(x). This is accomplished by proving that the minimax risk for estimating s(x) with deterministic measurements is large when n<<p.},

Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference, it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent from its conditioning variables. In this paper, we relax this assumption by discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula given its conditioning variables We learn these functions by following a Bayesian approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that, when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the underlying copula of the data.},

This process is not assumed to be a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Rather, the agent has several representations (mapping histories of past interactions to a discrete state space) of the environment with unknown dynamics, only some of which result in an MDP. The goal is to minimize the average regret criterion against an agent who knows an MDP representation giving the highest optimal reward, and acts optimally in it. Recent regret bounds for this setting are of order $O(T^{2/3})$ with an additive term constant yet exponential in some characteristics of the optimal MDP. We propose an algorithm whose regret after $T$ time steps is $O(\sqrt{T})$, with all constants reasonably small. This is optimal in $T$ since $O(\sqrt{T})$ is the optimal regret in the setting of learning in a (single discrete) MDP.},

In this paper, we study consistency with respect to one such performance measure, namely the arithmetic mean of the true positive and true negative rates (AM), and establish that some practically popular approaches, such as applying an empirically determined threshold to a suitable class probability estimate or performing an empirically balanced form of risk minimization, are in fact consistent with respect to the AM (under mild conditions on the underlying distribution).

 abstract = {The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a widely used performance measure in machine learning. Increasingly, however, in several applications, ranging from ranking and biometric screening to medical diagnosis, performance is measured not in terms of the full area under the ROC curve, but instead, in terms of the partial area under the ROC curve between two specified false positive rates. In this paper, we develop a structural SVM framework for directly optimizing the partial AUC between any two false positive rates. Our approach makes use of a cutting plane solver along the lines of the structural SVM based approach for optimizing the full AUC developed by Joachims (2005). Unlike the full AUC, where the combinatorial optimization problem needed to find the most violated constraint in the cutting plane solver can be decomposed easily to yield an efficient algorithm, the corresponding optimization problem in the case of partial AUC is harder to decompose. One of our key technical contributions is an efficient algorithm for solving this combinatorial optimization problem that has the same computational complexity as Joachims' algorithm for optimizing the usual AUC. This allows us to efficiently optimize the partial AUC in any desired false positive range. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of real-world tasks.},

 abstract = {While convex losses for binary classification are attractive due to the existence of numerous (provably) efficient methods for finding their global optima, they are sensitive to outliers. On the other hand, while the nonconvex 0-1 loss is robust to outliers, it is NP-hard to optimize and thus rarely directly optimized in practice. In this paper, however, we do just that: we explore a variety of practical methods for direct (approximate) optimization of the 0-1 loss based on branch and bound search, combinatorial search, and coordinate descent on smooth, differentiable relaxations of 0-1 loss. Empirically, we compare our proposed algorithms to logistic regression, SVM, and the Bayes point machine showing that the proposed 0-1 loss optimization algorithms perform at least as well and offer a clear advantage in the presence of outliers. To this end, we believe this work reiterates the importance of 0-1 loss and its robustness properties while challenging the notion that it is difficult to directly optimize.},

Training S3VM involves either a combinatorial or non-convex optimization problem and thus finding the global optimal solution is intractable in practice. It has been demonstrated that a key to successfully find a good (local) solution of S3VM is to gradually increase the effect of unlabeled data, a la annealing. However, existing algorithms suffer from the trade-off between the resolution of annealing steps and the computation cost. In this paper, we go beyond this trade-off by proposing a novel training algorithm that efficiently performs annealing with an infinitesimal resolution. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed infinitesimal annealing algorithm tends to produce better solutions with less computation time than existing approaches.},

We study the dependence of the statistical ranking problem on the available pairwise data, i.e., pairs (i,j) for which the pairwise comparison data yij is known, and propose a framework to identify data which, when augmented with the current dataset, maximally increases the Fisher information of the ranking. Under certain assumptions, the data collection problem decouples, reducing to a problem of finding an edge set on the graph (with a fixed number of edges) such that the second eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian is maximal. This reduction of the data collection problem to a spectral graph-theoretic question is one of the primary contributions of this work. As an application, we study the Yahoo!

Our algorithm applies to a more general class of convex and nonsmooth objective functions, beyond the smooth and separable least squares loss used in lasso. We also demonstrate the rates of convergence for our algorithm under various structural assumptions of the stochastic function: O(1/√t)) for convex functions and O(log t/t) for strongly convex functions. Compared to previous literature, we establish the convergence rate of ADMM for convex problems in terms of both the objective value and the feasibility violation.

We obtain provable approximation guarantees that depend on the spectral decay profile of the matrix: the faster the eigenvalue decay, the better the quality of our approximation. For example, if the eigenvalues of $A$ follow a power-law decay, we obtain a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any desired accuracy. A key algorithmic component of our scheme is a combinatorial feature elimination step that is provably safe and in practice significantly reduces the running complexity of our algorithm. We implement our algorithm and test it on multiple artificial and real data sets. Due to the feature elimination step, it is possible to perform sparse PCA on data sets consisting of millions of entries in a few minutes. Our experimental evaluation shows that our scheme is nearly optimal while finding very sparse vectors. We compare to the prior state of the art and show that our scheme matches or outperforms previous algorithms in all tested data sets.},

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach of hybrid generative-discriminative learning for Bayesian networks. We use an SVM-type large margin formulation for discriminative training, introducing a likelihood-weighted l1-norm for the SVM-norm-penalization. This simultaneously optimizes the data likelihood and therefore partly maintains the generative character of the model. For many network structures, our method can be formulated as a convex problem, guaranteeing a globally optimal solution. In terms of classification, the resulting models outperform state-of-the art generative and discriminative learning methods for Bayesian networks, and are comparable with linear and kernelized SVMs. Furthermore, the models achieve likelihoods close to the maximum likelihood solution and show robust behavior in classification experiments with missing features.},

 abstract = {Linear classifiers are much faster to learn and test than non-linear ones. On the other hand, non-linear kernels offer improved performance, albeit at the increased cost of training kernel classifiers. To use non-linear mappings with efficient linear learning algorithms, explicit embeddings that approximate popular kernels have recently been proposed. However, the embedding process is often costly and the results are usually less accurate than kernel methods. In this work we propose a non-linear feature map that is both very efficient, but at the same time highly expressive. The method is based on discretization and interpolation of individual features values and feature pairs. The discretization allows us to model different regions of the feature space separately, while the interpolation preserves the original continuous values. Using this embedding is strictly more general than a linear model and as efficient as the second-order polynomial explicit feature map. An extensive empirical evaluation shows that our method consistently outperforms other methods, including a wide range of kernels. This is in contrast to other proposed embeddings that were faster than kernel methods, but with lower accuracy.},

To address this issue, we propose an approximate inference method, relaxed expectation propagation (REP), based on a new divergence with al1 penalty. Minimizing this penalized divergence adaptively relaxes EP’s moment matching requirement for message passing. We apply REP to Gaussian process classication and experimental results demonstrate signicant improvement of REP over EP and -divergence based power EP|in terms of algorithmic stability, estimation accuracy and predictive performance. Furthermore, we develop relaxed belief propagation (RBP), a special case of REP, to conduct inference on discrete Markov random elds (MRFs).

In particular, we explore how presenting users with slightly perturbed objects (e.g., rankings) can stabilize the learning process.

Specifically, we prove that if f grows at least as fast as ‖x − xf,S‖ around its minimum, for some κ > 1, then the optimal rate of learning f(xf,S) is Θ(T − κ 2κ−2 ). The classic rate Θ(1/ √ T ) for convex functions and Θ(1/T ) for strongly convex functions are special cases of our result for κ→∞ and κ = 2, and even faster rates are attained for κ < 2. We also derive tight bounds for the complexity of learning xf,S , where the optimal rate is Θ(T− 1 2κ−2 ). Interestingly, these precise rates for convex optimization also characterize the complexity of active learning and our results further strengthen the connections between the two fields, both of which rely on feedback-driven queries.},

However, the algorithm is sensitive to that rate, which usually requires hand-tuning to each application. We solve this problem by developing an adaptive learning rate for stochastic variational inference. Our method requires no tuning and is easily implemented with computations already made in the algorithm. We demonstrate our approach with latent Dirichlet allocation applied to three large text corpora. Inference with the adaptive learning rate converges faster and to a better approximation than the best settings of hand-tuned rates.},

It is known their minimum values are monotone with respect to the input number of clusters and this monotonicity does not allow for a simple automatic selection of a correct number of clusters. Here we study monotonicity not just on the minimizers but on the entire clustering lattice. We show the value of Sum of Squares Error is strictly monotone under the strict refinement relation of clusterings and we obtain data-dependent bounds on the difference between the value of a clustering and one of its refinements. Using analogous techniques we show the value of Normalized Cut is strictly anti-monotone. These results imply that even if we restrict our solutions to form a chain of clustering, like the one we get from hierarchical algorithms, we cannot rely on the functional values in order to choose the number of clusters. By using these results we get some data-dependent bounds on the difference of the values of any two clusterings.},

In this work, we use Kurihara & Welling (2008)'s maximization-expectation framework to perform approximate MAP inference for linear-Gaussian latent feature models with an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior. This formulation yields a submodular function of the features that corresponds to a lower bound on the model evidence. By adding a constant to this function, we obtain a nonnegative submodular function that can be maximized via a greedy algorithm that obtains at least a one-third approximation to the optimal solution. Our inference method scales linearly with the size of the input data, and we show the efficacy of our method on the largest datasets currently analyzed using an IBP model.},

The nonparametric nature of our algorithm allows for learning the unknown number of meaningful trajectories.

Further using the learned model to study properties of influence, we find that musical influence and musical innovation are not monotonically correlated.

While it has already been theoretically studied for decades, the classical analysis usually required non-trivial smoothness assumptions, which do not apply to many modern applications of SGD with non-smooth objective functions such as support vector machines. In this paper, we investigate the performance of SGD without such smoothness assumptions, as well as a running average scheme to convert the SGD iterates to a solution with optimal optimization accuracy. In this framework, we prove that after T rounds, the suboptimality of the last SGD iterate scales as O(log(T)/√T) for non-smooth convex objective functions, and O(log(T)/T) in the non-smooth strongly convex case. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first bounds of this kind, and almost match the minimax-optimal rates obtainable by appropriate averaging schemes. We also propose a new and simple averaging scheme, which not only attains optimal rates, but can also be easily computed on-the-fly (in contrast, the suffix averaging scheme proposed in Rakhlin et al. (2011) is not as simple to implement). Finally, we provide some experimental illustrations.},

In fact, we have good opportunities to find novel and important kernels in the unexplored area. In this paper, we shed light on a novel important class of kernels within the framework: We give a mathematical characterization of the class, and then, based on the characterization, we show a parametric method to optimize kernels of the class to specific problems.

We present the first framework for concurrent reinforcement learning, using a variant of temporal-difference learning to learn efficiently from partial interaction sequences.

Such cost functions are useful for Nonnegative Matrix and Tensor Factorization models with a compound Poisson observation model. Compound Poisson is a particular Tweedie model, an important special case of exponential dispersion models characterized by the fact that the variance is proportional to a power function of the mean. There are several well known matrix and tensor factorization algorithms that minimize the β-divergence; these estimate the mean parameter. The probabilistic interpretation gives us more exibility and robustness by providing us additional tunable parameters such as power and dispersion. Estimation of the power parameter is useful for choosing a suitable divergence and estimation of dispersion is useful for data driven regularization and weighting in collective/coupled factorization of heterogeneous datasets. We present three inference algorithms for both estimating the factors and the additional parameters of the compound Poisson distribution. The methods are evaluated on two applications: modeling symbolic representations for polyphonic music and lyric prediction from audio features. Our conclusion is that the compound poisson based factorization models can be useful for sparse positive data.},

 abstract = {Unsupervised feature learning has emerged as a promising tool in learning representations from unlabeled data. However, it is still challenging to learn useful high-level features when the data contains a significant amount of irrelevant patterns. Although feature selection can be used for such complex data, it may fail when we have to build a learning system from scratch (i.e., starting from the lack of useful raw features). To address this problem, we propose a point-wise gated Boltzmann machine, a unified generative model that combines feature learning and feature selection. Our model performs not only feature selection on learned high-level features (i.e., hidden units), but also dynamic feature selection on raw features (i.e., visible units) through a gating mechanism. For each example, the model can adaptively focus on a variable subset of visible nodes corresponding to the task-relevant patterns, while ignoring the visible units corresponding to the task-irrelevant patterns. In experiments, our method achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art in several visual recognition benchmarks. },

 abstract = {We approach the problem of estimating the parameters of a latent tree graphical model from a hierarchical tensor decomposition point of view. In this new view, the marginal probability table of the observed variables is treated as a tensor, and we show that: (i) the latent variables induce low rank structures in various matricizations of the tensor; (ii) this collection of low rank matricizations induces a hierarchical low rank decomposition of the tensor. We further derive an optimization problem for estimating (alternative) parameters of a latent tree graphical model, allowing us to represent the marginal probability table of the observed variables in a compact and robust way. The optimization problem aims to find the best hierarchical low rank approximation of a tensor in Frobenius norm.

For correctly specified latent tree graphical models, we show that a global optimum of the optimization problem can be obtained via a recursive decomposition algorithm. This algorithm recovers previous spectral algorithms for hidden Markov models (Hsu et al., 2009; Foster et al., 2012) and latent tree graphical models (Parikh et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011) as special cases, elucidating the global objective these algorithms are optimizing. For misspecified latent tree graphical models, we derive a novel decomposition based on our framework, and provide approximation guarantee and computational complexity analysis. In both synthetic and real world data, this new estimator significantly improves over the state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {For a well trained Boosting classifier, we are interested in how to save the testing time, i.e., to make the decision without evaluating all the base learners. To address this problem, in previous work the base learners are sequentially calculated and early stopping is allowed if the decision function has been confident enough to output its value. In such a chain structure, the order of base learners is critical: better order can lead to less evaluation time.

In this paper, we present a novel method for ordering. We base our discussion on the data structure representing Boosting's decision function. Viewing the decision function a boolean expression, we propose a Binary Valued Tree for its representation. As a secondary contribution, such a representation unifies the work by previous researchers and helps devise new representation. Also, its connection to Binary Decision Diagram(BDD) is discussed.},

 abstract = {Deep and recurrent neural networks (DNNs and RNNs respectively) are powerful models that were considered to be almost impossible to train using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. In this paper, we show that when stochastic gradient descent with momentum uses a well-designed random initialization and a particular type of slowly increasing schedule for the momentum parameter, it can train both DNNs and RNNs (on datasets with long-term dependencies) to levels of performance that were previously achievable only with Hessian-Free optimization. We find that both the initialization and the momentum are crucial since poorly initialized networks cannot be trained with momentum and well-initialized networks perform markedly worse when the momentum is absent or poorly tuned.

Our success training these models suggests that previous attempts to train deep and recurrent neural networks from random initializations have likely failed due to poor initialization schemes. Furthermore, carefully tuned momentum methods suffice for dealing with the curvature issues in deep and recurrent network training objectives without the need for sophisticated second-order methods.},

Each observation results from evaluating an imperfect classifier of a chosen cost and accuracy on an interval of chosen length and position. Within a Bayesian framework, we study the problem of minimizing an objective that combines the entropy of the posterior distribution with the cost of the questions asked. In this problem, we show that the one-step lookahead policy is Bayes-optimal for any arbitrary time horizon. Moreover, this one-step lookahead policy is easy to compute and implement. We then use this policy in the context of localizing mitochondria in electron microscope images, and experimentally show that significant speed ups in acquisition can be gained, while maintaining near equal image quality at target locations, when compared to current policies.},

 abstract = {The multi-armed bandit problem has attracted remarkable attention in the machine learning community and many efficient algorithms have been proposed to handle the so-called exploitation-exploration dilemma in various bandit setups. At the same time, significantly less effort has been devoted to adapting bandit algorithms to particular architectures, such as sensor networks, multicore machines, or peer-to-peer (P2P) environments, which could potentially speed up their convergence. Our goal is to adapt stochastic bandit algorithms to P2P networks. In our setup, the same set of arms is available in each peer. In every iteration each peer can pull one arm independently of the other peers, and then some limited communication is possible with a few random other peers. As our main result, we show that our adaptation achieves a linear speedup in terms of the number of peers participating in the network. More precisely, we show that the probability of playing a suboptimal arm at a peer in iteration t = Ω(log N) is proportional to 1/(Nt) where N denotes the number of peers. The theoretical results are supported by simulation experiments showing that our algorithm scales gracefully with the size of network.},

In this model the energy of a string (labeling) $$x_1\ldots x_n$$ is the sum of terms over intervals [i, j] where each term is non-zero only if the substring $$x_i\ldots x_j$$ equals a prespecified pattern w. Such CRFs can be naturally applied to many sequence tagging problems. We present efficient algorithms for the three standard inference tasks in a CRF, namely computing (i) the partition function, (ii) marginals, and (iii) computing the MAP. Their complexities are respectively $$O(\textit{nL})$$ , $$O(\textit{nL} \ell _{\max })$$ and $$O(\textit{nL} \min \{|D|,\log (\ell _{\max }\!+\!1)\})$$ where L is the combined length of input patterns, $$\ell _{\max }$$ is the maximum length of a pattern, and D is the input alphabet. This improves on the previous algorithms of Ye et al. (NIPS, 2009) whose complexities are respectively $$O(\textit{nL} |D|)$$ , $$O\left( n |\varGamma | L^2 \ell _{\max }^2\right) $$ and $$O(\textit{nL} |D|)$$ , where $$|\varGamma |$$ is the number of input patterns.

 abstract = {Neighborhood Components Analysis (NCA) is a popular method for learning a distance metric to be used within a k-nearest neighbors (kNN) classifier. A key assumption built into the model is that each point stochastically selects a single neighbor, which makes the model well-justified only for kNN with k = 1. However, kNN classifiers with k > 1 are more robust and usually preferred in practice. Here we present kNCA, which generalizes NCA by learning distance metrics that are appropriate for kNN with arbitrary k. The main technical contribution is showing how to efficiently compute and optimize the expected accuracy of a kNN classifier. We apply similar ideas in an unsupervised setting to yield kSNE and kt-SNE, generalizations of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE, t-SNE) that operate on neighborhoods of size k, which provide an axis of control over embeddings that allow for more homogeneous and interpretable regions. Empirically, we show that kNCA often improves classification accuracy over state of the art methods, produces qualitative differences in the embeddings as k is varied, and is more robust with respect to label noise.},

We consider a very weak assumption on the function, namely that it is locally smooth (in some precise sense) with respect to some semi-metric, around one of its global maxima. Compared to previous works on bandits in general spaces (Kleinberg et al., 2008; Bubeck et al., 2011a) our algorithm does not require the knowledge of this semi-metric. Our algorithm, StoSOO, follows an optimistic strategy to iteratively construct upper confidence bounds over the hierarchical partitions of the function domain to decide which point to sample next. A finite-time analysis of StoSOO shows that it performs almost as well as the best specifically-tuned algorithms even though the local smoothness of the function is not known.},

 abstract = {The goal of machine learning is to develop predictors that generalize well to test data. Ideally, this is achieved by training on very large (infinite) training data sets that capture all variations in the data distribution. In the case of finite training data, an effective solution is to extend the training set with artificially created examples--which, however, is also computationally costly. We propose to corrupt training examples with noise from known distributions within the exponential family and present a novel learning algorithm, called marginalized corrupted features (MCF), that trains robust predictors by minimizing the expected value of the loss function under the corrupting distribution-- essentially learning with infinitely many (corrupted) training examples. We show empirically on a variety of data sets that MCF classifiers can be trained efficiently, may generalize substantially better to test data, and are more robust to feature deletion at test time.},

Traditionally, the main planning operation is a full backup based on the current estimates of the successor states. Consequently, its computation time is proportional to the number of successor states. In this paper, we introduce a new planning backup that uses only the current value of a single successor state and has a computation time independent of the number of successor states. This new backup, which we call a small backup, opens the door to a new class of model-based reinforcement learning methods that exhibit much finer control over their planning process than traditional methods. We empirically demonstrate that this increased flexibility allows for more efficient planning by showing that an implementation of prioritized sweeping based on small backups achieves a substantial performance improvement over classical implementations.},

This gives very good that adapt locally to the data but are harder to compute. We study the mathematical properties of these entropic affinities and show that they implicitly define a continuously differentiable function in the input space and give bounds for it. We then devise a fast algorithm to compute the widths and affinities, based on robustified, quickly convergent root-finding methods combined with a tree-or density-based initialization scheme that exploits the slowly-varying behavior of this function. This algorithm is nearly optimal and much more accurate and fast than the existing bisection-based approach, particularly with large datasets, as we show with image and text data.},

Dropout training (Hinton et al., 2012) does this by randomly dropping out (zeroing) hidden units and input features during training of neural networks. However, repeatedly sampling a random subset of input features makes training much slower. Based on an examination of the implied objective function of dropout training, we show how to do fast dropout training by sampling from or integrating a Gaussian approximation, instead of doing Monte Carlo optimization of this objective. This approximation, justified by the central limit theorem and empirical evidence, gives an order of magnitude speedup and more stability. We show how to do fast dropout training for classification, regression, and multilayer neural networks. Beyond dropout, our technique is extended to integrate out other types of noise and small image transformations.},

Recent advances revealed that its convergent versions (such as MPLP, MSD, TRW-S) can be viewed as performing block coordinate descent (BCD) in a dual objective. That is, each BCD step achieves dual-optimal w.r.t. a block of dual variables (messages), thereby decreases the dual objective monotonically. However, most existing algorithms are limited to updating blocks selected in rather restricted ways. In this paper, we show a unified message passing algorithm that: (a) subsumes MPLP, MSD, and TRW-S as special cases when applied to their respective choices of dual objective and blocks, and (b) is able to perform BCD under much more flexible choices of blocks (including very large blocks) as well as the dual objective itself (that arise from an arbitrary dual decomposition).},

Most previous studies employ kernels or graphs to integrate different types of features, which routinely assume one weight for one type of features. However, for many problems, the importance of features in one source to an individual cluster of data can be varied, which makes the previous approaches ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view learning model to integrate all features and learn the weight for every feature with respect to each cluster individually via new joint structured sparsity-inducing norms. The proposed multi-view learning framework allows us not only to perform clustering tasks, but also to deal with classification tasks by an extension when the labeling knowledge is available. A new efficient algorithm is derived to solve the formulated objective with rigorous theoretical proof on its convergence. We applied our new data fusion method to five broadly used multi-view data sets for both clustering and classification. In all experimental results, our method clearly outperforms other related state-of-the-art methods.},

Existing approaches in dictionary (codebook) learning are either generative (unsupervised e.g. k-means) or discriminative (supervised e.g. extremely randomized forests). In this paper, we propose a multiple instance learning (MIL) strategy (along the line of weakly supervised learning) for dictionary learning. Each code is represented by a classifier, such as a linear SVM, which naturally performs metric fusion for multi-channel features. We design a formulation to simultaneously learn mixtures of codes by maximizing classification margins in MIL.

In this paper, we present a fast and exact algorithm for energy minimization in cycle MRFs, which can be used as a subroutine in tackling general MRFs. Our method builds on junction-tree message passing, with a large portion of the message entries pruned for efficiency. The pruning conditions fully exploit the structure of a cycle.

To address this, we propose a novel robust and discriminative self-taught learning approach to utilize any unlabeled data without the above restrictions. Our new approach employs a robust loss function to learn the dictionary, and enforces the structured sparse regularization to automatically select the optimal dictionary basis vectors and incorporate the supervision information contained in the labeled data.

Optimization algorithms (e.g., the SVM) could be used to predict a ranking with fixed expected Kendall tau distance, while achieving an Ω (n) lower bound on the corresponding sample complexity. However, due to their centralized structure they are difficult to extend to online or distributed settings. In this paper we show that much simpler algorithms can match the same Ω (n) lower bound in expectation. Furthermore, if an average of O(n log(n)) binary comparisons are measured, then one algorithm recovers the true ranking in a uniform sense, while the other predicts the ranking more accurately near the top than the bottom.

Given a finite dictionary of words, our extended LDA model allows for the soft assignment of descriptors to (many) dictionary words. We derive variational inference and parameter estimation procedures for the extended model, which closely resemble those obtained for the original model, with two important differences: First, the histogram of word counts is replaced by a histogram of pseudo word counts, or sums of responsibilities over all descriptors. Second, parameter estimation now depends on the average covariance matrix between these pseudocounts, reflecting the fact that with soft assignment words are not independent. We use this approach to address the detection of novel video events, where we seek to identify video events with low posterior probability. Using a benchmark dataset for novelty detection, we show a very significant improvement in the detection of novel events when using our extended LDA model with soft assignment to words as against hard assignment (the original model), achieving state of the art novelty detection results.},

Straightforward hidden Markov model (HMM) analyses attempt to characterize such processes in terms of a set of conformational states, the transitions that can occur between these states, and the associated rates at which those transitions occur; but require ad-hoc post-processing steps to combine multiple signals.  Here we develop a hierarchically coupled HMM that allows experimentalists to deal with inter-signal variability in a principled and automatic way.

 abstract = {Nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process are an elegant alternative to finite models when the number of underlying components is unknown, but inference in such models can be slow. Existing attempts to parallelize inference in such models have relied on introducing approximations, which can lead to inaccuracies in the posterior estimate. In this paper, we describe auxiliary variable representations for the Dirichlet process and the hierarchical Dirichlet process that allow us to perform MCMC using the correct equilibrium distribution, in a distributed manner. We show that our approach allows scalable inference without the deterioration in estimate quality that accompanies existing methods.},

 abstract = {Gaussian processes are rich distributions over functions, which provide a Bayesian nonparametric approach to smoothing and interpolation. We introduce simple closed form kernels that can be used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns and enable extrapolation. These kernels are derived by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture. The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian process inference remains simple and analytic. We demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also show that we can reconstruct standard covariances within our framework.},

 abstract = {An effective approach to structure learning and parameter estimation for Gaussian graphical models is to impose a sparsity prior, such as a Laplace prior, on the entries of the precision matrix. Such an approach involves a hyperparameter that must be tuned to control the amount of sparsity. In this paper, we introduce a parameter-free method for estimating a precision matrix with sparsity that adapts to the data automatically. We achieve this by formulating a hierarchical Bayesian model of the precision matrix with a non-informative Jeffreysâ hyperprior. We also naturally enforce the symmetry and positive-definiteness constraints on the precision matrix by parameterizing it with the Cholesky decomposition. Experiments on simulated and real (cell signaling) data demonstrate that the proposed approach not only automatically adapts the sparsity of the model, but it also results in improved estimates of the precision matrix compared to the Laplace prior model with sparsity parameter chosen by cross-validation.},

However, some of the most popular models suffer from a) overfitting problems and multiple local optima, b) failure to capture shifts in market conditions and c) large computational costs. To address these problems we introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing covariances. Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead of computing point estimates. Changes in market conditions are captured by assuming a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally computationally efficient and scalable inference is performed using particle filters. Experiments with financial data show excellent performance of the proposed method with respect to current standard models.},

A goal of our work is to parse these complex epileptic events into distinct dynamic regimes. A challenge posed by the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data we study is the fact that the number and placement of electrodes can vary between patients. We develop a Bayesian nonparametric Markov switching process that allows for (i) shared dynamic regimes between a variable numbers of channels, (ii) asynchronous regimeswitching, and (iii) an unknown dictionary of dynamic regimes. We encode a sparse and changing set of dependencies between the channels using a Markov-switching Gaussian graphical model for the innovations process driving the channel dynamics. We demonstrate the importance of this model in parsing and out-of-sample predictions of iEEG data. We show that our model produces intuitive state assignments that can help automate clinical analysis of seizures and enable the comparison of sub-clinical bursts and full clinical seizures.},

In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm to sparse group feature selection, which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying group structure and performing feature selection simultaneously. The main contributions of this article are twofold: (1) statistically, we introduce a nonconvex sparse group feature selection model which can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore, consistent feature selection and parameter estimation can be achieved; (2) computationally, we propose an efficient algorithm that is applicable to large-scale problems. Numerical results suggest that the proposed nonconvex method compares favorably against its competitors on synthetic data and real-world applications, thus achieving desired goal of delivering high performance.},

Here, the CPU cost during test-time must be budgeted and accounted for. In this paper, we address the challenge of balancing the test-time cost and the classifier accuracy in a principled fashion. The test-time cost of a classifier is often dominated by the computation required for feature extraction--which can vary drastically across features. We decrease this extraction time by constructing a tree of classifiers, through which test inputs traverse along individual paths. Each path extracts different features and is optimized for a specific subpartition of the input space. By only computing features for inputs that benefit from them the most, our cost-sensitive tree of classifiers can match the high accuracies of the current state-of-the-art at a small fraction of the computational cost.},

We demonstrate that the obvious approach of subsampling produces inferior results and propose a generic approximated optimization technique that reduces the NE optimization cost to O(n log n). The technique is based on realizing that in visualization the embedding space is necessarily very low-dimensional (2D or 3D), and hence efficient approximations developed for n-body force calculations can be applied. In gradient-based NE algorithms the gradient for an individual point decomposes into forces exerted by the other points. The contributions of close-by points need to be computed individually but far-away points can be approximated by their center of mass, rapidly computable by applying a recursive decomposition of the visualization space into quadrants. The new algorithm brings a significant speed-up for medium-size data, and brings big data within reach of visualization.},

It can be expressed as a linear program, and, with appropriate preprocessing, interior-point methods can be used to find a solution for moderately large problems. Dealing with very large problems, e.g., involving data up to and beyond the terabyte regime, remains a challenge. Here, we present a randomized algorithm that runs in nearly linear time in the size of the input and that, with constant probability, computes a $(1+\epsilon)$ approximate solution to an arbitrary quantile regression problem. As a key step, our algorithm computes a low-distortion subspace-preserving embedding with respect to the loss function of quantile regression. Our empirical evaluation illustrates that our algorithm is competitive with the best previous work on small to medium-sized problems, and that in addition it can be implemented in MapReduce-like environments and applied to terabyte-sized problems.},

However, there are two main shortcomings of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms. First, they have to deal with non-convex optimization problems, leading to clustering results that are sensitive to the initialization. Second, none of these algorithms is equipped with theoretical guarantee regarding the clustering performance. We address these limitations by developing a framework for semisupervised clustering based on input pattern assisted matrix completion. The key idea is to cast clustering into a matrix completion problem, and solve it efficiently by exploiting the correlation between input patterns and cluster assignments. Our analysis shows that under appropriate conditions, only O(log n) pairwise constraints are needed to accurately recover the true cluster partition. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it to the state-of-the-art semisupervised clustering algorithms on several benchmark datasets.},

While a sufficient condition on the form of the regularizer guaranteeing the representer theorem has been known since the initial development of kernel methods, necessary conditions have only been investigated recently. In this paper we completely characterize the necessary and sufficient conditions on the regularizer that ensure the representer theorem holds. The results are surprisingly simple yet broaden the conditions where the representer theorem is known to hold. Extension to the matrix domain is also addressed.},

We propose a new method called proportion-SVM, or $\propto$SVM, which explicitly models the latent unknown instance labels together with the known group label proportions in a large-margin framework. Unlike the existing works, our approach avoids making restrictive assumptions about the data. The $\propto$SVM model leads to a non-convex integer programming problem. In order to solve it efficiently, we propose two algorithms: one based on simple alternating optimization and the other based on a convex relaxation. Extensive experiments on standard datasets show that $\propto$SVM outperforms the state-of-the-art, especially for larger group sizes.},

 abstract = {View-invariant object representations created from feature pooling networks have been widely adopted in state-of-the-art visual recognition systems. Recently, the research community seeks to improve these view-invariant representations further by additional invariance and receptive field learning, or by taking on the challenge of processing massive amounts of learning data. In this paper we consider an alternate strategy of directly modeling complex invariances of object features. While this may sound like a naive and inferior approach, our experiments show that this approach can achieve competitive and state-of-the-art accuracy on visual recognition data sets such as CIFAR-10 and STL-10. We present an highly applicable dictionary learning algorithm on complex invariances that can be used in most feature pooling network settings. It also has the merits of simplicity and requires no additional tuning. We also discuss the implication of our experiment results concerning recent observations on the usefulness of pre-trained features, and the role of direct invariance modeling in invariance learning.},

We formulate fairness as an optimization problem of finding a good representation of the data with two competing goals: to encode the data as well as possible, while simultaneously obfuscating any information about membership in the protected group. We show positive results of our algorithm relative to other known techniques, on three datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate several advantages to our approach. First, our intermediate representation can be used for other classification tasks (i.e., transfer learning is possible); secondly, we take a step toward learning a distance metric which can find important dimensions of the data for classification.},

This is reasonable in batch settings, but it is not reasonable when data are revealed over time, as is the case with streaming / online algorithms. To address this lacuna, we extend LDA by drawing topics from a Dirichlet process whose base distribution is a distribution over all strings rather than from a finite Dirichlet. We develop inference using online variational inference and because we only can consider a finite number of words for each truncated topic propose heuristics to dynamically organize, expand, and contract the set of words we consider in our vocabulary truncation. We show our model can successfully incorporate new words as it encounters new terms and that it performs better than online LDA in evaluations of topic quality and classification performance.},

 abstract = {Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) as a well-known supervised dimensionality reduction method has been widely applied in many fields. However, the lack of sparsity in the LDA solution makes interpretation of the results challenging. In this paper, we propose a new model for sparse uncorrelated LDA (ULDA). Our model is based on the characterization of all solutions of the generalized ULDA. We incorporate sparsity into the ULDA transformation by seeking the solution with minimum ℓ <sub xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">1</sub> -norm from all minimum dimension solutions of the generalized ULDA.

To solve this problem, we devise two algorithms: 1) by applying the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers and 2) by applying the accelerated linearized Bregman method. Simulation studies and high-dimensional real data examples demonstrate that our algorithms not only compute extremely sparse solutions but also perform well in classification.},

However, there is limited research work on investigating which of the two learning scenarios performs better. This paper proposes a novel framework - Multiple Instance LEArning with Global Embedding (MILEAGE), in which the global feature vectors for traditional learning methods are integrated into the MIL setting. Within the proposed framework, a large margin method is formulated to adaptively tune the weights on the two different kinds of feature representations (i.e., global and multiple instance) for each example and trains the classifier simultaneously. An extensive set of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.},

 abstract = {Covariate shift is an unconventional learning scenario in which training and testing data have different distributions. A general principle to solve the problem is to make the training data distribution similar to that of the test domain, such that classifiers computed on the former generalize well to the latter. Current approaches typically target on sample distributions in the input space, however, for kernel-based learning methods, the algorithm performance depends directly on the geometry of the kernel-induced feature space. Motivated by this, we propose to match data distributions in the Hilbert space, which, given a pre-defined empirical kernel map, can be formulated as aligning kernel matrices across domains. In particular, to evaluate similarity of kernel matrices defined on arbitrarily different samples, the novel concept of surrogate kernel is introduced based on the Mercer's theorem. Our approach caters the model adaptation specifically to kernel-based learning mechanism, and demonstrates promising results on several real-world applications.},

Although many online learning algorithms have been proposed to learn a sparse kernel classifier, most of them fail to bound the number of support vectors used by the final solution which is the average of the intermediate kernel classifiers generated by online algorithms. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to measure the difficulty in correctly classifying a training example by the derivative of a smooth loss function, and give a more chance to a difficult example to be a support vector than an easy one via a sampling scheme. Our analysis shows that when the loss function is smooth, the proposed algorithm yields similar performance guarantee as the standard online learning algorithm but with a near optimal number of support vectors (up to a poly(ln T) factor). Our empirical study shows promising performance of the proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms for online sparse kernel learning.},

 abstract = {Let X denote the feature and Y the target. We consider domain adaptation under three possible scenarios: (1) the marginal PY changes, while the conditional PX/Y stays the same (target shift), (2) the marginal PY is fixed, while the conditional PX/Y changes with certain constraints (conditional shift), and (3) the marginal PY changes, and the conditional PX/Y changes with constraints (generalized target shift). Using background knowledge, causal interpretations allow us to determine the correct situation for a problem at hand. We exploit importance reweighting or sample transformation to find the learning machine that works well on test data, and propose to estimate the weights or transformations by reweighting or transforming training data to reproduce the covariate distribution on the test domain. Thanks to kernel embedding of conditional as well as marginal distributions, the proposed approaches avoid distribution estimation, and are applicable for high-dimensional problems. Numerical evaluations on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.},

When facing complex domains, such as positive semi-definite cones, the projection operation can be expensive, leading to a high computational cost per iteration. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm that aims to reduce the number of projections for stochastic optimization. The proposed algorithm combines the strength of several recent developments in stochastic optimization, including mini-batch, extra-gradient, and epoch gradient descent, in order to effectively explore the smoothness and strong convexity. We show, both in expectation and with a high probability, that when the objective function is both smooth and strongly convex, the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal $O(1/T)$ rate of convergence with only $O(\log T)$ projections. Our empirical study verifies the theoretical result.},

 abstract = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying, out of a pool of possible designs, those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. This means that usually there is not one optimal design but an entire set of Pareto-optimal ones with optimal tradeoffs in the objectives. In many applications, evaluating one design is expensive; thus, an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is unfeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the Pareto Active Learning (PAL) algorithm which intelligently samples the design space to predict the Pareto-optimal set. Key features of PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as samples from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accomodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we show an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets. The results show PAL's effectiveness; in particular it improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in many cases about 33% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

We present a hierarchical approach which exploits information sharing among different classification tasks, in multitask and multi-class settings. It engages a top-down iterative method, which begins by posing an optimization problem with an incentive for large scale sharing among all classes. This incentive to share is gradually decreased, until there is no sharing and all tasks are considered separately. The method therefore exploits different levels of sharing within a given group of related tasks, without having to make hard decisions about the grouping of tasks. In order to deal with large scale problems, with many tasks and many classes, we extend our batch approach to an online setting and provide regret analysis of the algorithm. We tested our approach extensively on synthetic and real datasets, showing significant improvement over baseline and state-of-the-art methods.},
