 abstract = {Deep learning excels at learning task information from large amounts of data, but struggles with learning from declarative high-level knowledge that can be more succinctly expressed directly. In this work, we introduce PYLON, a neuro-symbolic training framework that builds on PyTorch to augment procedurally trained models with declaratively specified knowledge. PYLON lets users programmatically specify constraints as Python functions and compiles them into a differentiable loss, thus training predictive models that fit the data whilst satisfying the specified constraints. PYLON includes both exact as well as approximate compilers to efficiently compute the loss, employing fuzzy logic, sampling methods, and circuits, ensuring scalability even to complex models and constraints. Crucially, a guiding principle in designing PYLON is the ease with which any existing deep learning codebase can be extended to learn from constraints in a few lines code: a function that expresses the constraint, and a single line to compile it into a loss. Our demo comprises of models in NLP, computer vision, logical games, and knowledge graphs that can be interactively trained using constraints as supervision.},

 abstract = {Progress in machine learning is typically measured by training and testing a model on the same distribution of data, i.e., the same domain. This over-estimates future accuracy on out-of-distribution data. The Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) 2021 competition tests models' ability to adapt to novel test distributions and handle distributional shift. We set up unsupervised domain adaptation challenges for image classifiers and will evaluate adaptation to novel viewpoints, backgrounds, modalities and degradation in quality. Our challenge draws on large-scale publicly available datasets but constructs the evaluation across domains, rather that the traditional in-domain bench-marking. Furthermore, we focus on the difficult "universal" setting where, in addition to input distribution drift, methods may encounter missing and/or novel classes in the target dataset. Performance will be measured using a rigorous protocol, comparing to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods with the help of established metrics. We believe that the competition will encourage further improvement in machine learning methods' ability to handle realistic data in many deployment scenarios.},

 abstract = {Dexterous manipulation remains an open problem in robotics. To coordinate efforts of the research community towards tackling this problem, we propose a shared benchmark. We designed and built robotic platforms that are hosted at MPI for Intelligent Systems and can be accessed remotely. Each platform consists of three robotic fingers that are capable of dexterous object manipulation. Users are able to control the platforms remotely by submitting code that is executed automatically, akin to a computational cluster. Using this setup, i) we host robotics competitions, where teams from anywhere in the world access our platforms to tackle challenging tasks ii) we publish the datasets collected during these competitions (consisting of hundreds of robot hours), and iii) we give researchers access to these platforms for their own projects.},

 abstract = {The infrastructure necessary for training state-of-the-art models is becoming overly expensive, which makes training such models affordable only to large corporations and institutions. Recent work proposes several methods for training such models collaboratively, i.e., by pooling together hardware from many independent parties and training a shared model over the Internet. In this demonstration, we collaboratively trained a text-to-image transformer similar to OpenAI DALL-E. We invited the viewers to join the ongoing training run, showing them instructions on how to contribute using the available hardware. We explained how to address the engineering challenges associated with such a training run (slow communication, limited memory, uneven performance between devices, and security concerns) and discussed how the viewers can set up collaborative training runs themselves. Finally, we show that the resulting model generates images of reasonable quality on a number of prompts.},

 abstract = {In real-world applications, such as loan approvals or claims management, machine learn-ing (ML) models need to be updated or retrained to adhere to new rules and regulations.But how can a new model be built and new decision boundaries be formed without having new training data available? We present the AI Model Explorer and Editor tool (AIMEE) for model exploration and model editing using human understandable rules. It addresses the problem of changing decision boundaries by leveraging user-specified feedback rules that are used to pre-process training data such that a retrained model will reflect user changes.The pre-processing step uses synthetic oversampling and relabeling and assumes black-box access to the algorithm that retrains the model. AIMEE provides interactive methods to edit rule sets, visualize changes to decision boundaries, and generate interpretable comparisons of model changes so that users see their feedback reflected in the updated model. The demo shows an end-to-end solution that supports the full update lifecycle of an ML model.},

 abstract = {In this report, we describe the Open Catalyst Challenge held at NeurIPS 2021, focusing on using machine learning (ML) to accelerate the search for low-cost catalysts that can drive reactions converting renewable energy to storable forms. Specifically, the challenge required participants to develop ML approaches for relaxed energy prediction, i.e. given atomic positions for an adsorbate-catalyst system, the goal was to predict the energy of the systemâs relaxed or lowest energy state. To perform well on this task, ML approaches need to approximate the quantum mechanical computations in Density Functional Theory (DFT). By modeling these accurately, the catalystâs impact on the overall rate of a chemical reaction may be estimated; a key factor in filtering potential electrocatalyst materials. The challenge encouraged community-wide progress on this task and the winning approach improved direct relaxed energy prediction by Â 15% relative over the previous state-of-the-art.},

 abstract = {As machine learning has become increasingly ubiquitous, there has been a growing need to assess the trustworthiness of learned models. One important aspect to model trust is conceptual soundness, i.e., the extent to which a model uses features that are appropriate for its intended task. We present <em>TruLens</em>, a new cross-platform framework for explaining deep network behavior. In our demonstration, we provide an interactive application built on TruLens that we use to explore the conceptual soundness of various pre-trained models. We take the unique perspective that robustness to small-norm adversarial examples is a necessary condition for conceptual soundness; we demonstrate this by comparing explanations on models trained with and without a robust objective. Our demonstration will focus on our end-to-end application, which will be made accessible for the audience to interact with; but we will also provide details on its open-source components, including the TruLens library and the code used to train robust networks.},

We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over 10^12 GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input.},

Meta-learning methods can address this problem by transferring knowledge from related tasks, thus reducing the amount of data and computing resources needed to learn new tasks. We organize the MetaDL competition series, which provide opportunities for research groups all over the world to create and experimentally assess new meta-(deep)learning solutions for real problems. In this paper, authored collaboratively between the competition organizers and the top-ranked participants, we describe the design of the competition, the datasets, the best experimental results, as well as the top-ranked methods in the NeurIPS 2021 challenge, which attracted 15 active teams who made it to the final phase (by outperforming the baseline), making over 100 code submissions during the feedback phase. The solutions of the top participants have been open-sourced. The lessons learned include that learning good representations is essential for effective transfer learning.},

TripleBlind provides a set of automated, high-level APIs that enable (1) extracting knowledge from remote data without moving it outside the ownerâs infrastructure, (2) training AI models from decentralized data, and (3) consuming trained models for secure inference-as-a-service; all without compromising the privacy of either the model/query or the data. In this short paper, we shed light on the underlying training and inference methods, the design and implementation of our framework, and showcase the actual code necessary to run a secure, remote inference using our secure multi-party computation API.

It allows us to track the evolution of word senses, as well as to understand the difference between the languages used by distinct communities. LSC detection is often done by applying a distance measure over vectors of two aligned word embedding matrices. In this paper, we present SenSE, an interactive semantic shift exploration toolkit that provides visualization and explanation of lexical semantic change for an input pair of text sources. Our system focuses on showing how the different alignment strategies may affect the output of an LSC model as well as on explaining semantic change based on the neighbors of a chosen target word, while also extracting examples of sentences where these semantic deviations appear. The system runs as a web application (available at \url{http://sense.mgruppi.me}), allowing the audience to interact by configuring the alignment strategies while visualizing the results in a web browser.},

 abstract = {Millions of people around the world can not access content on the Web because most of the content is not readily available in their language. Machine translation (MT) systems have the potential to change this for many languages. Current MT systems provide very accurate results for high resource language pairs, e.g., German and English. However, for many low resource languages, MT is still under active research. The key challenge is lack of datasets to build these systems. We present Lesan (https://lesan.ai/), an MT system for low resource languages. Our pipeline solves the key bottleneck to low resource MT by leveraging online and offline sources, a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for Ethiopic and an automatic alignment module. The final step in the pipeline is a sequence to sequence model that takes parallel corpus as input and gives us a translation model. Lesan{â}s translation model is based on the Transformer architecture. After constructing a base model, back translation is used to leverage monolingual corpora. Currently Lesan supports translation to and from Tigrinya, Amharic and English. We perform extensive human evaluation and show that Lesan outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as Google Translate and Microsoft Translator across all six pairs.

 abstract = {In this report, we summarize the takeaways from the first NeurIPS 2021 NetHack Challenge. Participants were tasked with developing a program or agent that can win (i.e., 'ascend' in) the popular dungeon-crawler game of NetHack by interacting with the NetHack Learning Environment (NLE), a scalable, procedurally generated, and challenging Gym environment for reinforcement learning (RL). The challenge showcased community-driven progress in AI with many diverse approaches significantly beating the previously best results on NetHack. Furthermore, it served as a direct comparison between neural (e.g., deep RL) and symbolic AI, as well as hybrid systems, demonstrating that on NetHack symbolic bots currently outperform deep RL by a large margin. Lastly, no agent got close to winning the game, illustrating NetHack's suitability as a long-term benchmark for AI research.},

Recent technological advances in single-cell genomics have enabled the measurement of multiple facets of cellular state, producing datasets with millions of single-cell observations. While these data hold great promise for understanding molecular mechanisms in health and disease, analysis challenges arising from sparsity, technical and biological variability, and high dimensionality of the data hinder the derivation of such mechanistic insights. To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we present the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges associated with running the competition.},

Prospective explanations are aimed at showing how models function by highlighting likely changes in model outcomes under changes in input. This in contrast to most post-hoc explanability methods, that aim to provide a justification for a decision retrospectively. To do so, we employ a surrogate Bayesian network model and learn dependencies through a structure learning task. Our system is designed to provide fast estimates of changes in outcomes for any arbitrary exploratory query from users. Such queries are typical partial, i.e. involve only a selected number of features, the outcomes labels are shown therefore as likelihoods. Repeated queries can indicate which aspects of the feature space are more likely to influence the target variable. We demonstrate the system from a real-world application from the humanitarian sector and show the value of bayesian network surrogates.},

In this demo, we utilize interactive visualization to increase the interpretability of a number of state-of-the-art techniques that are designed to identify, mitigate, and attenuate these biases in word representations, in particular, from a geometric perspective. We provide an open source web-based visualization tool and offer hands-on experience in exploring the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques change the underlying geometry, we decompose each technique into modular and interpretable sequences of primitive operations, and study their effect on the word vectors using dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration. This demo is primarily designed to aid natural language processing (NLP) practitioners and researchers working with fairness and ethics of machine learning systems. It can also be used to educate NLP novices in understanding the existence of and then mitigating biases in word embeddings. },

Rather than mandating the use of LfHF techniques, we described four tasks in natural language to be accomplished in the video game Minecraft, and allowed participants to use any approach they wanted to build agents that could accomplish the tasks. Teams developed a diverse range of LfHF algorithms across a variety of possible human feedback types. The three winning teams implemented significantly different approaches while achieving similar performance. Interestingly, their approaches performed well on <em>different</em> tasks, validating our choice of tasks to include in the competition. While the outcomes validated the design of our competition, we did not get as many participants and submissions as our sister competition, MineRL Diamond.

However, deploying recent advances in embedding based techniques for search, recommendation and ranking at scale require ANNS indices at billion, trillion or larger scale. Barring a few recent papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale vis-Ã -vis their hardware cost. This competition\footnote{\url{https://big-ann-benchmarks.com}} compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost, accuracy and performance. We set up an open source evaluation framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/harsha-simhadri/big-ann-benchmarks/}}% and leaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale indices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size. It uses FAISSÂ \citep{Faiss17} as the baseline. The standard hardware track T2 additional allows inexpensive SSDs in addition to the limited DRAM and uses DiskANNÂ \citep{DiskANN19} as the baseline. The specialized hardware track T3 allows any hardware configuration, and again uses FAISS as the baseline. We compiled six diverse billion-scale datasets, four newly released for this competition, that span a variety of modalities, data types, dimensions, deep learning models, distance functions and sources. The outcome of the competition was ranked leaderboards of algorithms in each track based on recall at a query throughput threshold. Additionally, for track T3, separate leaderboards were created based on recall as well as cost-normalized and power-normalized query throughput.},

 abstract = {Transfer learning and meta-learning offer some of the most promising avenues to unlock the scalability of healthcare and consumer technologies driven by biosignal data. This is because current methods cannot generalise well across human subjects' data and handle learning from different heterogeneously collected data sets, thus limiting the scale of training data. On the other side, developments in transfer learning would benefit significantly from a real-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we pick electroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for what makes biosignal machine learning hard. We design two transfer learning challenges around diagnostics and Brain-Computer-Interfacing (BCI), that have to be solved in the face of low signal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the data recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks recorded in the dataset. Task 1 is centred on the field of medical diagnostics, addressing automatic sleep stage annotation across subjects. Task 2 is centred on Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), addressing motor imagery decoding across both subjects and data sets. The BEETL competition with its over 30 competing teams and its 3 winning entries brought attention to the potential of deep transfer learning and combinations of set theory and conventional machine learning techniques to overcome the challenges. The results set a new state-of-the-art for the real-world BEETL benchmark.},

 abstract = {Questions in causality, control, and reinforcement learning go beyond the classical machine learning task of prediction under i.i.d. observations. Instead, these fields consider the problem of learning how to actively perturb a system to achieve a certain effect on a response variable. Arguably, they have complementary views on the problem: In control, one usually aims to first identify the system by excitation strategies to then apply model-based design techniques to control the system. In (non-model-based) reinforcement learning, one directly optimizes a reward. In causality, one focus is on identifiability of causal structure. We believe that combining the different views might create synergies and this competition is meant as a first step toward such synergies. The participants had access to observational and (offline) interventional data generated by dynamical systems. Track CHEM considers an open-loop problem in which a single impulse at the beginning of the dynamics can be set, while Track ROBO considers a closed-loop problem in which control variables can be set at each time step. The goal in both tracks is to infer controls that drive the system to a desired state. Code is open-sourced ( https://github.com/LearningByDoingCompetition/learningbydoing-comp ) to reproduce the winning solutions of the competition and to facilitate trying out new methods on the competition tasks.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v176-wilson22a,
 abstract = {Uncertainty representation is crucial to the safe and reliable deployment of deep learning. Bayesian methods provide a natural mechanism to represent epistemic uncertainty, leading to improved generalization and calibrated predictive distributions. Understanding the fidelity of approximate inference has extraordinary value beyond the standard approach of measuring generalization on a particular task: if approximate inference is working correctly, then we can expect more reliable and accurate deployment across any number of real-world settings. In this competition, we evaluate the fidelity of approximate Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning, using as a reference Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples obtained by parallelizing computations over hundreds of tensor processing unit (TPU) devices. We consider a variety of tasks, including image recognition, regression, covariate shift, and medical applications. All data are publicly available, and we release several baselines, including stochastic MCMC, variational methods, and deep ensembles. The competition resulted in hundreds of submissions across many teams. The winning entries all involved novel multi-modal posterior approximations, highlighting the relative importance of representing multiple modes, and suggesting that we should not consider deep ensembles a {â}non-Bayesian{â} alternative to standard unimodal approximations. In the future, the competition will provide a foundation for innovation and continued benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning. The HMC samples will remain available through the competition website.},

 abstract = {We present two weakly-supervised deep learning frameworks for person indoor localization through Wi-Fi signal. These two frameworks, namely OT-Isomap and WiCluster, in contrast with prior works, require only room/zone level labels that is easier to acquire, compared to hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. The OT-Isomap is a modality-agnostic model and formulates the localization problem in the context of parametric manifold learning and optimal transportation. This framework allows jointly learning a low-dimensional embedding as well as correspondences with a topological map. The WiCluster method is based on self-supervised deep clustering and metric learning models. Inspired by the deep cluster method, the Wi-Fi signals are spatially charted and represented in lower-dimensional space while a triplet margin-loss constrains an isometric representation of data on its 2D/3D intrinsic space. We demonstrate the meter-level accuracy of these two methods on both real-world Wi-Fi and camera-based indoor localization.},
