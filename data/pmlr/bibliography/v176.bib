This paper presents a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the top submissions. It appears that the most difficult image transformations involve either severe image crops or overlaying onto unrelated images, combined with local pixel perturbations. The key algorithmic elements in the winning submissions are: training on strong augmentations, self-supervised learning, score normalization, explicit overlay detection, and global descriptor matching followed by pairwise image comparison.}

  abstract = 	 {Reinforcement learning competitions advance the field by providing appropriate scope and support to develop solutions toward a specific problem. To promote the development of more broadly applicable methods, organizers need to enforce the use of general techniques, the use of sample-efficient methods, and the reproducibility of the results. While beneficial for the research community, these restrictions come at a costâincreased difficulty. If the barrier for entry is too high, many potential participants are demoralized. With this in mind, we hosted the third edition of the MineRL ObtainDiamond competition, MineRL Diamond 2021, with a separate track in which we permitted any solution to promote the participation of newcomers. With this track and more extensive tutorials and support, we saw an increased number of submissions. The participants of this easier track were able to obtain a diamond, and the participants of the harder track progressed the generalizable solutions in the same task.}

Specifically, the challenge required participants to develop ML approaches for relaxed energy prediction, i.e. given atomic positions for an adsorbate-catalyst system, the goal was to predict the energy of the systemâs relaxed or lowest energy state. To perform well on this task, ML approaches need to approximate the quantum mechanical computations in Density Functional Theory (DFT). By modeling these accurately, the catalystâs impact on the overall rate of a chemical reaction may be estimated; a key factor in filtering potential electrocatalyst materials. The challenge encouraged community-wide progress on this task and the winning approach improved direct relaxed energy prediction by Â 15% relative over the previous state-of-the-art.}

The challenge showcased community-driven progress in AI with many diverse approaches significantly beating the previously best results on NetHack. Furthermore, it served as a direct comparison between neural (e.g., deep RL) and symbolic AI, as well as hybrid systems, demonstrating that on NetHack symbolic bots currently outperform deep RL by a large margin. Lastly, no agent got close to winning the game, illustrating NetHackâs suitability as a long-term benchmark for AI research.}

The Visual Domain Adaptation (VisDA) 2021 competition tests modelsâ ability to adapt to novel test distributions and handle distributional shift. We set up unsupervised domain adaptation challenges for image classifiers and evaluate adaptation to novel viewpoints, backgrounds, styles and degradation in quality. Our challenge draws on large-scale publicly available datasets but constructs the evaluation across domains, rather than the traditional in-domain benchmarking. Furthermore, we focus on the difficult âuniversal" setting where, in addition to input distribution drift, methods encounter missing and/or novel classes in the test set. In this paper, we describe the datasets and evaluation metrics and highlight similarities across top-performing methods that might point to promising future directions in universal domain adaptation research. We hope that the competition will encourage further improvement in machine learning methodsâ ability to handle realistic data in many deployment scenarios. http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2021/.}

We organize the MetaDL competition series, which provide opportunities for research groups all over the world to create and experimentally assess new meta-(deep)learning solutions for real problems. In this paper, authored collaboratively between the competition organizers and the top-ranked participants, we describe the design of the competition, the datasets, the best experimental results, as well as the top-ranked methods in the NeurIPS 2021 challenge, which attracted 15 active teams who made it to the final phase (by outperforming the baseline), making over 100 code submissions during the feedback phase.

We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over $10^{12}$ GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input. }

  abstract = 	 {Uncertainty representation is crucial to the safe and reliable deployment of deep learning. Bayesian methods provide a natural mechanism to represent epistemic uncertainty, leading to improved generalization and calibrated predictive distributions. Understanding the fidelity of approximate inference has extraordinary value beyond the standard approach of measuring generalization on a particular task: if approximate inference is working correctly, then we can expect more reliable and accurate deployment across any number of real-world settings. In this competition, we evaluate the fidelity of approximate Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning, using as a reference Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samples obtained by parallelizing computations over hundreds of tensor processing unit (TPU) devices. We consider a variety of tasks, including image recognition, regression, covariate shift, and medical applications. All data are publicly available, and we release several baselines, including stochastic MCMC, variational methods, and deep ensembles. The competition resulted in hundreds of submissions across many teams. The winning entries all involved novel multi-modal posterior approximations, highlighting the relative importance of representing multiple modes, and suggesting that we should not consider deep ensembles a {â}non-Bayesian{â} alternative to standard unimodal approximations. In the future, the competition will provide a foundation for innovation and continued benchmarking of approximate Bayesian inference procedures in deep learning. The HMC samples will remain available through the competition website.}

To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task.

  abstract = 	 {Despite the broad range of algorithms for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search, most empirical evaluations of algorithms have focused on smaller datasets, typically of 1 million pointsÂ \citep{Benchmark}. However, deploying recent advances in embedding based techniques for search, recommendation and ranking at scale require ANNS indices at billion, trillion or larger scale. Barring a few recent papers, there is limited consensus on which algorithms are effective at this scale vis-Ã -vis their hardware cost. This competition\footnote{\url{https://big-ann-benchmarks.com}} compares ANNS algorithms at billion-scale by hardware cost, accuracy and performance. We set up an open source evaluation framework\footnote{\url{https://github.com/harsha-simhadri/big-ann-benchmarks/}}% and leaderboards for both standardized and specialized hardware. The competition involves three tracks. The standard hardware track T1 evaluates algorithms on an Azure VM with limited DRAM, often the bottleneck in serving billion-scale indices, where the embedding data can be hundreds of GigaBytes in size. It uses FAISSÂ \citep{Faiss17} as the baseline. The standard hardware track T2 additional allows inexpensive SSDs in addition to the limited DRAM and uses DiskANNÂ \citep{DiskANN19} as the baseline. The specialized hardware track T3 allows any hardware configuration, and again uses FAISS as the baseline. We compiled six diverse billion-scale datasets, four newly released for this competition, that span a variety of modalities, data types, dimensions, deep learning models, distance functions and sources. The outcome of the competition was ranked leaderboards of algorithms in each track based on recall at a query throughput threshold. Additionally, for track T3, separate leaderboards were created based on recall as well as cost-normalized and power-normalized query throughput.}

We designed and built robotic platforms that are hosted at the MPI-IS and can be accessed remotely. Each platform consists of three robotic fingers that are capable of dexterous object manipulation. Users are able to control the platforms remotely by submitting code that is executed automatically, akin to a computational cluster. Using this setup, i) we host robotics competitions, where teams from anywhere in the world access our platforms to tackle challenging tasks ii) we publish the datasets collected during these competitions (consisting of hundreds of robot hours), and iii) we give researchers access to these platforms for their own projects.}

  abstract = 	 {Transfer learning and meta-learning offer some of the most promising avenues to unlock the scalability of healthcare and consumer technologies driven by biosignal data. This is because regular machine learning methods cannot generalise well across human subjects and handle learning from different, heterogeneously collected data sets, thus limiting the scale of training data available. On the other hand, the many developments in transfer- and meta-learning fields would benefit significantly from a real-world benchmark with immediate practical application. Therefore, we pick electroencephalography (EEG) as an exemplar for all the things that make biosignal data analysis a hard problem. We design two transfer learning challenges around a. clinical diagnostics and b. neurotechnology. These two challenges are designed to probe algorithmic performance with all the challenges of biosignal data, such as low signal-to-noise ratios, major variability among subjects, differences in the data recording sessions and techniques, and even between the specific BCI tasks recorded in the dataset. Task 1 is centred on the field of medical diagnostics, addressing automatic sleep stage annotation across subjects. Task 2 is centred on Brain-Computer Interfacing (BCI), addressing motor imagery decoding across both subjects and data sets. The successful 2021 BEETL competition with its over 30 competing teams and its 3 winning entries brought attention to the potential of deep transfer learning and combinations of set theory and conventional machine learning techniques to overcome the challenges. The results set a new state-of-the-art for the real-world BEETL benchmarks.}

Until recently, its methods have focused on solving problem instances in isolation, ignoring that they often stem from related data distributions in practice. However, recent years have seen a surge of interest in using machine learning as a new approach for solving combinatorial problems, either directly as solvers or by enhancing exact solvers. Based on this context, the ML4CO aims at improving state-of-the-art combinatorial optimization solvers by replacing key heuristic components. The competition featured three challenging tasks: finding the best feasible solution, producing the tightest optimality certificate, and giving an appropriate solver configuration. Three realistic datasets were considered: balanced item placement, workload apportionment, and maritime inventory routing. This last dataset was kept anonymous for the contestants.}

  abstract = 	 {Questions in causality, control, and reinforcement learning go beyond the classical machine learning task of prediction under i.i.d. observations. Instead, these fields consider the problem of learning how to actively perturb a system to achieve a certain effect on a response variable. Arguably, they have complementary views on the problem: In control, one usually aims to first identify the system by excitation strategies to then apply model-based design techniques to control the system. In (non-model-based) reinforcement learning, one directly optimizes a reward. In causality, one focus is on identifiability of causal structure. We believe that combining the different views might create synergies and this competition is meant as a first step toward such synergies. The participants had access to observational and (offline) interventional data generated by dynamical systems. Track CHEM considers an open-loop problem in which a single impulse at the beginning of the dynamics can be set, while Track ROBO considers a closed-loop problem in which control variables can be set at each time step. The goal in both tracks is to infer controls that drive the system to a desired state. Code is open-sourced ( https://github.com/LearningByDoingCompetition/learningbydoing-comp ) to reproduce the winning solutions of the competition and to facilitate trying out new methods on the competition tasks.}

The goal of the competition was to promote research towards agents that use learning from human feedback (LfHF) techniques to solve open-world tasks. Rather than mandating the use of LfHF techniques, we described four tasks in natural language to be accomplished in the video game Minecraft, and allowed participants to use any approach they wanted to build agents that could accomplish the tasks. Teams developed a diverse range of LfHF algorithms across a variety of possible human feedback types. The three winning teams implemented significantly different approaches while achieving similar performance. Interestingly, their approaches performed well on <em>different</em> tasks, validating our choice of tasks to include in the competition. While the outcomes validated the design of our competition, we did not get as many participants and submissions as our sister competition, MineRL Diamond. We speculate about the causes of this problem and suggest improvements for future iterations of the competition.}

Prospective explanations are aimed at showing how models function by highlighting likely changes in model outcomes under changes in input. This in contrast to most post-hoc explanability methods, that aim to provide a justification for a decision retrospectively. To do so, we employ a surrogate Bayesian network model and learn dependencies through a structure learning task. Our system is designed to provide fast estimates of changes in outcomes for any arbitrary exploratory query from users. Such queries are typical partial, i.e. involve only a selected number of features, the outcomes labels are shown therefore as likelihoods. Repeated queries can indicate which aspects of the feature space are more likely to influence the target variable. We demonstrate the system from a real-world application from the humanitarian sector and show the value of bayesian network surrogates.}

Our system focuses on showing how the different alignment strategies may affect the output of an LSC model as well as on explaining semantic change based on the neighbors of a chosen target word, while also extracting examples of sentences where these semantic deviations appear.

We present the AI Model Explorer and Editor tool (AIMEE) for model exploration and model editing using human understandable rules. It addresses the problem of changing decision boundaries by leveraging user-specified feedback rules that are used to pre-process training data such that a retrained model will reflect user changes.The pre-processing step uses synthetic oversampling and relabeling and assumes black-box access to the algorithm that retrains the model. AIMEE provides interactive methods to edit rule sets, visualize changes to decision boundaries, and generate interpretable comparisons of model changes so that users see their feedback reflected in the updated model. The demo shows an end-to-end solution that supports the full update lifecycle of an ML model.}

However, for many low resource languages, MT is still under active research. The key challenge is lack of datasets to build these systems. We present Lesan (https://lesan.ai/), an MT system for low resource languages. Our pipeline solves the key bottleneck to low resource MT by leveraging online and offline sources, a custom Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for Ethiopic and an automatic alignment module. The final step in the pipeline is a sequence to sequence model that takes parallel corpus as input and gives us a translation model. Lesan{â}s translation model is based on the Transformer architecture. After constructing a base model, back translation is used to leverage monolingual corpora. Currently Lesan supports translation to and from Tigrinya, Amharic and English. We perform extensive human evaluation and show that Lesan outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as Google Translate and Microsoft Translator across all six pairs. Lesan is freely available and has served more than 10 million translations so far. At the moment, there are only 217 Tigrinya and 15,009 Amharic Wikipedia articles.

In our demonstration, we provide an interactive application built on TruLens that we use to explore the conceptual soundness of various pre-trained models.

  abstract = 	 {Deep learning excels at learning low-level task information from large amounts of data, but struggles with learning high-level domain knowledge, which can often be directly and succinctly expressed. In this work, we introduce Pylon, a neuro-symbolic training framework that builds on PyTorch to augment procedurally trained neural networks with declaratively specified knowledge. Pylon allows users to programmatically specify <em>constraints<\em> as PyTorch functions, and compiles them into a differentiable loss, thus training predictive models that fit the data <em>whilst<\em> satisfying the specified constraints. Pylon includes both exact as well as approximate compilers to efficiently compute the loss, employing fuzzy logic, sampling methods, and circuits, ensuring scalability even to complex models and constraints. A guiding principle in designing Pylon has been the ease with which any existing deep learning codebase can be extended to learn from constraints using only a few lines: a function expressing the constraint and a single line of code to compile it into a loss. We include case studies from natural language processing, computer vision, logical games, and knowledge graphs, that can be interactively trained, and highlights Pylon{â}s usage.}

It describes the various aspects of the ingestion, manipulation detection, and graphing algorithms employed to determineâin near real-timeâthe relationships between social media images as they emerge and spread on social media platforms. By combining these various technologies into a single processing pipeline, MEWS can identify manipulated media items as they arise and identify when these particular items begin trending on individual social media platforms or even across multiple platforms. The emergence of a novel manipulation followed by rapid diffusion of the manipulated content suggests a disinformation campaign.}

  abstract = 	 {Language representations are known to encode and propagate biases, i.e., stereotypical associations between words or groups of words that may cause representational harm. In this demo, we utilize interactive visualization to increase the interpretability of a number of state-of-the-art techniques that are designed to identify, mitigate, and attenuate these biases in word representations, in particular, from a geometric perspective. We provide an open source web-based visualization tool and offer hands-on experience in exploring the effects of these debiasing techniques on the geometry of high-dimensional word vectors. To help understand how various debiasing techniques change the underlying geometry, we decompose each technique into modular and interpretable sequences of primitive operations, and study their effect on the word vectors using dimensionality reduction and interactive visual exploration. This demo is primarily designed to aid natural language processing (NLP) practitioners and researchers working with fairness and ethics of machine learning systems. It can also be used to educate NLP novices in understanding the existence of and then mitigating biases in word embeddings. }

  abstract = 	 {The infrastructure necessary for training state-of-the-art models is becoming overly expensive, which makes training such models affordable only to large corporations and institutions. Recent work proposes several methods for training such models collaboratively, i.e., by pooling together hardware from many independent parties and training a shared model over the Internet. In this demonstration, we collaboratively trained a text-to-image transformer similar to OpenAI DALL-E. We invited the viewers to join the ongoing training run, showing them instructions on how to contribute using the available hardware. We explained how to address the engineering challenges associated with such a training run (slow communication, limited memory, uneven performance between devices, and security concerns) and discussed how the viewers can set up collaborative training runs themselves. Finally, we show that the resulting model generates images of reasonable quality on a number of prompts.}

  abstract = 	 {Centralized sharing of sensitive data for training and inference is challenging and undesired due to privacy, competition, and legal concerns. While distributed learning and secure inference have demonstrated significant privacy gains, these methods still largely ignore the design and implementation of practical, privacy-preserving tool support. To address these challenges, we present TripleBlind, an automated privacy-preserving framework for creating and consuming data-driven applications from decentralized data and algorithms. TripleBlind provides a set of automated, high-level APIs that enable (1) extracting knowledge from remote data without moving it outside the ownerâs infrastructure, (2) training AI models from decentralized data, and (3) consuming trained models for secure inference-as-a-service; all without compromising the privacy of either the model/query or the data. In this short paper, we shed light on the underlying training and inference methods, the design and implementation of our framework, and showcase the actual code necessary to run a secure, remote inference using our secure multi-party computation API. A video demo highlighting the main features of our framework is located at www.tripleblind.ai/neurips2021 }

  abstract = 	 {We present two weakly-supervised deep learning frameworks for person indoor localization through Wi-Fi signal. These two frameworks, namely OT-Isomap and WiCluster, in contrast with prior works, require only room/zone level labels that is easier to acquire, compared to hard-to-acquire centimeter accuracy position labels. The OT-Isomap is a modality-agnostic model and formulates the localization problem in the context of parametric manifold learning and optimal transportation. This framework allows jointly learning a low-dimensional embedding as well as correspondences with a topological map. The WiCluster method is based on self-supervised deep clustering and metric learning models. Inspired by the deep cluster method, the Wi-Fi signals are spatially charted and represented in lower-dimensional space while a triplet margin-loss constrains an isometric representation of data on its 2D/3D intrinsic space. We demonstrate the meter-level accuracy of these two methods on both real-world Wi-Fi and camera-based indoor localization.}
