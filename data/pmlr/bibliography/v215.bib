We utilise this second formulation to establish bounds on the appropriate likelihood function for $\epsilon$-DP data â and in turn derive limits on key quantities in both frequentist hypothesis testing and Bayesian inference. Under very mild conditions, these results are valid for arbitrary parameters, priors and data generating models. These bounds are weaker than those attainable when analysing specific data generating models or data-release mechanisms. However, they provide generally applicable limits on the ability to learn from differentially private data â even when the analystâs knowledge of the model or mechanism is limited. They also shed light on the semantic interpretation of differential privacy, a subject of contention in the current literature.}

The question of this paper is: can we use sets of desirable gambles to represent decisions where the states do depend (e.g., causally or probabilistically) on the acts? In particular, I investigate two possible routes for representing suppositional decision theories with sets of desirable gambles, concluding that while one route works only for the subclass of SDTs representable by general imaging, the other route can represent any SDT whatsoever. After giving a fairly flat-footed representation, I investigate whether itâs equivalent to a construction directly from the local (suppositional) desirability judgments; it isnât, but this latter construction represents a different aggregation rule applied to the same âcredal committee.â Finally, I extend the representation to model uncertainty about the supposition rule itself, in addition to imprecise credences.}

Moreover, we utilize our ufg depth for a comparison of machine learning algorithms based on multidimensional performance measures. Concretely, we analyze the distribution of different classifier performances over a sample of standard benchmark data sets. Our results promisingly demonstrate that our approach differs substantially from existing benchmarking approaches and, therefore, adds a new perspective to the vivid debate on the comparison of classifiers.}

In recent literature, a notion of conjunction of two conditional events as a suitable conditional random quantity, which satisfies classical probabilistic properties, has been deepened in the setting of coherence. In this framework the conjunction $(A|H) \wedge (B|K)$ of two conditional events $A|H$ and $B|K$ is defined as a five-valued object with set of possible values $\{1,0,x,y,z\}$, where $x=P(A|H), y=P(B|K)$, and $z=\mathbb{P}[(A|H) \wedge (B|K)]$. In this paper we propose a generalization of this object, denoted by $(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)$, where the values $x$ and $y$ are replaced by two arbitrary values $a,b \in [0,1]$. Then, by means of a geometrical approach, we compute the set of all coherent assessments on the family $\{A|H,B|K,(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)\}$, by also showing that in the general case the FrÃ©chet-Hoeffding bounds for the conjunction are not satisfied. We also analyze some particular cases. Finally, we study coherence in the imprecise case of an interval-valued probability assessment and we consider further aspects on $(A|H) \wedge_{a,b} (B|K)$.}

However, often a more informative type of uncertainty quantification is desired where other inference-related tasks can be performed, such as the assignment of (imprecise) probabilities to assertions of interest about (any feature of) the regression coefficients. Validity of these probabilities, in the sense that their values are well-calibrated in a frequentist sense, is fundamental to the trustworthiness of the drawn conclusions. This paper presents a nonparametric Inferential Model (IM) construction that offers provably valid probabilistic uncertainty quantification in quantile regression, even in finite sample settings. It is also shown that this IM can be used to derive finite sample confidence regions for (any feature of) the regression coefficients. As a result, regardless of the type of uncertainty quantification desired, the proposed IM offers an appealing solution to quantile regression problems.}

It can be applied to gambles, calling them desirable if a subject accepts them, but also to pizzas, calling them desirable if my friend Arthur likes to eat them. Regardless of the particular things that are considered, inference rules are imposed by means of an abstract closure operator, and models that adhere to these rules are called coherent. I consider two types of models, each of which can capture a subjectâs beliefs about which things are desirable: sets of desirable things and sets of desirable sets of things. A crucial result is that the latter type can be represented by a set of the former.}

Interestingly, there are several settings, ranging from machine learning on partial data over frequential probability theory to quantum probability theory and decision making under uncertainty, in which a priori the probabilities are only desired to be precise on a specific underlying set system. Here, (pre-)Dynkin-systems have been adopted as systems of precision, too. Under extendability conditions those pre-Dynkin-systems equipped with probabilities can be embedded into algebras of sets. Surprisingly, the extendability conditions elaborated in a strand of work in quantum physics are equivalent to coherence. Thus, we link the literature on probabilities on pre-Dynkin-systems to the literature on imprecise probability. In fact, the system of precision and imprecise probabilities live in structural duality.}

They allow to handle behaviours lying between possibilistic decision making and probabilistic decision making while keeping the good properties of both approaches namely <em>Dynamic Consistency</em>, <em>Consequentialism</em> and <em>Tree Reduction</em>. We shed light on the various utility functionals in this setting. More precisely, in this paper, we investigate the question of parameterizing the compromise between possibilistic and probabilisic models in different contexts. To this end, we outline elicitation methods.}

In this study, an imprecise Bayesian approach to delay time modelling has been developed and compared with the frequentist and precise Bayesian approach based on a virtual maintenance problem. The conditional failure rate was the unknown parameter that had to be estimated via eight samples of failure times of increasing size. The goal was to minimise two loss functions related to the downtime and cost. The frequentist and precise Bayesian methods converge towards the optimal decision as the sample size grows but are strongly sub-optimal when no or only few data are available. The imprecise Bayesian approach based on E-admissibility returns large decision intervals in the lack of data, thereby straightforwardly representing the crucial difference between knowledge and ignorance.}

In applied research, however, researchers often have access to external information in the form of (central) statistical moments such as mean or variance. To compensate for the uncertainty in the external point values, this paper uses external intervals instead to represent the information about moments. The Sargan-Hansen test from the generalized method of moments framework is used, which exploits point-valued external information about moments in the presence of a statistical model to test whether data and external information are in conflict. For the Sargan-Hansen test, a separability result is derived with respect to the model and the external information. This result leads to a simplification of the test in terms of its analytical form and the calculation of the test statistics. To allow the use of external intervals instead of point values, an imprecise version of the Sargan-Hansen test is created using the Gamma-maximin decision rule. Assuming that the variables are normally distributed, a small sample version of this imprecise Sargan-Hansen test is derived. The power and type I errors of the developed tests are analyzed and compared in a simulation study in different small sample scenarios.}

We show that each directed graphical belief function model can be represented as a compositional model, but the converse does not hold. As there are two composition operators for belief functions, there are two types of compositional models. In studying their relation to graphical models, they are closely connected. Namely, one is more specific than the other. A precise relationship between these two composition operators is described.}

A set of almost desirable gambles $\mathcal{D}$ is evaluable for what might be called generalised type 1 and type 2 error. Generalised type 1 error is roughly a matter of the extent to which $\mathcal{D}$ encodes false judgments of desirability. Generalised type 2 error is roughly a matter of the extent to which $\mathcal{D}$ fails to encode true judgments of desirability. IP scoring rules are penalty functions that average these two types of error. To demonstrate the viability of IP scoring rules, we must show that for any coherent $\mathcal{D}$ you might choose, we can construct an IP scoring rule that renders it admissible. Moreover, every other admissible model relative to that scoring rule is also coherent. This paper makes progress toward that goal. We will also compare the class of scoring rules developed here with the results by Seidenfeld, Schervish, and Kadane from 2012,which establish that there is no strictly proper, continuous real-valued scoring rule for lower and upper probability forecasts.}

Copulas serve as dependency models between variables and are used to propagate the imprecise models. The propagation steps are detailed in the simple case of the Sum of Absolute Difference cost function for didactic purposes. The method results in an imprecise matching cost curve. To reduce computation time, a sufficient condition for conserving possibility distributions after the propagation is also presented. Finally, results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations, indicating that the method produces envelopes capable of correctly estimating the matching cost.}

But Fisherâs goalâBayesian-like probabilistic uncertainty quantification without priorsâwas more ambitious than Neymanâs, and itâs not out of reach. Iâve recently shown that reliable, prior-free probabilistic uncertainty quantification must be grounded in the theory of imprecise probability, and Iâve put forward a possibility-theoretic solution that achieves it. This has been met with resistance, however, in part due to the statistical communityâs singular focus on confidence limits. Indeed, if imprecision isnât needed to answer confidence-limit-related questions, then whatâs the point? In this paper, for a class of practically useful models, I explain specifically why the fiducial argument gives valid confidence limits, i.e., itâs the âbest probabilistic approximationâ of the possibilistic solution I recently advanced. This sheds new light on what the fiducial argument is doing and on whatâs lost in terms of reliability when imprecision is ignored and the fiducial argument is pushed for more than just confidence limits.}

  abstract = 	 {In a prequential approach to algorithmic randomness, probabilities for the next outcome can be forecast âon the flyâ without the need for fully specifying a probability measure on all possible sequences of outcomes, as is the case in the more standard approach. We take the first steps in allowing for probability intervals instead of precise probabilities in this prequential approach, based on ideas from our earlier imprecise-probabilistic and martingale-theoretic account of algorithmic randomness. We define what it means for an infinite sequence $(I_1,x_1,I_2,x_2,â¦)$ of successive interval forecasts $I_k$ and subsequent binary outcomes $x_k$ to be random. We compare the resulting prequential randomness notion with the more standard one, and investigate where both randomness notions coincide, as well as where their properties correspond.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper introduces $\alpha$-DS mixtures, which are normalized capacities that can be represented (generally not in a unique way) as the $\alpha$-mixture of a belief function and its dual plausibility function. Assuming a finite state space, such capacities extend to a Choquet expectation functional that can be given a Hurwicz-like expression. In turn, $\alpha$-DS mixtures and their Choquet expectations appear to be particularly suitable to model prices in a market with frictions, where bid-ask prices are usually averaged taking $\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$. For this, we formulate a no-arbitrage one-period pricing problem in the framework of $\alpha$-DS mixtures and prove the analogues of the first and second fundamental theorems of asset pricing. Finally, we perform a calibration on market data to derive a market consistent no-arbitrage $\alpha$-DS mixture pricing rule.}

  abstract = 	 {Self-training is a simple yet effective method within semi-supervised learning. Self-trainingâs rationale is to iteratively enhance training data by adding pseudo-labeled data. Its generalization performance heavily depends on the selection of these pseudo-labeled data (PLS). In this paper, we render PLS more robust towards the involved modeling assumptions. To this end, we treat PLS as a decision problem, which allows us to introduce a generalized utility function. The idea is to select pseudo-labeled data that maximize a multi-objective utility function. We demonstrate that the latter can be constructed to account for different sources of uncertainty and explore three examples: model selection, accumulation of errors and covariate shift. In the absence of second-order information on such uncertainties, we furthermore consider the generic approach of the generalized Bayesian $\alpha$-cut updating rule for credal sets. We spotlight the application of three of our robust extensions on both simulated and three real-world data sets. In a benchmarking study, we compare these extensions to traditional PLS methods. Results suggest that robustness with regard to model choice can lead to substantial accuracy gains.}

  abstract = 	 {Dempsterâs combination rule is the centerpiece of the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory of belief functions. In practice, Dempsterâs combination rule should only be applied to combine two distinct belief functions (in the belief function literature, distinct belief functions are also called independent belief functions). So, the question arises: what constitutes distinct belief functions? We have an answer in Dempsterâs multi-valued functions semantics for distinct belief functions. The probability functions on the two spaces associated with the multi-valued functions should be independent. In practice, however, we donât always associate a multi-valued function with belief functions in a model. In this article, we discuss the notion of distinct belief functions in graphical models, both directed and undirected. The idea of distinct belief functions corresponds to no double-counting of non-idempotent knowledge semantics of conditional independence. Although we discuss the notion of distinct belief functions in the context of the DS theory, the discussion is valid more broadly to many uncertainty calculi, including probability theory, possibility theory, and Spohnâs epistemic belief theory.}

One assumption of DST is that of a closed-world, or the assumption that all propositions are known <em>a priori</em>. In this work, we explore an alternative formulation of Dempster-Shafer that allows for the dynamic inclusion of new propositions. Specifically, we expand the framework to include the complement of every set of propositions. This adjustment enables an open-world interpretation that can support unspecified and dynamic propositions as we learn about the problem space. Including complementary sets distinguishes this from previous work in DST where the open world is attributed to the empty set. We demonstrate our open world Dempster-Shafer Theory on a variety of synthetic and real datasets.}

Following Nelsonâs approach to stochastic processes, we introduce elementary processes which are defined over a finite number of time points and that serve to approximate any standard process, including processes over continuous time. We show that every standard process can be represented by an elementary process, and that the shadow of every elementary process constitutes again a standard process. We then move to demonstrate how elementary processes can be used to define imprecise Markov chains both in discrete and continuous time. To demonstrate the benefits and downsides of this approach, we show how to recover some basic results for continuous time Markov chains through analysis of a nonstandard elementary process.}

By robust, we mean that we consider imprecise models that may abstain to classify or to compare two classes when information is insufficient. This will be reflected by considering (convex) sets of probabilities. By prime implicants, we understand a subset of attributes, minimal w.r.t. inclusion, that we need to know or specify before reaching a specified conclusion (either of dominance or non-dominance between two classes). After presenting the general concepts, we derive them in the case of the well-known naive credal classifier.}
