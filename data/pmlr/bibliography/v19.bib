 abstract = {We study the average cost Linear Quadratic (LQ) control problem with unknown model parameters, also known as the adaptive control problem in the control community. We design an algorithm and prove that apart from logarithmic factors its regret up to time T is O( p T ). Unlike previous approaches that use a forced-exploration scheme, we construct a high-probability condence set around the model parameters and design an algorithm that plays optimistically with respect to this condence set. The construction of the condence set is based on the recent results from online least-squares estimation and leads to improved worst-case regret bound for the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this is the the rst time that a regret bound is derived for the LQ control problem.},

While classical model selection approaches do not consider computational aspects of performing model selection, we argue that any practical model selection procedure must not only trade o estimation and approximation error, but also the eects of the computational eort required to compute empirical minimizers for dierent function classes. We provide a framework for analyzing such problems, and we give algorithms for model selection under a computational budget. These algorithms satisfy oracle inequalities that show that the risk of the selected model is not much worse than if we had devoted all of our computational budget to the best function class.},

We give an analysis of the query complexity of this problem, under the assumption that the payo of each arm is given by a function belonging to a known, nite, but otherwise arbitrary function class. Our analysis centers on a new notion of function class complexity that we call the haystack dimension, which is used to prove the approximate optimality of a simple greedy algorithm. This algorithm is then used as a subroutine in a functional MAB algorithm, yielding provably near-optimal regret.

 abstract = {We address the online linear optimization problem when the actions of the forecaster are represented by binary vectors. Our goal is to understand the magnitude of the minimax regret for the worst possible set of actions. We study the problem under three different assumptions for the feedback: full information, and the partial information models of the so-called "semi-bandit", and "bandit" problems. We consider both $L_\infty$-, and $L_2$-type of restrictions for the losses assigned by the adversary. We formulate a general strategy using Bregman projections on top of a potential-based gradient descent, which generalizes the ones studied in the series of papers Gyorgy et al. (2007), Dani et al. (2008), Abernethy et al. (2008), Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi (2009), Helmbold and Warmuth (2009), Koolen et al. (2010), Uchiya et al. (2010), Kale et al. (2010) and Audibert and Bubeck (2010). We provide simple proofs that recover most of the previous results. We propose new upper bounds for the semi-bandit game. Moreover we derive lower bounds for all three feedback assumptions. With the only exception of the bandit game, the upper and lower bounds are tight, up to a constant factor. Finally, we answer a question asked by Koolen et al. (2010) by showing that the exponentially weighted average forecaster is suboptimal against $L_{\infty}$ adversaries.},

 abstract = {In a partial monitoring game, the learner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome, and then the learner suffers a loss and receives a feedback signal, both of which are fixed functions of the action and the outcome. The goal of the learner is to minimize his regret, which is the difference between his total cumulative loss and the total loss of the best fixed action in hindsight. Assuming that the outcomes are generated in an i.i.d. fashion from an arbitrary and unknown probability distribution, we characterize the minimax regret of any partial monitoring game with finitely many actions and outcomes. It turns out that the minimax regret of any such game is either zero, Θ( √ T ), Θ(T ), or Θ(T ). We provide a computationally efficient learning algorithm that achieves the minimax regret within logarithmic factor for any game.},

 abstract = {This work studies the problem of privacy-preserving classification - namely, learning a classifier from sensitive data while preserving the privacy of individuals in the training set. In particular, the learning algorithm is required in this problem to guarantee differential privacy, a very strong notion of privacy that has gained significant attention in recent years. A natural question to ask is: what is the sample requirement of a learning algorithm that guarantees a certain level of privacy and accuracy? We address this question in the context of learning with infinite hypothesis classes when the data is drawn from a continuous distribution. We first show that even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithm that uses a finite number of examples and guarantees differential privacy must fail to return an accurate classifier for at least some unlabeled data distributions. This result is unlike the case with either finite hypothesis classes or discrete data domains, in which distribution-free private learning is possible, as previously shown by Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008). We then consider two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference , we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement that depends (among other things) on a measure of closeness between and the unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case. The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only label-privacy - namely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled parts of the examples) be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et al. (2006); in this work, we show a lower bound.},

For the PAC setting our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: In sharp contrast to binary classification, we show that there exist multiclass hypothesis classes for which some Empirical Risk Minimizers (ERM learners) have lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learners will fail to learn them. We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this principle to prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning symmetric multiclass hypothesis classes--classes that are invariant under permutations of label names.

 abstract = {Valiant's (2007) model of evolvability models the evolutionary process of acquiring useful functionality as a restricted form of learning from random examples. Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiant's framework (2007). One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant, 2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of learning from correlations. We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses instead of 0-1 loss in Valiant's (2007) original definition. The proof of evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Valiant, 2010). An important property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance. Previously, monotone evolvability was only shown for conjunctions with quadratic loss (Feldman, 2009) or when the distribution on the domain is severely restricted (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009; Kanade et al., 2010)},

 abstract = {Multi-label learning has attracted much attention during the past few years. Many multi-label approaches have been developed, mostly working with surrogate loss functions because multi-label loss functions are usually difficult to optimize directly owing to their non-convexity and discontinuity. These approaches are effective empirically, however, little effort has been devoted to the understanding of their consistency, i.e., the convergence of the risk of learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, we present a theoretical analysis on this important issue. We first prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Then, we study the consistency of two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss. For ranking loss, our results disclose that, surprisingly, none of convex surrogate loss is consistent; we present the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate losses are proven to be consistent. We also discuss on the consistency of univariate surrogate losses. For hamming loss, we show that two multi-label learning methods, i.e., one-vs-all and pairwise comparison, which can be regarded as direct extensions from multi-class learning, are inconsistent in general cases yet consistent under the dominating setting, and similar results also hold for some recent multi-label approaches that are variations of one-vs-all. In addition, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches that address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.},

Furthermore, we show that simple adaptations of the KL-UCB algorithm are also optimal for specic classes of (possibly unbounded) rewards, including those generated from exponential families of distributions. A large-scale numerical study comparing KL-UCB with its main competitors (UCB, MOSS, UCB-Tuned, UCB-V, DMED) shows that KL-UCB is remarkably ecient and stable, including for short time horizons. KL-UCB is also the only method that always performs better than the basic UCB policy. Our regret bounds rely on deviations results of independent interest which are stated and proved in the Appendix. As a by-product, we also obtain an improved regret bound for the standard UCB algorithm.},

 abstract = {In sequential prediction with log-loss as well as density estimation with risk measured by KL divergence, one is often interested in the expected instantaneous loss, or, equivalently, the individual risk at a given xed sample size n. For Bayesian prediction and estimation methods, it is often easy to obtain bounds on the cumulative risk. Such results are based on bounding the individual sequence regret, a technique that is very well known in the COLT community. Motivated by the easiness of proofs for the cumulative risk, our open problem is to use the results on cumulative risk to prove corresponding individual-risk bounds. Background We consider sequential prediction (online learning) with log-loss (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006). In each iteration n = 1; 2;:::, after observing a sequence of past outcomes x n = x1;x2;:::;xn 2 X n , a prediction strategy assigns a probability distribution on X , denoted ^ P ( j},

 abstract = {We give a novel algorithm for stochastic strongly-convex optimization in the gradient oracle model which returns an $O(\frac1T)$-approximate solution after $T$ gradient updates. This rate of convergence is optimal in the gradientoracle model. This improves upon the previously known best rate of $O(\frac{\log(T)}{T})$, which was obtained by applying an online strongly-convex optimization algorithm with regret $O(\log(T))$ to the batch setting. We complement this result by proving that any algorithm has expected regret of $\Omega(\log(T))$ in the online stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting. This lower bound holds even in the full-information setting which reveals more information to the algorithm than just gradients. This shows that any online-to-batch conversion is inherently suboptimal for stochastic strongly-convex optimization. This is the first formal evidence that online convex optimization is strictly more difficult than batch stochastic convex optimization.},

To estimate the Shannon entropy, it suces to accurately estimate the -th moment with = j1 j 0. To guarantee that the error of estimated Shannon entropy is within a -additive factor, the method of symmetric stable random projections requires O 1 2 2 samples, which is extremely expensive. The rst paper (Li, 2009a) in Compressed Counting (CC), based on skewed-stable random projections, supplies a substantial improvement by reducing the sample complexity to O 1 2 , which is still expensive. The followup work (Li, 2009b) provides a practical algorithm, which is however dicult to analyze theoretically. In this paper, we propose a new accurate algorithm for Compressed Counting, whose sample complexity is only O 1 2 for -additive Shannon entropy estimation. The constant factor for this bound is merely about 6. In addition, we prove that our algorithm achieves an upper bound of the Fisher information and in fact it is close to 100% statistically optimal. An empirical study is conducted to verify the accuracy of our algorithm.},

The proposed classier is obtained by minimizing an empirical objective subject to an empirical constraint. The novelty of the method is that the classier output by this problem is shown to satisfy the original constraint on type I error. This strict enforcement of the constraint has interesting consequences on the control of the type II error and we develop new techniques to handle this situation.

In fact, we claim that previous diculties partially stemmed from a mismatch between the standard learning-theoretic modeling of collaborative ltering, and its practical application. Our results also shed some light on the issue of collaborative ltering with bounded models, which enforce predictions to lie within a certain range.

 abstract = {In a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, an online algorithm makes a sequence of choices. In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms.

We consider similarity information in the setting of contextual bandits, a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the context--a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on web pages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a similarity distance between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs.

Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses uniform partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition. Algorithms based on uniform partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions, and take advantage of benign payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space. Our results apply to several other settings, e.g., MAB with constrained temporal change (Slivkins and Upfal, 2008) and sleeping bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008a).},

 abstract = {Clusters are often dened to be the connected components of a density level set. Unfortunately, this denition depends on a level that needs to be user specied by some means. In this paper we present a simple algorithm that is able to asymptotically determine the optimal level, that is, the level at which there is the rst split in the cluster tree of the data generating distribution. We further show that this algorithm asymptotically recovers the corresponding connected components. Unlike previous work, our analysis does not require strong assumptions on the density such as continuity or even smoothness.},

 abstract = {A popular approach in reinforcement learning is to use a model-based algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that utilizes a model learner to learn an approximate model to the environment. It has been shown that such a model-based learner is ecient if the model learner is ecient in the so-called \knows what it knows (KWIK) framework. A major limitation of the standard KWIK framework is that, by its very denition, it covers only the case when the (model) learner can represent the actual environment with no errors. In this paper, we study the agnostic KWIK learning model, where we relax this assumption by allowing nonzero approximation errors. We show that with the new denition an ecient model learner still leads to an ecient reinforcement learning algorithm. At the same time, though, we nd that learning within the new framework can be substantially slower as compared to the standard framework, even in the case of simple learning problems.},

 abstract = {A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary. Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected L2 error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of l1 regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of O(√np ln(mλ)/m), where n is the dimension, p is the number of elements in the dictionary, λ is a bound on the l1 norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most k dictionary elements, we provide a bound of the order O(√np ln(mk)/m) under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as 1/m, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.},

 abstract = {Mixability of a loss characterizes fast rates in the online learning setting of prediction with expert advice. The determination of the mixability constant for binary losses is straight forward but opaque. In the binary case we make this transparent and simpler by characterising mixability in terms of the second derivative of the Bayes risk of proper losses. We then extend this result to multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results. We show that mixability is governed by the maximum eigenvalue of the Hessian of the Bayes risk, relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We conclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds prediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk. Although all calculations are for proper losses, we also show how to carry the results across to improper losses.},

 abstract = {We explore a transfer learning setting, in which a finite sequence of target concepts are sampled independently with an unknown distribution from a known family. We study the total number of labeled examples required to learn all targets to an arbitrary specified expected accuracy, focusing on the asymptotics in the number of tasks and the desired accuracy. Our primary interest is formally understanding the fundamental benefits of transfer learning, compared to learning each target independently from the others. Our approach to the transfer problem is general, in the sense that it can be used with a variety of learning protocols. The key insight driving our approach is that the distribution of the target concepts is identifiable from the joint distribution over a number of random labeled data points equal the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the concept space. This is not necessarily the case for the joint distribution over any smaller number of points. This work has particularly interesting implications when applied to active learning methods.},
