We design an algorithm and prove that apart from logarithmic factors its regret up to time $T$ is $O(\sqrt{T})$. Unlike previous approaches that use a forced-exploration scheme, we construct a high-probability confidence set around the model parameters and design an algorithm that plays optimistically with respect to this confidence set. The construction of the confidence set is based on the recent results from online least-squares estimation and leads to improved worst-case regret bound for the proposed algorithm. To the best of our knowledge this is the the first time that a regret bound is derived for the LQ control problem.}

The goal of the learner is to minimize his regret, which is the difference between his total cumulative loss and the total loss of the best fixed action in hindsight. Assuming that the outcomes are generated in an i.i.d. fashion from an arbitrary and unknown probability distribution, we characterize the minimax regret of any partial monitoring game with finitely many actions and outcomes. It turns out that the minimax regret of any such game is either zero, $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T}), \Theta(T^{2/3})$, or $\Theta(T)$. We provide a computationally efficient learning algorithm that achieves the minimax regret within logarithmic factor for any game.}

In particular, the learning algorithm is required in this problem to guarantee differential privacy, a very strong notion of privacy that has gained significant attention in recent years. A natural question to ask is: what is the sample requirement of a learning algorithm that guarantees a certain level of privacy and accuracy? We address this question in the context of learning with infinite hypothesis classes when the data is drawn from a continuous distribution. We first show that even for very simple hypothesis classes, any algorithmth at uses a finite number of examples and guarantees differential privacy must fail to return an accurate classifier for at least some unlabeled data distributions. This result is unlike the case with either finite hypothesis classes or discrete data domains, in which distribution-free private learning is possible, as previously shown by Kasiviswanathan et al. (2008). We then consider two approaches to differentially private learning that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use prior knowledge about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution $\mathcal{U}$ chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference $\mathcal{U}$, we provide an upper bound on the sample requirement that depends (among other things) on a measure of closeness between $\mathcal{U}$ and the unlabeled data distribution. Our upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case. The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only label-privacy ânamely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled parts of the examples)be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et al. (2006); in this work, we show a lower bound.}

The main focus is on the situation where the number of relevant covariates, called intrinsic dimension, is much smaller than the ambient dimension. Without assuming any parametric form of the underlying regression function, we get tight conditions making it possible to consistently estimate the set of relevant variables. These conditions relate the intrinsic dimension to the ambient dimension and to the sample size.  The procedure that is provably consistent under these tight conditions is simple and is based on comparing the empirical Fourier coefficients with an appropriately chosen threshold value.}

We study the learnability of multiclass prediction, and derive upper and lower bounds on the sample complexity of multiclass hypothesis classes in different learning models: batch/online, realizable/unrealizable,full information/bandit feedback.  Our analysis reveals a surprising phenomenon: In the multiclass setting, in sharp contrast to binary classification, not all Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) algorithms are equally successful. We show that there exist hypotheses classes for which some ERM learners have lower sample complexity than others. Furthermore, there are classes that are learnable by some ERM learners, while other ERM learner will fail to learn them. We propose a principle for designing good ERM learners, and use this principle to prove tight bounds on the sample complexity of learning symmetric multiclass hypothesis classes (that is, classes that are invariant under any permutation of label names). We demonstrate the relevance of the theory by analyzing the sample complexity of two widely used hypothesis classes: generalized linear multiclass models and reduction trees. We also obtain some practically relevant conclusions.}

We then extend this result to multiclass proper losses where there are few existing results.  We show that mixability is governed by the Hessian of the Bayes risk, relative to the Hessian of the Bayes risk for log loss. We conclude by comparing our result to other work that bounds prediction performance in terms of the geometry of the Bayes risk.

Linear threshold functions and their various subclasses, such as conjunctions and decision lists, play a fundamental role in learning theory and hence their evolvability has been the primary focus of research on Valiantâs framework. One of the main open problems regarding the model is whether conjunctions are evolvable distribution-independently (Feldman and Valiant, 2008). We show that the answer is negative. Our proof is based on a new combinatorial parameter of a concept class that lower-bounds the complexity of learning from correlations. We contrast the lower bound with a proof that linear threshold functions having a non-negligible margin on the data points are evolvable distribution-independently via a simple mutation algorithm. Our algorithm relies on a non-linear loss function being used to select the hypotheses instead of 0-1 loss in Valiantâs original definition. The proof of evolvability requires that the loss function satisfies several mild conditions that are, for example, satisfied by the quadratic loss function studied in several other works (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009b; Valiant, 2011). An important property of our evolution algorithm is monotonicity, that is the algorithm guarantees evolvability without any decreases in performance. Previously, monotone evolvability was only shown for conjunctions with quadratic loss (Feldman, 2009b) or when the distribution on the domain is severely restricted (Michael, 2007; Feldman, 2009b; Kanade et al., 2010).}

We introduce a new approach to understanding the learnability of âsimpleâ monotone functions that is based on a recent characterization of Strong SQ learnability by Simon (2007). Using the characterization we first show that depth-3 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned by any polynomial-time SQ algorithm to accuracy $1 - 1/(\log n)^{\Omega(1)}$.  We then build on this result to show that depth-4 monotone formulas of size $n^{o(1)}$ cannot be learned even to a certain $\frac 1 2 + o(1)$ accuracy in polynomial time.  This improved hardness is achieved using a general technique that we introduce for amplifying the hardness of âmildly hardâ learning problems in either the PAC or SQ framework. Thi shardness amplification for learning builds on the ideas in the work of OâDonnell (2004) on hardness amplification for approximating functions using small circuits, and is applicable to a number of other contexts. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can also be used to reduce the well-known open problem of learning juntas to learning of depth-3 monotone formulas.}

Though these approaches are effective, to the best of our knowledge, there is no theoretical result on the convergence of risk of the learned functions to the Bayes risk. In this paper, focusing on two well-known multi-label loss functions, i.e., ranking loss and hamming loss, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of multi-label learning based on surrogate loss functions. Our results disclose that, surprisingly, none convex surrogate loss is consistent with the ranking loss. Inspired by the finding, we introduce the partial ranking loss, with which some surrogate functions are consistent. For hamming loss, we show that some recent multi-label learning approaches are inconsistent even for deterministic multi-label classification, and give a surrogate loss function which is consistent for the deterministic case. Finally, we discuss on the consistency of learning approaches which address multi-label learning by decomposing into a set of binary classification problems.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper presents a finite-time analysis of the KL-UCB algorithm, an online, horizon-free  index policy for stochastic bandit problems.  We prove two distinct results: first, for arbitrary bounded rewards, the KL-UCB algorithm  satisfies a uniformly better regret bound than UCB and its variants; second, in the special case of  Bernoulli rewards, it reaches the lower bound of Lai and Robbins.  Furthermore, we show that simple adaptations of the KL-UCB algorithm are also optimal for  specific classes of (possibly unbounded) rewards, including those generated from exponential  families of distributions.  A large-scale numerical study comparing KL-UCB with its main competitors (UCB, MOSS,  UCB-Tuned, UCB-V, DMED) shows that KL-UCB is remarkably efficient and stable, including for short time horizons. KL-UCB is also the only method that always performs better  than the basic UCB policy.  Our regret bounds rely on deviations results of independent interest which are stated and proved  in the Appendix. As a by-product, we also obtain an improved regret bound for the standard UCB  algorithm.}

We prove such regret bounds for an online-learning algorithm called SeqSEW and based on exponential weighting and data-driven truncation. In a second part we apply a parameter-free version of this algorithm on i.i.d. data and derive risk bounds of the same flavor as in Dalalyan and Tsybakov (2008, 2011) but which solve two questions left open therein. In particular our risk bounds are adaptive (up to a logarithmic factor) to the unknown variance of the noise if the latter is Gaussian.}

This improves upon the previously known best rate of $O(\frac{\log(T)}{T})$, which was obtained by applying an online strongly-convex optimization algorithm with regret $O(\log(T))$ to the batch setting. We complement this result by proving that any algorithm has expected regret of $\Omega(\log(T))$ in the online stochastic strongly-convex optimization setting. This lower bound holds even in the full-information setting which reveals more information to the algorithm than just gradients. This shows that any online-to-batch conversion is inherently suboptimal for stochastic strongly-convex optimization. This is the first formal evidence that online convex optimization is strictly more difficult than batch stochastic convex optimization.}

To estimate the Shannon entropy, it suffices to accurately estimate the $\alpha$-th  moment with $\delta= |1-\alpha|\approx 0$. To guarantee that the error of estimated Shannon entropy is within a $\upsilon$-additive factor, the method of symmetric stable random projections requires $O\left(\frac{1}{\upsilon^2\Delta^2}\right)$ samples, which is extremely expensive. The first paperÂ (Li, 2009a) in Compressed Counting (CC), based on skewed-stable random projections, supplies a substantial improvement by reducing the sample complexity to $O\left(\frac{1}{\upsilon^2\Delta}\right)$, which is still  expensive. The followup work (Li, 2009b) provides a  practical algorithm, which is however  difficult to analyze theoretically. In this paper, we propose a new   accurate algorithm for Compressed Counting, whose sample complexity is only $O\left(\frac{1}{\upsilon^2}\right)$ for $\upsilon$-additive Shannon entropy estimation. The constant factor for this bound is merely about $6$.  In addition, we prove that our algorithm achieves an upper bound of the Fisher information and in fact it is  close to $100\%$  statistically optimal.  An empirical study is  conducted to verify the accuracy of our algorithm.}

Our second result is that within  $C/\varepsilon$ iterations, AdaBoost achieves a value of the  exponential loss that is at most $\varepsilon$ more than the best  possible value, where $C$ depends on the dataset.

The proposed classifier is obtained by minimizing an empirical objective subject to an empirical constraint. The novelty of the method is that the classifier output by this problem is shown to satisfy the original constraint on typeÂ I error. This strict enforcement of the constraint has interesting consequences on the control of the typeÂ II error and we develop new techniques to handle this situation.

In each round it chooses from a time-invariant set of alternatives and receives the payoff associated with this alternative. While the case of small strategy sets is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on MAB problems with exponentially or infinitely large  strategy sets, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, recent literature considered information on similarity between arms. We consider similarity information in the setting of contextual bandits, a natural extension of the basic MAB problem where before each round an algorithm is given the context â a hint about the payoffs in this round. Contextual bandits are directly motivated by placing advertisements on webpages, one of the crucial problems in sponsored search. A particularly simple way to represent similarity information in the contextual bandit setting is via a similarity distance between the context-arm pairs which bounds from above the difference between the respective expected payoffs. Prior work on contextual bandits with similarity uses âuniformâ partitions of the similarity space, so that each context-arm pair is approximated by the closest pair in the partition. Algorithms based on âuniformâ partitions disregard the structure of the payoffs and the context arrivals, which is potentially wasteful. We present algorithms that are based on adaptive partitions, and take advantage of âbenignâ payoffs and context arrivals without sacrificing the worst-case performance. The central idea is to maintain a finer partition in high-payoff regions of the similarity space and in popular regions of the context space. Our results apply to several other settings, e.g. MAB with constrained temporal changeÂ (Slivkins and Upfal, 2008) and sleeping bandits (Kleinberg et al., 2008a).}

  abstract = 	 {Clusters are often defined to be the connected components of a density level set. Unfortunately, this definition depends on a level that needs to be user specified by some means. In this paper we present a simple algorithm that is able to asymptotically determine the optimal level, that is, the level at which there is the first split in the cluster tree of the data generating distribution. We further show that this algorithm asymptotically recovers the corresponding connected components. Unlike previous work, our analysis does not require strong assumptions on the density such as continuity or even smoothness.}

  abstract = 	 {A popular approach in reinforcement learning is to use a model-based algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that utilizes a model learner to learn an approximate model to the  environment. It has been shown that  such a model-based learner is efficient  if the model learner is efficient  in the so-called âknows what it knowsâ  (KWIK)  framework. A major limitation of the standard KWIK framework is that, by its very definition, it covers only the case when the (model) learner can represent  the actual environment with no errors. In this paper, we study the agnostic KWIK learning model, where we relax this assumption by allowing nonzero approximation errors. We show that with the new definition  an efficient model learner still leads to an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm. At the same time, though, we find that learning within the new framework can be substantially slower as compared to the standard framework, even in the case of simple learning problems.}

  abstract = 	 {A large set of signals can sometimes be described sparsely using a dictionary, that is, every element can be represented as a linear combination of few elements from the dictionary.  Algorithms for various signal processing applications, including classification, denoising and signal separation, learn a dictionary from a given set of signals to be represented. Can we expect that the error in representing by such a dictionary a previously unseen signal from the same source will be of similar magnitude as those for the given examples? We assume signals are generated from a fixed distribution, and study these questions from a statistical learning theory perspective. We develop generalization bounds on the quality of the learned dictionary for two types of constraints on the coefficient selection, as measured by the expected $L_2$ error in representation when the dictionary is used. For the case of $l_1$ regularized coefficient selection we provide a generalization bound of the order of $O\left(\sqrt{np\ln(m Î»)/m}\right)$, where $n$ is the dimension, $p$ is the number of elements in the dictionary, Î»is a bound on the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient vector and m is the number of samples, which complements existing results. For the case of representing a new signal as a combination of at most $k$ dictionary elements, we provide a bound ofthe order $O(\sqrt{np\ln(m  k)/m})$ under an assumption on the closeness to orthogonality of the dictionary (low Babel function). We further show that this assumption holds for most dictionaries in high dimensions in a strong probabilistic sense. Our results also include bounds that converge as $1/m$, not previously known for this problem. We provide similar results in a general setting using kernels with weak smoothness requirements.}

We study the total number of labeled examples required to learn all targets to an arbitrary specified expected accuracy, focusing on the asymptotics in the number of tasks and the desired accuracy.  Our primary interest is formally understanding the fundamental benefits of transfer learning, compared to learning each target independently from the others. Our approach to the transfer problem is general, in the sense that it can be used with a variety of learning protocols.  The key insight driving our approach is that the distribution of the target concepts is identifiable from the joint distribution over a number of random labeled data points equal the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the concept space.  This is not necessarily the case for the joint distribution over any smaller number of points. This work has particularly interesting implications when applied to active learning methods.}

For Bayesianprediction and estimation methods, it is often easy to obtain bounds on the cumulative risk. Such results are based on bounding the individual sequence regret, a technique that is very well known in the COLT community. Motivated by the easiness of proofs for the cumulative risk, our open problem is to use the results on cumulative risk to prove corresponding individual-risk bounds.}
