 abstract = {Kernel supervised principal component analysis (KSPCA) is a computationally ecient supervised feature extraction method that can learn non-linear transformations. We start the study of the statistical properties of KSPCA, providing the rst bound on its sample complexity. This bound is dimension-independent, which justies the good performance of KSPCA on high-dimensional data. Another observation is that in the kernelized version, the number of parameters of KSPCA grows linearly with the sample size. While this potentially increases the risk of over-tting, KSPCA works well in practice. In this work, we justify this compelling characteristic of KSPCA by providing a guarantee indicating that KSPCA generalizes well even when the number of parameters is large, as long as they have small norms.},

 abstract = {Learning distance metrics from data is a fundamental problem in machine learning and useful way to extract data-driven features by using the matrix root of a distance matrix. Finding a proper metric amounts to optimization over the cone of positive definite (PD) matrices. This optimization is difficult since restricting optimization to remain within the PD cone or repeatedly projecting to the cone is prohibitively costly. Here we describe COMET, a block-coordinate descent procedure, which efficiently keeps the search within the PD cone, avoiding both costly projections and unnecessary computation of full gradients. COMET also continuously maintains the Cholesky root of the matrix, providing feature extraction and embedding of samples in a metric space. We further develop a structurally sparse variant of COMET, where only a small number of features interacts with other features. SparseCOMET significantly accelerates both training and inference while improving interpretability. As a block-coordinate descent procedure, COMET has fast convergence bounds showing linear convergence with high probability. When tested on benchmark datasets in a task of retrieving similar images and similar text documents, COMET has significantly better precision than competing projection-free methods. Furthermore, sparse-COMET achieves almost identical precision as dense-COMET in document classification, while running◊4.5 faster, maintaining a 0.5% sparsity level, and outperforming competing methods both in precision and in run time.},

 abstract = {Deep neural networks currently stand at the state of the art for many machine learning applications, yet there still remain limitations in the training of such networks because of their very high parameter dimensionality. In this paper we show that network training performance can be improved using a stage-wise learning strategy, in which the learning process is broken down into a number of related sub-tasks that are completed stage-bystage. The idea is to inject the information to the network gradually so that in the early stages of training the \coarse-scale properties of the data are captured while the \nerscale characteristics are learned in later stages. Moreover, the solution found in each stage serves as a prior to the next stage, which produces a regularization eect and enhances the generalization of the learned representations. We show that decoupling the classier layer from the feature extraction layers of the network is necessary, as it alleviates the diusion of gradient and over-tting problems. Experimental results in the context of image classication support these claims.},

We present an algorithm, Voted Kernel Regularization, that provides the flexibility of using very complex kernel functions such as predictors based on high-degree polynomial kernels or narrow Gaussian kernels, while benefitting from strong learning guarantees. We show that our algorithm benefits from strong learning guarantees suggesting a new regularization penalty depending on the Rademacher complexities of the families of kernel functions used. Our algorithm admits several other favorable properties: its optimization problem is convex, it allows for learning with non-PDS kernels, and the solutions are highly sparse, resulting in improved classification speed and memory requirements.

Utilizing recent theoretical results in high dimensional statistical modeling, we propose a model-free yet computationally simple approach to estimate the partially linear model Y = X +g(Z)+. Based on partitioning the support of Z, a simple local average is used to approximate the response surface g(Z). The model can be estimated via least squares and no tuning parameter is needed. The proposed method seeks to strike a balance between computation burden and eciency of the estimators while minimizing model bias. The desired theoretical properties of the proposed estimators are established. Moreover, since the proposed method bypasses data-driven bandwith selection of traditional nonparametric methods, it avoids the further eciency loss due to computation burden.},

 abstract = {We present a framework for feature extraction and mode decomposition of spatiotemporal data generated by ergodic dynamical systems. Unlike feature extraction techniques based on kernel operators, our approach is to construct feature maps using eigenfunctions of the Koopman group of unitary operators governing the dynamical evolution of observables and probability measures. We compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Koopman group through a Galerkin scheme applied to time-ordered data without requiring a priori knowledge of the dynamical evolution equations. This scheme employs a data-driven set of basis functions on the state space manifold, computed through the diusion maps algorithm and a variable-bandwidth kernel designed to enforce orthogonality with respect to the invariant measure of the dynamics. The features extracted via this approach have strong timescale separation, favorable predictability properties, and high smoothness on the state space manifold. The extracted features are also invariant under weakly restrictive changes of observation modality. We apply this scheme to a synthetic dataset featuring superimposed traveling waves in a one-dimensional periodic domain and satellite observations of organized convection in the tropical atmosphere.},

Model parameters are estimated via CP decomposition of the observed higher order input moments. However, in many domains, additional invariances such as shift invariances exist, enforced via models such as convolutional dictionary learning. In this paper, we develop novel tensor decomposition algorithms for parameter estimation of convolutional models. Our algorithm is based on the popular alternating least squares method, but with efficient projections onto the space of stacked circulant matrices. Our method is embarrassingly parallel and consists of simple operations such as fast Fourier transforms and matrix multiplications. Our algorithm converges to the dictionary much faster and more accurately compared to the alternating minimization over filters and activation maps.},

In this paper, we build upon a novel framework called FEAST(Feature ExtrAction using Score function Tensors) which incorporates generative models for discriminative learning. FEAST considers a novel class of matrix and tensor-valued feature transform, which can be pre-trained using unlabeled samples. It uses an ecient algorithm for extracting discriminative information, given these pre-trained features and labeled samples for any related task. The class of features it adopts are based on higher-order score functions, which capture local variations in the probability density function of the input. We employ ecient spectral decomposition algorithms (on matrices and tensors) for extracting discriminative components. The advantage of employing tensor-valued features is that we can extract richer discriminative information in the form of overcomplete representations (where number of discriminative features is greater than input dimension). In this paper, we provide preliminary experiment results on real datasets.},

We show that two well-known covariance priors, Wishart Process and Inverse Wishart Process, boil down to a two-layer feed-forward network of GPs with a particular kernel function on the neuron at the output layer. Both of these models perform supervised manifold learning and target prediction jointly. Also, the resultant kernel functions of both of these priors lead to feature maps of nite dimensionality. Motivated by this fact, we promote replacing these kernels with the Radial Basis Function (RBF), which gives an innite dimensional feature map, enhancing the model exibility. We demonstrate on one benchmark task and two challenging medical image analysis tasks that our GP network with RBF kernel largely outperforms the earlier two covariance priors. We show also that it straightforwardly allows non-linear combination of dierent data views, leading to state-of-the-art multiple kernel learning only as a by-product.},

However, in practice the network architecture has to be manually set by domain experts, generally by a costly trial and error procedure, which often accounts for a large portion of the final system performance. We view this as a limitation and propose a novel training algorithm that automatically optimizes network architecture, by progressively increasing model complexity and then eliminating model redundancy by selectively removing parameters at training time. For convolutional neural networks, our method relies on iterative split/merge clustering of convolutional kernels interleaved by stochastic gradient descent.

In this paper, we show generalization error bounds for learning localized kernel classes where the localities are coupled using graph-based regularization. We propose a novel learning localized kernels algorithm based on this hypothesis class that is formulated as a convex optimization problem using a pre-obtained cluster structure of the data. We derive dual representations using Fenchel conjugation theory, based on which we give a simple yet efficient wrapper-based optimization algorithm.

 abstract = {Abstract: Recent success in training deep neural networks have prompted active investigation into the features learned on their intermediate layers. Such research is difficult because it requires making sense of non-linear computations performed by millions of parameters, but valuable because it increases our ability to understand current models and create improved versions of them. In this paper we investigate the extent to which neural networks exhibit what we call convergent learning, which is when the representations learned by multiple nets converge to a set of features which are either individually similar between networks or where subsets of features span similar low-dimensional spaces. We propose a specific method of probing representations: training multiple networks and then comparing and contrasting their individual, learned representations at the level of neurons or groups of neurons. We begin research into this question using three techniques to approximately align different neural networks on a feature level: a bipartite matching approach that makes one-to-one assignments between neurons, a sparse prediction approach that finds one-to-many mappings, and a spectral clustering approach that finds many-to-many mappings. This initial investigation reveals a few previously unknown properties of neural networks, and we argue that future research into the question of convergent learning will yield many more. The insights described here include (1) that some features are learned reliably in multiple networks, yet other features are not consistently learned; (2) that units learn to span low-dimensional subspaces and, while these subspaces are common to multiple networks, the specific basis vectors learned are not; (3) that the representation codes show evidence of being a mix between a local code and slightly, but not fully, distributed codes across multiple units.},

 abstract = {Deep neural networks are being widely used for feature representation learning in diverse problem areas ranging from object recognition and speech recognition to robotic perception and human disease prediction. We demonstrate a novel, perhaps the first application of deep learning in mechanical design, specifically to learn complex microfluidic flow patterns in order to solve inverse problems in fluid mechanics. A recent discovery showed the ability to control the fluid deformations in a microfluidic channel by placing a sequence of pillars. This provides a fundamental tool for numerous material science, manufacturing and biological applications. However, designing pillar sequences for user-defined deformations is practically infeasible as the current process requires laborious and time-consuming design iterations in a very large, highly nonlinear design space that can have as large as 10 possibilities. We demonstrate that hierarchical feature extraction can potentially lead to a scalable design tool via learning semantic representations from a relatively small number of flow pattern examples. The paper compares the performances of pre-trained deep neural networks and deep convolutional neural networks as well as their learnt features. We show that a balanced training data generation process with respect to a metric on the output space improves the feature extraction performance. Overall, the deep learning based design process is shown to expedite the current state-of-the-art design approaches by more than 600 times.},

 abstract = {An approach inspired by the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle is proposed for adaptively selecting features during online learning based on their usefulness in improving the objective. The approach eliminates noisy or useless features from the optimization process, leading to improved loss. Several algorithmic variations on the approach are presented. They are based on using a Bayesian mixture in each of the dimensions of the feature space. By utilizing the MDL principle, the mixture reduces the dimensionality of the feature space to its subspace with the lowest loss. Bounds on the loss, derived, show that the loss for that subspace is essentially achieved. The approach can be tuned for trading o between model size and the loss incurred. Empirical results on large scale real-world systems demonstrate how it improves such tradeos. Huge model size reductions can be achieved with no loss in performance relative to standard techniques, while moderate loss improvements (translating to large regret improvements) are achieved with moderate size reductions. The results also demonstrate that overtting is eliminated by this approach.},

 abstract = {The problem of extracting features from given input data is of critical importance for the successful application of machine learning. Feature extraction, as usually understood, seeks an optimal transformation from input data into a (typically real-valued) feature vector that can be used as an input for a learning algorithm. Over time, this problem has been attacked using a growing number of diverse techniques that originated in separate research communities, including feature selection, dimensionality reduction, manifold learning, distance metric learning and representation learning. The goal of this paper is to contrast and compare feature extraction techniques coming from different machine learning areas, discuss the modern challenges and open problems in feature extraction and suggest novel solutions to some of them.},

 abstract = {This paper improves and extends the two-step penalized iterative estimation procedure for the linear mixed effect model (LMM) by explicitly penalizing the off-diagonal components of the covariance matrix of random effects. To explicitly penalize the off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix of random effects, glasso is incorporated in the penalized LMM approach. The paper also provides theoretical justification and a computational algorithm for the provided approach. Empirical analysis using random simulated data shows that explicitly penalizing the off-diagonal covariance components can greatly improve the model selection procedure.},
