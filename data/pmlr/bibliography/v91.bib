 abstract = {This study investigates a method for predicting compound risk based on in vitro assay data and estimated $C_\textitmax$, the maximum concentration of a drug in the body. The method makes use of Venn-Abers predictors and Support Vector Machines to compute compound risk with respect to a biological target. The method has been applied to in vitro ion-channel data generated to assess cardiac risk and introduces a more intuitive way to reflect cardiac risk.},

 abstract = {Iterative screening, where selected hits from a given round of screening are used to enrich a compound activity prediction model for the next iteration, enables more efficient screening campaigns. The portion of the compound library that should be screened in each iteration is often arbitrarily decided. This is because no accurate information between screening size and the number of hits to be retrieved exists. In this article, a novel method based on Venn-Abers predictors was used to determine the optimal number of compounds to be screened in order to get a desired number of hits. We found that Venn-Abers predictors provide accurate information to support a reliable and flexible decision about the portion size of the compound library that should be screened in each iteration. In addition, the method exhibited great ability in producing an enriched subset in terms of hits and their diversity.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of feature selection for unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) in time-series, where only normal examples are available for training. We develop a method based on exchangeability martingales that only keeps features that exhibit the same pattern (i.e., are i.i.d.) under normal conditions of the observed phenomenon. We apply this to the problem of monitoring a Windows service and detecting anomalies it exhibits if compromised; results show that our method: i) strongly improves the AD systemâs performance, and ii) it reduces its computational complexity. Furthermore, it gives results that are easy to interpret for analysts, and it potentially increases robustness against AD evasion attacks.},

 abstract = {This study examines the use of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework for the provision of confidence information in the detection of seizures in electroencephalograph (EEG) recordings. The detection of seizures is an important task since EEG recordings of seizures are of primary interest in the evaluation of epileptic patients. However, manual review of long-term EEG recordings for detecting and analyzing seizures that may have occurred is a time-consuming process. Therefore a technique for automatic detection of seizures in such recordings is highly beneficial since it can be used to significantly reduce the amount of data in need of manual review. Additionally, due to the infrequent and unpredictable occurrence of seizures, having high sensitivity is crucial for seizure detection systems. This is the main motivation for this study, since CP can be used for controlling the error rate of predictions and therefore guaranteeing an upper bound on the frequency of false negatives.},

More importantly, using SVM+ in a conformal prediction framework enables valid prediction intervals at specified significance levels.},

We examine the classic aggregating algorithms based on the exponential reweighing. For the general Vovk's aggregating algorithm we provide its generalization for the long-term forecasting. For the special basic case of Vovk's algorithm we provide its two modifications for the long-term forecasting. The first one is theoretically close to an optimal algorithm and is based on replication of independent copies. It provides the time-independent regret bound with respect to the best expert in the pool. The second one is not optimal but is more practical and has $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, where $T$ is the length of the game.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v91-kuleshov18a,
 abstract = {The paper presents a geometrically motivated view on conformal prediction applied to nonlinear multi-output regression tasks for obtaining valid measure of accuracy of Manifold Learning Regression algorithms. A considered regression task is to estimate an unknown smooth mapping $\mathbff$ from $q$-dimensional inputs $\mathbfx â\mathbfX$ to $m$-dimensional outputs $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$ based on training dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$ consisting of âinput-outputâ pairs ${Z_i = (\mathbfx_i, \mathbfy_i = \mathbff(\mathbfx_i))^\textrmT, i = 1, 2, ..., n}$. Manifold Learning Regression (MLR) algorithm solves this task using Manifold learning technique. At first, unknown $q$-dimensional Regression manifold $\mathbfM(\mathbff) = {(\mathbfx,\mathbff(\mathbfx))^\textrmTâ\mathrmR^q+m: \mathbfx â\mathbfX â\mathrmR^q}$, embedded in ambient $(q+m)$-dimensional space, is estimated from the training data $\mathbfZ_(n)$, sampled from this manifold. The constructed estimator $\mathbfM_\textMLR$, which is also $q$-dimensional manifold embedded in ambient space $\textrmR^q+m$, is close to $\mathbfM$ in terms of Hausdorff distance. After that, an estimator $\mathbff_\textMLR$ of the unknown function $\mathbff$, mapping arbitrary input $\mathbfx â\mathbfX$ to output $\mathbff_\textrmMLR(\mathbfx)$, is constructed as the solution to the equation $\mathbfM(\mathbff_\textrmMLR) = \mathbfM_\textMLR$. Conformal prediction allows constructing a prediction region for an unknown output $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$ at Out-of-Sample input point $\mathbfx$ for a given confidence level using given nonconformity measure, characterizing to which extent an example $Z = (\mathbfx, \mathbfy)^\textrmT$ is different from examples in the known dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$. The paper proposes a new nonconformity measure based on MLR estimator using an analog of Bregman distance.},

 abstract = {Venn predictors are a distribution-free probabilistic prediction framework that transforms the output of a scoring classifier into a (multi-)probabilistic prediction that has calibration guarantees, with the only requirement of an i.i.d. assumption for calibration and test data. In this paper, we extend the framework from classification (where probabilities are predicted for a discrete number of labels) to regression (where labels form a continuum). We show how Venn Predictors can be applied on top of any regression method to obtain calibrated predictive distributions, without requiring assumptions beyond i.i.d. of calibration and test sets. This is contrasted with methods such as Bayesian Linear Regression, for which the calibration guarantee instead relies on specific probabilistic assumptions on the distribution of the data. The adaptation of Venn Machine to regression required a theoretical analysis of the transductive and inductive forms of the predictor. We identify potential consistency problems and provide solutions for them. Finally, to illustrate their advantages, we apply regression Venn Predictors to the medical problem of predicting the survival time after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, a potentially risky procedure that improves blood flow to a patientâs heart. The predictive distributions obtained with this method allow a variety of interpretations that include probability of survival time exceeding a chosen threshold or the shortest survival time guaranteed with a given probability.},

In these fields, the learning scenarios are naturally changing but often remain related to each other motivating the reuse of existing supervised models. Current transfer learning models are neither sparse nor interpretable. Sparsity is very desirable if the methods have to be used in technically limited environments and interpretability is getting more critical due to privacy regulations. In this work, we propose two transfer learning extensions integrated into the sparse and interpretable probabilistic classification vector machine. They are compared to standard benchmarks in the field and show their relevance either by sparsity or performance improvements.},

The resulting methodology of conformal predictive decision making is illustrated on a small benchmark data set.
