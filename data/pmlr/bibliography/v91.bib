  abstract = 	 {Successful use of probabilistic classification requires well-calibrated probability estimates, i.e., the predicted class probabilities must correspond to the true probabilities. The standard solution is to employ an additional step, transforming the outputs from a classifier into probability estimates. In this paper, Venn predictors are compared to Platt scaling and isotonic regression, for the purpose of producing well-calibrated probabilistic predictions from decision trees. The empirical investigation, using 22 publicly available data sets, showed that the probability estimates from the Venn predictor were extremely well-calibrated. In fact, in a direct comparison using the accepted reliability metric, the Venn predictor estimates were the most exact on every data set.}

  abstract = 	 {Venn predictors are a distribution-free probabilistic prediction framework that transforms the output of a scoring classifier into a (multi-)probabilistic prediction that has calibration guarantees, with the only requirement of an i.i.d. assumption for calibration and test data. In this paper, we extend the framework from classification (where probabilities are predicted for a discrete number of labels) to regression (where labels form a continuum). We show how Venn Predictors can be applied on top of any regression method to obtain calibrated predictive distributions, without requiring assumptions beyond i.i.d. of calibration and test sets. This is contrasted with methods such as Bayesian Linear Regression, for which the calibration guarantee instead relies on specific probabilistic assumptions on the distribution of the data. The adaptation of Venn Machine to regression required a theoretical analysis of the transductive and inductive forms of the predictor. We identify potential consistency problems and provide solutions for them. Finally, to illustrate their advantages, we apply regression Venn Predictors to the medical problem of predicting the survival time after Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, a potentially risky procedure that improves blood flow to a patientâs heart. The predictive distributions obtained with this method allow a variety of interpretations that include probability of survival time exceeding a chosen threshold or the shortest survival time guaranteed with a given probability.}

Namely, a major limitation of conformal predictive distributions is that, at this time, they are only applicable to regression problems, where the label is a real number; however, this does not prevent them from being used in a general problem of decision making. The resulting methodology of conformal predictive decision making is illustrated on a small benchmark data set. Our main theoretical observation is that there exists an asymptotically efficient predictive decision-making system which can be obtained by using our methodology (and therefore, satisfying the standard property of validity).}

For the special basic case of Vovkâs algorithm we provide two its modifications for the long-term forecasting. The first one is theoretically close to an optimal algorithm and is based on replication of independent copies. It provides the time-independent regret bound with respect to the best expert in the pool. The second one is not optimal but is more practical (explicitly models dependencies in observations) and has $O(\sqrtT)$ regret bound, where $T$ is the length of the game.}

Then we consider particular types of covariance functions from theoretical and practical points of view. For $\textitMatern_1/2$ covariance function poor estimation of parameters only slightly affects the quality of interpolation. For the most common covariance functions including $\textitMatern_3/2$ and squared exponential covariance functions poor choose of parameters of covariance functions leads to a bad quality of interpolation.}

The detection of seizures is an important task since EEG recordings of seizures are of primary interest in the evaluation of epileptic patients. However, manual review of long-term EEG recordings for detecting and analyzing seizures that may have occurred is a time-consuming process. Therefore a technique for automatic detection of seizures in such recordings is highly beneficial since it can be used to significantly reduce the amount of data in need of manual review. Additionally, due to the infrequent and unpredictable occurrence of seizures, having high sensitivity is crucial for seizure detection systems. This is the main motivation for this study, since CP can be used for controlling the error rate of predictions and therefore guaranteeing an upper bound on the frequency of false negatives.}

A considered regression task is to estimate an unknown smooth mapping $\mathbff$ from $q$-dimensional inputs $\mathbfx â\mathbfX$ to $m$-dimensional outputs $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$ based on training dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$ consisting of âinput-outputâ pairs ${Z_i = (\mathbfx_i, \mathbfy_i = \mathbff(\mathbfx_i))^\textrmT, i = 1, 2, ..., n}$. Manifold Learning Regression (MLR) algorithm solves this task using Manifold learning technique. At first, unknown $q$-dimensional Regression manifold $\mathbfM(\mathbff) = {(\mathbfx,\mathbff(\mathbfx))^\textrmTâ\mathrmR^q+m: \mathbfx â\mathbfX â\mathrmR^q}$, embedded in ambient $(q+m)$-dimensional space, is estimated from the training data $\mathbfZ_(n)$, sampled from this manifold. The constructed estimator $\mathbfM_\textMLR$, which is also $q$-dimensional manifold embedded in ambient space $\textrmR^q+m$, is close to $\mathbfM$ in terms of Hausdorff distance. After that, an estimator $\mathbff_\textMLR$ of the unknown function $\mathbff$, mapping arbitrary input $\mathbfx â\mathbfX$ to output $\mathbff_\textrmMLR(\mathbfx)$, is constructed as the solution to the equation $\mathbfM(\mathbff_\textrmMLR) = \mathbfM_\textMLR$. Conformal prediction allows constructing a prediction region for an unknown output $\mathbfy = \mathbff(\mathbfx)$ at Out-of-Sample input point $\mathbfx$ for a given confidence level using given nonconformity measure, characterizing to which extent an example $Z = (\mathbfx, \mathbfy)^\textrmT$ is different from examples in the known dataset $\mathbfZ_(n)$. The paper proposes a new nonconformity measure based on MLR estimator using an analog of Bregman distance.}
