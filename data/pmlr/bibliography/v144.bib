  abstract = 	 {Model-based reinforcement learning approaches add explicit domain knowledge to agents in hopes of improving the sample-efficiency in comparison to model-free agents. However, in practice model-based methods are unable to achieve the same asymptotic performance on challenging continuous control tasks due to the complexity of learning and controlling an explicit world model. In this paper we investigate the stochastic value gradient (SVG),which is a well-known family of methods for controlling continuous systems which includes model-based approaches that distill a model-based value expansion into a model-free policy. We consider a variant of the model-based SVG that scales to larger systems and uses 1) an entropy regularization to help with exploration,2) a learned deterministic world model to improve the short-horizon value estimate, and 3) a learned model-free value estimate after the modelâs rollout. This SVG variation captures the model-free soft actor-critic method as an instance when the model rollout horizon is zero,and otherwise uses short-horizon model rollouts to improve the value estimate for the policy update. We surpass the asymptotic performance of other model-based methods on the proprioceptive MuJoCo locomotion tasks from the OpenAI gym,including a humanoid. We notably achieve these results with a simple deterministic world model without requiring an ensemble.}

In this paper, we approach this challenge through the following invariance principle: an agent must find a representation such that there exists an action-predictor built on top of this representation that is simultaneously optimal across all training domains. Intuitively, the resulting invariant policy enhances generalization by finding causes of successful actions. We propose a novel learning algorithm, Invariant Policy Optimization (IPO), that implements this principle and learns an invariant policy during training. We compare our approach with standard policy gradient methods and demonstrate significant improvements in generalization performance on unseen domains for linear quadratic regulator and grid-world problems, and an example where a robot must learn to open doors with varying physical properties. }

Despite of its popularity, theoretical guarantees of this method, especially its finite-time performance, are mostly achieved for the linear case while the results for the nonlinear counterpart are very sparse. Motivated by the classic control theory for singularly perturbed systems, we study in this paper the asymptotic convergence and finite-time analysis of the nonlinear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Under some fairly standard assumptions, we provide a formula that characterizes the rate of convergence of the main iterates to the desired solutions. In particular, we show that the method achieves a convergence in expectation at a rate O(1/k^{2/3}), where k is the number of iterations. The key idea in our analysis is to properly choose the two step sizes to  characterize the coupling between the fast and slow-time-scale iterates.}

Specifically, we investigate the Online Multiple Gradient Descent (OMGD) algorithm proposed by Zhang et al. (2017). The original analysis shows that the dynamic regret of OMGD is at most O(min{P_T,S_T}), where P_T and S_T are path-length and squared path-length that measures the cumulative movement of minimizers of the online functions. We demonstrate that by an improved analysis, the dynamic regret of OMGD can be improved to O(min{P_T,S_T,V_T}), where V_T is the function variation of the online functions. Note that the quantities of P_T, S_T, V_T essentially reflect different aspects of environmental non-stationarityâthey are not comparable in general and are favored in different scenarios. Therefore, the dynamic regret presented in this paper actually achieves a \emph{best-of-three-worlds} guarantee, and is strictly tighter than previous results.}

A major practical challenge in the existing system identification methods is the undesirable dependency of their required sample size on the system dimension: roughly speaking, they presume and rely on sample sizes that scale linearly with the system dimension. Evidently, in high-dimensional regime where the system dimension is large, it may be costly, if not impossible, to collect as many samples from the unknown system. In this paper, we introduce an regularized estimator that can accurately estimate the Markov parameters of the system, provided that the number of samples scale poly-logarithmically with the system dimension. Our result significantly improves the sample complexity of learning partially observed linear dynamical systems: it shows that the Markov parameters of the system can be learned in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of samples is significantly smaller than the system dimension.}

  abstract = 	 {There is considerable interest in designing meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) algorithms, which enable autonomous agents to adapt new tasks from small amount of experience. In meta-RL, the specification (such as reward function) of current task is hidden from the agent. In addition, states are hidden within each task owing to sensor noise or limitations in realistic environments. Therefore, the meta-RL agent faces the challenge of specifying both the hidden task and states based on small amount of experience. To address this, we propose estimating disentangled belief about task and states, leveraging an inductive bias that the task and states can be regarded as global and local features of each task. Specifically, we train a hierarchical state-space model (HSSM) parameterized by deep neural networks as an environment model, whose global and local latent variables correspond to task and states, respectively. Because the HSSM does not allow analytical computation of posterior distribution, i.e., belief, we employ amortized inference to approximate it. After the belief is obtained, we can augment observations of a model-free policy with the belief to efficiently train the policy. Moreover, because task and state information are factorized and interpretable, the downstream policy training is facilitated compared with the prior methods that did not consider the hierarchical nature. Empirical validations on a GridWorld environment confirm that the HSSM can separate the hidden task and states information. Then, we compare the meta-RL agent with the HSSM to prior meta-RL methods in MuJoCo environments, and confirm that our agent requires less training data and reaches higher final performance.}

In this paper, we propose to combine the optimal policy search method introduced in (Ferrarotti and Bemporad, 2019) with the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, by relying on weighted surrogate of the experiences of each device, shared with the cloud. A preliminary example shows the effectiveness of the proposed sharing-based method, that results in improved performance with respect to the ones attained when neglecting the similarities among devices and when enforcing consensus among their policies.}

Hence, the reference governor is used to improve the overall closed-loop behavior, resulting into safer maneuvering.

  abstract = 	 {The linear-quadratic controller is one of the fundamental problems in control theory. The optimal solution is a linear controller that requires access to the state of the entire system at any given time. When considering a network system, this renders the optimal controller a centralized one. The interconnected nature of a network system often demands a distributed controller, where different components of the system are controlled based only on local information. Unlike the classical centralized case, obtaining the optimal distributed controller is usually an intractable problem. Thus, we adopt a graph neural network (GNN) as a parametrization of distributed controllers. GNNs are naturally local and have distributed architectures, making them well suited for learning nonlinear distributed controllers. By casting the linear-quadratic problem as a self-supervised learning problem, we are able to find the best GNN-based distributed controller. We also derive sufficient conditions for the resulting closed-loop system to be stable. We run extensive simulations to study the performance of GNN-based distributed controllers and showcase that they are a computationally efficient parametrization with scalability and transferability capabilities.}

State-of-the-art approaches for controlling robots often use memory representations that are excessively rich for the task or rely on handcrafted tricks for memory efficiency. Instead, this work provides a general approach for jointly synthesizing memory representations and policies; the resulting policies actively seek to reduce memory requirements. Specifically, we present a reinforcement learning framework that leverages an implementation of the group LASSO regularization to synthesize policies that employ low-dimensional and task-centric memory representations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach with simulated examples including navigation in discrete and continuous spaces as well as vision-based indoor navigation set in a photo-realistic simulator. The results on these examples indicate that our method is capable of finding policies that rely only on low-dimensional memory representations, improving generalization, and actively reducing memory requirements.}

Given this distributed setting, we develop Constraint-Distributed Continuous Greedy (CDCG), a message passing algorithm that converges to the tight (1-1/e) approximation factor of the optimum global solution using only local computation and communication. It is known that a sequential greedy algorithm can only achieve a 1/2 multiplicative approximation of the optimal solution for this class of problems in the distributed setting. Our framework relies on lifting the discrete problem to a continuous domain and developing a consensus algorithm that achieves the tight (1-1/e) approximation guarantee of the global discrete solution once a proper rounding scheme is applied.  We also offer empirical results from a multi-agent area coverage problem to show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential greedy method.}

  abstract = 	 {We establish data-driven versions of the System Level Synthesis (SLS) parameterization of stabilizing controllers for linear-time-invariant systems.  Inspired by recent work in data-driven control that leverages tools from behavioral theory, we show that optimization problems over system-responses can be posed using only libraries of past system trajectories, without explicitly identifying a system model.  We first consider the idealized setting of noise free trajectories, and show an exact equivalence between traditional and data-driven SLS.  We then show that in the case of a system driven by process noise, tools from robust SLS can be used to characterize the effects of noise on closed-loop performance.  We then draw on tools from matrix concentration to show that a simple trajectory averaging technique can be used to mitigate these effects.  We end with numerical experiments showing the soundness of our methods.}

Kernel methods provide a computationally efficient representation for the classifier that is the solution to a regularized least squares problem. The solution converges almost surely as the sample size increases, and admits known finite sample bounds. This approach is applicable to stochastic systems with arbitrary disturbances and neural network verification problems by treating the network as a dynamical system, or by considering neural network controllers as part of a closed-loop system.

After defining the intrinsic notion of an uninformative optimal policy in terms of a singularity condition for Fisher information we obtain local minimax regret lower bounds for such uninformative instances of LQR by appealing to van Treesâ inequality (Bayesian CramÃ©r-Rao) and a representation of regret in terms of a quadratic form (Bellman error). It is shown that if the parametrization induces an uninformative optimal policy, logarithmic regret is impossible and the rate is at least order square root in the time horizon. We explicitly characterize the notion of an uninformative optimal policy in terms of the nullspaces of system-theoretic quantities and the particular instance parametrization.}

  abstract = 	 {Sample efficiency is one of the key factors when applying policy search to real-world problems. In recent years, Bayesian Optimization (BO) has become prominent in the field of robotics due to its sample efficiency and little prior knowledge needed. However, one drawback of BO is its poor performance on high-dimensional search spaces as it focuses on global search. In the policy search setting, local optimization is typically sufficient as initial policies are often available, e.g., via meta-learning, kinesthetic demonstrations or sim-to-real approaches. In this paper, we propose to constrain the policy search space to a sublevel-set of the Bayesian surrogate modelâs predictive uncertainty. This simple yet effective way of constraining the policy update enables BO to scale to high-dimensional spaces (>100) as well as reduces the risk of damaging the system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of problems, including a motor skills task, adapting deep RL agents to new reward signals and a sim-to-real task for an inverted pendulum system.}

  abstract = 	 {Nonlinear state-space identification for dynamical systems is most often performed by minimizing the simulation error to reduce the effect of model errors. This optimization problem becomes computationally expensive for large datasets. Moreover, the problem is also strongly non-convex, often leading to sub-optimal parameter estimates. This paper introduces a method that approximates the simulation loss by splitting the data set into multiple independent sections similar to the multiple shooting method. This splitting operation allows for the use of stochastic gradient optimization methods which scale well with data set size and has a smoothing effect on the non-convex cost function. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an encoder function to estimate the initial state at the start of each section. The encoder function estimates the initial states using a feed-forward neural network starting from historical input and output samples. The efficiency and performance of the proposed state-space encoder method is illustrated on two well-known benchmarks where, for instance, the method achieves the lowest known simulation error on the WienerâHammerstein benchmark.}

The cost and effort necessary for creating and maintaining first principle models for buildings make data- driven modelling an attractive alternative in this domain. In MPC the models form the basis for an optimization problem whose solution provides the control signals to be applied to the system. The fact that this optimization problem has to be solved repeatedly in real-time implies restrictions on the learning architectures that can be used. Here, we adapt Input Convex Neural Networks that are generally only convex for one-step predictions, for use in building MPC. We introduce additional constraints to their structure and weights to achieve a convex input-output relationship for multi- step ahead predictions. We assess the consequences of the additional constraints for the model accuracy and test the models in a real-life MPC experiment in an apartment in Switzerland. In two five-day cooling experiments, MPC with Input Convex Neural Networks is able to keep room temperatures within comfort constraints while minimizing cooling energy consumption.}

In the present paper, we formally show this feature by deriving and analysing the backward gradient dynamics in continuous time. The proposed Hamiltonian framework, besides encompassing existing networks inspired by marginally stable ODEs, allows one to derive new and more expressive architectures. The good performance of the novel DNNs is demonstrated on benchmark classification problems, including digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.}

We then provide an approach to validate the controller by verifying closed-loop dissipativity in the standard feedback loop based on this parametrization. The developed conditions allow us to state the corresponding controller synthesis problem as a quadratic matrix inequality feasibility problem. Hence, we obtain purely data-driven synthesis conditions leading to a desired closed-loop dissipativity property. Finally, the results are illustrated with a simulation example.}

Simulation results on a linear system with uncertain parameters show a significant performance gain compared to standard approaches. .}

The sampling-and-discarding approach within the scenario approach literature allows the decision maker to trade feasibility to performance. We focus on a removal scheme composed by a cascade of scenario programs that removes at each stage a superset of the support set associated to the optimal solution of each of these programs. This particular removal scheme yields a scenario solution with tight guarantees on the probability of constraint violation; however, existing analysis restricts the number of discarded scenarios to be a multiple of the dimension of the optimisation problem. Motivated by this fact, this paper presents pathways to extend the theoretical analysis of this removal scheme. We first provide an extension for a restricted class of scenarios programs for which tight bounds can be obtained, and then we provide a conservative bound on the probability of constraint violation that is valid for any scenario program and an arbitrary number of removed scenarios, which is, however, not tight.}

While learning-based control has the potential to yield superior performance in demanding applications, robustness to uncertainty remains an important challenge. Since Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty of the learning results, it is natural to incorporate these uncertainties in a robust design. In contrast to most state-of-the-art approaches that consider worst-case estimates, we leverage the learning methodsâ posterior distribution in the controller synthesis. The result is a more informed and thus efficient trade-off between performance and robustness. We present a novel controller synthesis for linearized GP dynamics that yields robust controllers with respect to a probabilistic stability margin. The formulation is based on a recently proposed algorithm for linear quadratic control synthesis, which we extend by giving probabilistic robustness guarantees in the form of credibility bounds for the systemâs stability. Comparisons to existing methods based on worst-case and certainty-equivalence designs reveal superior performance and robustness properties of the proposed method.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper focuses on finding reinforcement learning policies for control systems with hard state and action constraints. Despite its success in many domains, reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard constraints, especially if both the state variables and actions are constrained. Previous works seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or safety, have focused on adding a projection step to the policy during learning. Yet, this approach requires solving an optimization problem at every policy execution step, which can lead to significant computational costs and has no safety guarantee with the projection step removed after training. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex Networks (VNs), with guarantees on safety during both the exploration and execution stage, by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy network architecture. Leveraging the geometric property that all points within a convex set can be represented as the convex combination of its vertices, the proposed algorithm first learns the convex combination weights and then uses these weights along with the pre-calculated vertices to output an action. The output action is guaranteed to be safe by construction. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms projection-based reinforcement learning methods.}

We construct compact topological representations to capture the state of highly deformable objects that are topologically nontrivial. We develop an approach that tracks the evolution of this topological state through time. Under several mild assumptions, we prove that the topology of the scene and its evolution can be recovered from point clouds representing the scene. Our further contribution is a method to learn predictive models that take a sequence of past point cloud observations as input and predict a sequence of topological states, conditioned on target/future control actions. Our experiments with highly deformable objects in simulation show that the proposed multistep predictive models yield more precise results that those obtained from computational topology libraries. These models can leverage patterns inferred across various objects and offer fast multistep predictions suitable for real-time applications.}

  abstract = 	 {How can we learn a dynamical system to make forecasts, when some variables are unobserved? For instance, in COVID-19, we want to forecast the number of infected patients and death cases but we do not know the count of susceptible and exposed people. How to proceed? While mechanics compartment models are widely-used in epidemic modeling, data-driven models are emerging for disease forecasting. As a case study, we compare these two types of models for COVID-19 forecasting and notice that physics-based models significantly outperform deep learning models. We present a hybrid approach, AutoODE-COVID, which combines a novel compartmental model with automatic differentiation.  Our method obtains a 57.4% reduction in mean absolute errors of the 7-day ahead COVID-19 trajectories prediction compared with the best deep learning competitor. To understand the inferior performance of deep learning, we investigate the generalization problem in forecasting. Through systematic experiments, we found that deep learning models fail to forecast under shifted distributions either in the data and parameter domains of dynamical systems.  This calls attention to rethink generalization especially for learning dynamical systems.}

  abstract = 	 { Value iteration (VI) is a ubiquitous algorithm for optimal control, planning, and reinforcement learning schemes. Under the right assumptions, VI is a vital tool to generate inputs with desirable properties for the controlled system, like optimality and Lyapunov stability. As VI usually requires an infinite number of iterations to solve general nonlinear optimal control problems, a key question is when to terminate the algorithm to produce a âgoodâ solution, with a measurable impact on optimality and stability guarantees. By carefully analysing VI under general stabilizability and detectability properties, we provide explicit and novel relationships of the stopping criterionâs impact on near-optimality, stability and performance, thus allowing to tune these desirable properties against the induced computational cost. The considered class of stopping criteria encompasses those encountered in the control, dynamic programming and reinforcement learning literature and it allows considering new ones, which may be useful to further reduce the computational cost while endowing and satisfying stability and near-optimality properties. We therefore lay a foundation to endow machine learning schemes based on VI with stability and performance guarantees, while reducing computational complexity.}

Motivated by these difficulties, in this paper we propose an optimization based approach to  learning  Koopman operators from data.

The system comprises multiple agents, each agent with a locally observed set of data points, and a common server with whom the agents can interact. The agentsâ goal is to compute a linear model that best fits the collective data points observed by all the agents. In the server-based distributed settings, the server cannot access the data points held by the agents. The recently proposed Iteratively Pre-conditioned Gradient-descent (IPG) method has been shown to converge faster than other existing distributed algorithms that solve this problem. In the IPG algorithm, the server and the agents perform numerous iterative computations. Each of these iterations relies on the entire batch of data points observed by the agents for updating the current estimate of the solution. Here, we extend the idea of iterative pre-conditioning to the stochastic settings, where the server updates the estimate and the iterative pre-conditioning matrix based on a single randomly selected data point at every iteration. We show that our proposed Iteratively Pre-conditioned Stochastic Gradient-descent (IPSG) method converges linearly in expectation to a proximity of the solution. Importantly, we empirically show that the proposed IPSG methodâs convergence rate compares favorably to prominent stochastic algorithms for solving the linear least-squares problem in server-based networks.}

However, in practice, the controller must guarantee some notion of safety to ensure that it does not harm either the agent or the environment. Stability is a crucial notion of safety, whose violation can certainly cause unsafe behaviors. Lyapunov functions are effective tools to assess stability in nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we combine an improving Lyapunov function with automatic controller synthesis in an iterative fashion to obtain control policies with large safe regions. We propose a two-player collaborative algorithm that alternates between estimating a Lyapunov function and deriving a controller that gradually enlarges the stability region of the closed-loop system. We provide theoretical results on the class of systems that can be treated with the proposed algorithm and empirically evaluate the effectiveness of our method using an exemplary dynamical system.}

The robot receives 6D poses of the objects along with their semantic labels, and executes nonprehensile actions on them. The robot does not receive any feedback regarding the task until the end of an episode, where a binary reward indicates success or failure in performing the task. Moreover, certain attributes of objects cannot be always observed, so the robot needs to learn to remember pertinent past actions that it executed. We propose to solve this problem by simultaneously learning a low-level control policy and a high-level finite-state task machine that keeps track of the progress made by the robot in solving the various sub-tasks and guides the low-level policy. Several experiments in simulation clearly show that the proposed approach is efficient at solving complex robotic tasks without any supervision.}

In our framework, the state of the system is required to stay within a given safety region under the (possibly repeated) action of all dynamical systems that are consistent with the information gathered so far.  For our first two results, we consider the setting of safely learning linear dynamics.  We present a linear programming-based algorithm that either safely recovers the true dynamics from trajectories of length one, or certifies that safe learning is impossible.  We also give an efficient semidefinite representation of the set of initial conditions whose resulting trajectories of length two are guaranteed to stay in the safety region.  For our final result, we study the problem of safely learning a nonlinear dynamical system. We give a second-order cone programming based representation of the set of initial conditions that are guaranteed to remain in the safety region after one application of the system dynamics. }

  abstract = 	 {Growing demands in the semiconductor industry result in the need for enhanced performance of lithographic equipment. However, position tracking accuracy of high precision mechatronics is often limited by the presence of disturbance sources, which originate from unmodelled or unforeseen deterministic environmental effects. To negate the effects of these disturbances, a learning based feedforward controller is employed, where the underlying control policy is estimated from experimental data based on Gaussian Process regression. The proposed approach exploits the property of including prior knowledge on the expected steady state behaviour of residual dynamics in terms of kernel selection. Corresponding hyper-parameters are optimized using the maximization of the marginalized likelihood. Consequently, the learned function is employed as augmentation of the currently employed rigid body feedforward controller. The effectiveness of the augmentation is experimentally validated on a magnetically levitated planar motor stage. The results of this paper highlight the benefits and possibilities of machine-learning based approaches for compensation of static effects, which originate from residual dynamics, such that  position tracking performance for moving-magnet planar motor actuators is improved.}

This is achieved using a robust synthesis procedure, where we first estimate a model from a single input-output trajectory of finite length, identify an H-infinity bound on the estimation error, and then design a robust controller using the estimated model and its quantified uncertainty. Our synthesis procedure leverages a recent control tool called Input-Output Parameterization (IOP) that enables robust controller design using convex optimization. For open-loop stable systems, we prove that the LQG performance degrades linearly with respect to the model estimation error using the proposed synthesis procedure. Despite the hidden states in the LQG problem, the achieved scaling matches previous results on learning Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controllers with full state observations.}

  abstract = 	 {  We study the infinite-horizon zero-sum linear quadratic (LQ) games, where the state transition is linear and the cost function is quadratic in states and actions of two players. In particular, we develop an adaptive algorithm that can properly trade off between exploration and exploitation of the unknown environment in LQ games based on the optimism-in-face-of-uncertainty (OFU) principle. We show that (i) the average regret of player $1$ (the min player) can be bounded by $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ against any fixed linear policy of the adversary (player $2$); (ii) the average cost of player $1$ also converges to the value of the game at a sublinear  $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate if the adversary plays adaptively against player $1$ with the same algorithm, i.e., with self-play. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a probably sample efficient reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for zero-sum LQ games.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper revisits the classical Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control from a modern optimization perspective. We analyze two aspects of the optimization landscape of the LQG problem: 1) connectivity of the set of stabilizing controllers $\mathcal{C}_n$; and 2) structure of stationary points.  It is known that similarity transformations do not change the input-output behavior of a dynamical controller or LQG cost. This inherent symmetry by similarity transformations makes the landscape of LQG very rich. We show that 1) the set of stabilizing controllers $\mathcal{C}_n$ has at most two path-connected components and they are diffeomorphic under a mapping defined by a similarity transformation; 2) there might exist many \emph{strictly suboptimal stationary points} of the LQG cost function over $\mathcal{C}_n$ and these stationary points are always \emph{non-minimal}; 3) all \emph{minimal} stationary points are globally optimal and they are identical up to a similarity transformation. These results shed some light on the performance analysis of direct policy gradient methods for solving the LQG problem.}

Dynamics model learning tends to focus on continuous motion, yielding poor results when deployed on real systems exposed to non-smooth frictional discontinuities. Inspired by a recent promising direction in machine learning, in this work we present a novel method for learning dynamics models undergoing contact by augmenting data-driven deep models with physics-penalised regularisation. Precisely, this paper conceptually formalises a novel framework for using an impenetrability component in the physics-based loss function directly within the learning objective of neural networks. Our results demonstrate that our method shows superior performance to using normal deep models for learning non-smooth dynamics models of robotic manipulators, strengthening their potential for deployment in contact-rich environments.}

  abstract = 	 {High order momentum-based parameter update algorithms have seen widespread applications in training machine learning models. Recently, connections with variational approaches have led to the derivation of new learning algorithms with accelerated learning guarantees. Such methods however, have only considered the case of static regressors. There is a significant need for parameter update algorithms which can be proven stable in the presence of adversarial time-varying regressors, as is commonplace in control theory. In this paper, we propose a new discrete time algorithm which 1) provides stability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial regressors by leveraging insights from \emph{adaptive control theory} and 2) provides non-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex optimization. In particular, our algorithm reaches an $\epsilon$ sub-optimal point in at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations when regressors are constant - matching lower bounds due to Nesterov of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$, up to a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor and provides guaranteed bounds for stability when regressors are time-varying. We provide numerical experiments for a variant of Nesterovâs provably hard convex optimization problem with time-varying regressors, as well as the problem of recovering an image with a time-varying blur and noise using streaming data.}

  abstract = 	 {In many computational tasks and dynamical systems, asynchrony and randomization are naturally present and have been considered as ways to increase the speed and reduce the cost of computation while compromising the accuracy and convergence rate. In this work, we show the additional benefits of randomization and asynchrony on the stability of linear dynamical systems. We introduce a natural model for random asynchronous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems which generalizes the standard (synchronous) LTI systems. In this model, each state variable is updated randomly and asynchronously with some probability according to the underlying system dynamics. We examine how the mean-square stability of random asynchronous LTI systems vary with respect to randomization and asynchrony. Surprisingly, we show that the stability of random asynchronous LTI systems does not imply or is not implied by the stability of the synchronous variant of the system and an unstable synchronous system can be stabilized via randomization and/or asynchrony. We further study a special case of the introduced model, namely randomized LTI systems, where each state element is updated randomly with some fixed but unknown probability. We consider the problem of system identification of unknown randomized LTI systems using the precise characterization of mean-square stability via extended Lyapunov equation. For unknown randomized LTI systems, we propose a systematic identification method to recover the underlying dynamics. Given a single input/output trajectory, our method estimates the model parameters that govern the system dynamics, the update probability of state variables, and the noise covariance using the correlation matrices of collected data and the extended Lyapunov equation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method consistently recovers the underlying system dynamics with optimal rate.}

When the system is unknown, robust approaches are promising since they aim to stabilize a large set of plausible systems simultaneously. We study linear controllers under quadratic costs model also known as linear quadratic regulators (LQR). We present two different semi-definite programs (SDP) which results in a controller that stabilizes all systems within an ellipsoid uncertainty set. We further show that the feasibility conditions of the proposed SDPs are \emph{equivalent}. Using the derived robust controller syntheses, we propose an efficient data dependent algorithm â \textsc{eXploration} â that with high probability quickly identifies a stabilizing controller. Our approach can be used to initialize existing algorithms that require a stabilizing controller as an input while adding constant to the regret. We further propose different heuristics which empirically reduce the number of steps taken by \textsc{eXploration} and reduce the suffered cost while searching for a stabilizing controller.}

This paper proposes a hybrid reinforcement learning controller which dynamically interpolates a model-based linear controller and an arbitrary differentiable policy. The linear controller is designed based on local linearised model knowledge, and stabilises the system in a neighbourhood about an operating point. The coefficients of interpolation between the two controllers are determined by a scaled distance function measuring the distance between the current state and the operating point. The overall hybrid controller is proven to maintain the stability guarantee around the neighborhood of the operating point and still possess the universal function approximation property of the arbitrary non-linear policy. Learning has been done on both model-based (PILCO) and model-free (DDPG) frameworks. Simulation experiments performed in OpenAI gym demonstrate stability and robustness of the proposed hybrid controller. This paper thus introduces a principled method allowing for the direct importing of control methodology into reinforcement learning.}

We formulate it as a discrete-time infinite-horizon LQR problem with a state predictive variance constraint. Since its optimal policy is known as an affine feedback, i.e., $u^* = -Kx+l$, we alternatively optimize the gain pair $(K,l)$ by designing a primal-dual learning algorithm. First, we observe that the Lagrangian function enjoys an important local gradient dominance property. Based on it, we then show that there is no duality gap despite the non-convex optimization landscape. Furthermore, we propose a primal-dual algorithm with global convergence to learn the optimal policy-multiplier pair. Finally, we validate our results via simulations.}

The goal of the robot is to safely collect observations on the disturbance and construct an accurate estimate of the underlying function.

Furthermore, we use neural contraction metrics to derive a tracking controller and the corresponding high-confidence uncertainty tube around the nominal trajectory planned for the robot, based on the estimate of the disturbance.

  abstract = 	 {Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) algorithms can attain significant sample efficiency but require an appropriate network structure to represent system dynamics. Current approaches include white-box modeling using analytic parameterizations and black-box modeling using deep neural networks. However, both can suffer from a bias-variance trade-off in the learning process, and neither provides a structured method for injecting domain knowledge into the network. As an alternative, gray-box modeling leverages prior knowledge in neural network training but only for simple systems. In this paper, we devise a nested mixture of experts (NMOE) for representing and learning hybrid dynamical systems. An NMOE combines both white-box and black-box models while optimizing bias-variance trade-off. Moreover, an NMOE provides a structured method for incorporating various types of prior knowledge by training the associative experts cooperatively or competitively. The prior knowledge includes information on robotsâ physical contacts with the environments as well as their kinematic and dynamic properties. In this paper, we demonstrate how to incorporate prior knowledge into our NMOE in various continuous control domains, including hybrid dynamical systems. We also show the effectiveness of our method in terms of data-efficiency, generalization to unseen data, and bias-variance trade-off. Finally, we evaluate our NMOE using an MBRL setup, where the model is integrated with a model-based controller and trained online.}

  abstract = 	 {In this paper, we consider a transfer Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem in continuous state and action spaces, under unobserved contextual information. The context here can represent a specific unique mental view of the world that an expert agent has formed through past interactions with this world. We assume that this context is not accessible to a learner agent who can only observe the expert data and does not know how they were generated. Then, our goal is to use the context-aware continuous expert data to learn an optimal context-unaware policy for the learner using only a few new data samples. To this date, such problems are typically solved using imitation learning that assumes that both the expert and learner agents have access to the same information. However, if the learner does not know the expert context, using the expert data alone will result in a biased learner policy and will require many new data samples to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, we formulate the learning problem that the learner agent solves as a causal bound-constrained Multi-Armed-Bandit (MAB) problem. The arms of this MAB correspond to a set of basis policy functions that can be initialized in an unsupervised way using the expert data and represent the different expert behaviors affected by the unobserved context. On the other hand, the MAB constraints correspond to causal bounds on the accumulated rewards of these basis policy functions that we also compute from the expert data. The solution to this MAB allows the learner agent to select the best basis policy and improve it online. And the use of causal bounds reduces the exploration variance and, therefore, improves the learning rate. We provide numerical experiments on an autonomous driving example that show that our proposed transfer RL method improves the learnerâs policy faster compared to imitation learning methods and enjoys much lower variance during training.}

  abstract = 	 {The  Reward-Biased  Maximum  Likelihood  Estimate  (RBMLE)  for  adaptive  control  of  Markov chains was proposed in (Kumar and Becker, 1982) to overcome the central obstacle of what is variously called the fundamental âclosed-identifiability problemâ of adaptive control (Borkar and Varaiya, 1979), the âdual control problemâ by Feldbaum (Feldbaum, 1960a,b), or, contemporaneously, the âexploration vs. exploitation problemâ. It exploited the key observation that since the maximum likelihood parameter estimator can asymptotically identify the closed-transition probabilities under a certainty equivalent approach (Borkar and Varaiya, 1979), the limiting parameter estimates must necessarily have an optimal reward that is less than the optimal reward attainable for the true but unknown system. Hence it proposed a counteracting reverse bias in favor of parameters with larger optimal rewards, providing a carefully structured solution to the fundamental problem alluded to above. It thereby proposed an optimistic approach of favoring parameters with larger optimal rewards, now known as âoptimism in the face of uncertainty.â The RBMLE approach has been proved to be long-term average reward optimal in a variety of contexts including controlled Markov chains, linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, some nonlinear systems, and diffusions.  However, modern attention is focused on the much finer notion of âregret,â or finite-time performance for all time, espoused by (Lai and Robbins, 1985).  Recent analysis of RBMLE for multi-armed stochastic bandits (Liu et al., 2020) and linear contextual bandits (Hung et al., 2020) has shown that it not only has state-of-the-art regret, but it also exhibits empirical performance comparable to or better than the best current contenders, and leads to several new and strikingly simple index policies for these classical problems. Motivated by this, we examine the finite-time performance of RBMLE for reinforcement learning tasks that involve the general problem of optimal control of unknown Markov Decision Processes. We show that it has a regret of O(log T ) over a time horizon of T, similar to state-of-art algorithms.}

The approach neither requires feature extraction, nor object detection, nor visual correspondence. The control policy does not involve the estimation of states or similar latent representations. Instead, tracking is achieved directly in image space, with a model of the reference signal embedded as required by the internal model principle. The reference signal is generated by a neural network with learning-based scene view synthesis capabilities. Our approach does not require an end-to-end learning of a pixel-to-action control policy. The approach is applied to a motion control problem, namely the longitudinal dynamics of a car-following problem. We show how this approach lend itself to a tractable stability analysis with associated bounds critical to establishing trustworthiness and interpretability of the closed-loop dynamics.}

In this paper, we propose a convex program, in the form of a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI), to certify quadratic bounds on the map of neural networks over a region of interest. These certificates can capture several useful properties such as (local) Lipschitz continuity, one-sided Lipschitz continuity, invertibility, and contraction. We illustrate the utility of our approach in two different settings. First, we develop a semidefinite program to compute guaranteed and sharp upper bounds on the local Lipschitz constant of neural networks and illustrate the results on random networks as well as networks trained on MNIST. Second, we consider a linear time-invariant system in feedback with an approximate model predictive controller given by a neural network. We then turn the stability analysis into a semidefinite feasibility program and estimate an ellipsoidal invariant set for the closed-loop system.}

We assume the attacker learns the dynamics of the system from observations, then  overrides the controllerâs actuation signal, while mimicking legitimate operation by providing fictitious sensor readings  to the controller.  On the other hand, the controller is  on a lookout to detect the presence of the attacker and tries to  enhance the detection performance by carefully crafting its control signals.  We study the trade-offs between    the information acquired by the attacker from observations,  the detection capabilities of the controller, and the control cost. Specifically, we provide  tight upper and lower bounds on the expected $\epsilon$-deception time, namely the time required by the controller to make a decision regarding the presence of an attacker with confidence at least $(1-\epsilon\log(1/\epsilon))$.  We then show a probabilistic lower bound  on the time that must be spent by the attacker learning the system, in order for the controller to have a given expected $\epsilon$-deception time. We show that this bound is also order optimal, in the sense that   if the attacker satisfies it, then there exists a learning algorithm with the given order expected deception time. Finally, we show a lower bound on the expected energy expenditure required to guarantee detection with confidence at least $1-\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon)$.}

Explicit upper and lower bounds on the optimal value function are stated and a simple formula for an adaptive controller achieving the upper bound is given.

In this paper, we shed light on the key objects involved in learning control constraints from data in a model-free setting. In particular, we discuss the family of constraints that enforce safety in the context of a nominal control policy, and expose that these constraints do not need to be accurate everywhere. They only need to correctly exclude a subset of the state-actions that would cause failure, which we call the critical set.}

The Linear Antisymmetric RNN (LARNN) is a previously suggested recurrent layer which is proven to ensure long-term memory using a simple structure without gating. The LARNN is based on an ordinary differential equation which is solved using numerical methods with a defined step size variable. In this paper, this step size is related to the sampling frequency of the data used for training and testing of the models. In particular, industrial datasets often consist of measurements that are sampled and analyzed manually or sampled only for sufficiently large change. This is usually handled by resampling and performing some kind of interpolation to gain a dataset with evenly sampled data. However, in doing so, one has to apply several assumption regarding the nature of the data (e.g. linear interpolation) and valuable information about the dynamics captured by the actual sampling is lost. Furthermore, interpolation is non-causal by nature, and thus poses a challenge in an online setting as future values are not known. By using information about sampling time in the LARNN structure, interpolation is obsolete as the model decouples the dynamics of the sampled system from the sampling regime. Furthermore, the suggested structure enables predictions related to specific times in the future, resulting in updated predictions regardless of whether new measurements are available. The performance of the LARNN is compared to an LSTM on a simulated industrial benchmark system.}

Specifically, we ask: to what extent are quantifiable control and perceptual difficulty metrics of a control task predictive of the performance of various families of data-driven controllers? We modulate two different types of partial observability in a cartpole âstick-balancingâ problem â the height of one visible fixation point on the cartpole, which can be used to tune fundamental limits of performance achievable by any controller, and by using depth or RGB image observations of the scene, we add different levels of perception noise without affecting system dynamics. In these settings, we empirically study two popular families of controllers: RL and system identification-based $H_\infty$ control, using visually estimated system state. Our results show the fundamental limits of robust control have corresponding implications for the sample-efficiency and performance of learned perception-based controllers.}

  abstract = 	 {Autoregressive exogenous (ARX) systems are the general class of input-output dynamical system used for modeling stochastic linear dynamical system (LDS) including partially observable LDS such as LQG systems. In this work, we study the problem of system identification and adaptive control of unknown ARX systems. We provide finite-time learning guarantees for the ARX systems under both open-loop and closed-loop data collection. Using these guarantees, we design adaptive control algorithms for unknown ARX systems with arbitrary strongly convex or non-strongly convex quadratic regulating costs. Under strongly convex cost functions, we design an adaptive control algorithm based on online gradient descent to design and update the controllers that are constructed via a convex controller reparametrization. We show that our algorithm has $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret via explore and commit approach and if the model estimates are updated in epochs using closed-loop data collection, it attains the optimal regret of $\text{polylog}(T)$ after $T$ time-steps of interaction. For the case of non-strongly convex quadratic cost functions, we propose an adaptive control algorithm that deploys the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle to design the controller. In this setting, we show that the explore and commit approach has a regret upper bound of $\Tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, and the adaptive control with continuous model estimate updates attains $\Tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$ time-steps.  }

However, in the absence of complete prior knowledge of a dynamical systemâs physical characteristics, determining the optimal structure and optimization strategy for these models can be difficult. In this work, we explore methods for discovering neural state space dynamics models for system identification. Starting with a design space of block-oriented state space models and structured linear maps with strong physical priors, we encode these components into a model genome alongside network structure, penalty constraints, and optimization hyperparameters. Demonstrating the overall utility of the design space, we employ an asynchronous genetic search algorithm that alternates between model selection and optimization and obtains accurate physically consistent models of three physical systems: an aerodynamics body, a continuous stirred tank reactor, and a two tank interacting system.}

We consider a feedback interconnection using a neural network controller in connection with an integrator, which allows for offset-free tracking of a desired piecewise constant reference that enters the controller as an external input. The feedback interconnection considered in this paper allows for general configurations of the neural network controller that include the special cases of output error and state feedback. Exploiting the fact that activation functions used in neural networks are slope-restricted, we derive linear matrix inequalities to verify stability using Lyapunov theory. After stating a global stability result, we present less conservative local stability conditions (i) for a given reference and (ii) for any reference from a certain set. The latter result even enables guaranteed tracking under setpoint changes using a reference governor which can lead to a significant increase of the region of attraction. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our analysis by verifying stability and offset-free tracking of a neural network controller that was trained to stabilize an inverted pendulum.}

This signal matrix model is derived by maximum likelihood estimation with noise-corrupted data. By linearizing online, the implicit model can be used as a linear constraint to characterize possible trajectories of the system in receding horizon control. The signal matrix can also be updated online with new measurements. This algorithm can be applied to large datasets and slowly time-varying systems, possibly with high noise levels. An additional regularization term on the prediction error can be introduced to enhance the predictability and thus the control performance.

The objective is to choose the set and the initial configuration of the objects, in order to get the ball to reach a target flag.  The presence of obstacles, friction, contact forces and combinatorial object choices make the game hard to solve. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical predictive framework which solves Bubble Ball. Geometric, kinematic and dynamic models are used at different levels of the hierarchy. At each level of the game, data collected during failed iterations are used to update models at all hierarchical level and converge to a feasible solution to the game. The proposed approach successfully solves a large set of Bubble Ball levels within reason-able number of trials. This proposed framework can also be used to solve other physics-based games, especially with limited training data from human demonstrations.}

We also demonstrate that the algorithm can be approximately implemented without knowledge of the dynamics model by using least-squares estimates of the state-action value function from trajectory data, from which policy improvements can be obtained. With sufficient trajectory data, the policy iterates converge cubically to approximately optimal policies, and this occurs with  the  same  available  sample  budget  as  the  approximate standard policy iteration. Numerical experiments demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}

Several lines of work have attempted to leverage trajectory optimization to learn value function approximations, usually by solving a large number of trajectory optimization problems as a means to generate training data. Even though these methods point to a promising direction, for sufficiently complex tasks, their sampling requirements can become computationally intractable. In this work, we leverage insights from adversarial learning in order to improve the sampling efficiency of a simple value function learning algorithm. We demonstrate how generating adversarial samples for this task presents a unique challenge due to the loss function that does not admit a closed form expression of the samples, but that instead requires the solution to a nonlinear optimization problem. Our key insight is that by leveraging duality theory from optimization, it is still possible to compute adversarial samples for this learning problem with virtually no computational overhead, including without having to keep track of shifting distributions of approximation errors or having to train generative models. We apply our method, named SEAGuL, to a canonical control task (balancing the acrobot) and a more challenging and highly dynamic nonlinear control task (the perching of a small glider). We demonstrate that compared to random sampling, with the same number of samples, training value function approximations using SEAGuL leads to improved generalization errors that also translate to control performance improvement.}

We propose a novel domain adaptation method to reduce the amount of training data needed for model-based reinforcement learning methods to train policies for a target system. Using our method, the required amount of target system training data can be reduced by collecting data on a proxy system with similar, but not identical, dynamics on which training data is cheaper to collect. Our method models the underlying dynamics shared between the two systems using a System Invariant Dynamics Model (SIDM), and models each systemâs relationship to the SIDM using encoders and decoders. When only limited amounts of target system training data is available, using target and proxy data to train the SIDM, encoders, and decoders can lead to more accurate dynamics models for the target system than using target system data alone. We demonstrate this approach using simulated wheeled robots driving over rough terrain, varying dynamics parameters between the target and proxy system, and find a reduction of 5-20x in the amount of data needed for these systems.}

This elicits a problem with how much inductive bias to impose on the model through known physical parameters and principles to reduce complexity of the learning problem to give us more reliable predictions. Recent work employs discrete variational integrators parameterized as a neural network architecture to learn conservative Lagrangian systems. The learned model captures and enforces global energy preserving properties of the system from very few trajectories. However, most real systems are inherently non-conservative and, in practice, we would also like to apply actuation. In this paper we extend this paradigm to account for general forcing (e.g. control input and friction) via discrete DâAlembertâs principle which may ultimately be used for control applications. We show that this forced variational integrator networks (FVIN) architecture allows us to accurately account for energy dissipation and external forcing while still capturing the true underlying energy-based passive dynamics. We show that in application this can result in highly-data efficient model-based control and can predict on real non-conservative systems.}

Offline RL enables extensive utilization and re-use of historical datasets, while also alleviating safety concerns associated with online exploration, thereby expanding the real-world applicability of RL. Most prior work in offline RL has focused on tasks with compact state representations. However, the ability to learn directly from rich observation spaces like images is critical for real-world applications like robotics. In this work, we build on recent advances in model-based algorithms for offline RL, and extend them to high-dimensional visual observation spaces. Model-based offline RL algorithms have achieved state of the art results in state based tasks and are minimax optimal. However, they rely crucially on the ability to quantify uncertainty in the model predictions. This is particularly challenging with image observations. To overcome this challenge, we propose to learn a latent-state dynamics model, and represent the uncertainty in the latent space. Our approach is both tractable in practice and corresponds to maximizing a lower bound of the ELBO in the unknown POMDP. Through experiments on a range of challenging image-based locomotion and robotic manipulation tasks, we find that our algorithm significantly outperforms previous offline model-free RL methods as well as state-of-the-art online visual model-based RL methods. Moreover, we also find that our approach excels on an image-based drawer closing task on a real robot using a pre-existing dataset.

  abstract = 	 {The problem of adaptive sampling for estimating probability mass functions (pmf) uniformly well is considered. Performance of the sampling strategy is measured in terms of the worst-case mean squared error. A Bayesian variant of the existing upper confidence bound (UCB) based approaches is proposed. It is shown analytically that the performance of this Bayesian variant is no worse than the existing approaches. The posterior distribution on the pmfs in the Bayesian setting allows for a tighter computation of upper confidence bounds which leads to significant performance gains in practice. Using this approach, adaptive sampling protocols are proposed for estimating SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in various groups such as location and ethnicity. The effectiveness of this strategy is discussed using data obtained from a seroprevalence survey in Los Angeles county.}

  abstract = 	 {In this work we consider the identification of partially observed dynamical systems from a single trajectory of arbitrary input-output data. We propose a new optimization objective, derived as a MAP estimator of a certain posterior, that explicitly accounts for model, measurement, and parameter uncertainty. This algorithm identifies a linear time invariant model on a hidden latent space of pre-specified dimension. In contrast to Markov-parameter based least squares approaches, our algorithm can be applied to systems with arbitrary forcing and initial conditions, and we empirically show several magnitude improvement in prediction quality compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both linear and nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we theoretically demonstrate how these existing approaches can be derived from simplifying assumptions on our system that neglect the possibility of model errors.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of generating maximally adversarial disturbances for a given controller assuming only blackbox access to it. We propose an online learning approach to this problem that adaptively generates disturbances based on control inputs chosen by the controller. The goal of the disturbance generator is to minimize regret versus a benchmark disturbance-generating policy class, i.e., to maximize the cost incurred by the controller as well as possible compared to the best possible disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a benchmark policy class). In the setting where the dynamics are linear and the costs are quadratic, we formulate our problem as an online trust region (OTR) problem with memory and present a new online learning algorithm (MOTR) for this problem. We prove that this method competes with the best disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a rich class of benchmark policies that includes linear-dynamical disturbance generating policies). We demonstrate our approach on two simulated examples: (i) synthetically generated linear systems, and (ii) generating wind disturbances for the popular PX4 controller in the AirSim simulator. On these examples, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baseline approaches (including H-infinity disturbance generation and gradient-based methods).}

  abstract = 	 {Many robotics domains use some form of nonconvex model predictive control (MPC) for planning, which sets a reduced time horizon, performs trajectory optimization, and replans at every step. The actual task typically requires a much longer horizon than is computationally tractable, and is specified via a cost function that cumulates over that full horizon. For instance, an autonomous car may have a cost function that makes a desired trade-off between efficiency, safety risk, and obeying traffic laws. In this work, we challenge the common assumption that the cost we should specify for MPC should be the same as the ground truth cost for the task. We propose that, because MPC solvers have short horizons, suffer from local optima, and, importantly, fail to account for future replanning ability, in many tasks it could be beneficial to purposefully choose a different cost function for MPC to optimize: one that results in the MPC rollout to have low ground truth cost, rather than the MPC planned trajectory. We formalize this as an optimal cost design problem, and propose a zeroth-order optimization-based approach that enables us to design optimal costs for an MPC planning robot in continuous state and action MDPs. We test our approach in an autonomous driving domain where we find costs different from the ground truth that implicitly compensate for replanning, short horizon, and local minima issues. As an example, planning with vanilla MPC under the learned cost incentivizes the car to delay its decision until later, implicitly accounting for the fact that it will get more information in the future and be able to make a better decision.}

In particular, a growing volume of literature has been exploring ways to enforce energy conservation while using neural networks for learning dynamics from observed time-series data. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of the energy-conserving neural networks - for example, deep Lagrangian network, Hamiltonian neural network, etc. - wherein the underlying physics is encoded in their computation graph. We focus on ten neural network models and explain the similarities and differences between the models. We compare their performance in 4 different physical systems. Our result highlights that using a high-dimensional coordinate system and then imposing restrictions via explicit constraints can lead to higher accuracy in the learned dynamics. We also point out the possibility of leveraging some of these energy-conserving models to design energy-based controllers. }

  abstract = 	 {It is challenging for humans â particularly people living with physical disabilities â to control high-dimensional and dexterous robots. Prior work explores how robots can learn embedding functions that map a humanâs low-dimensional inputs (e.g., via a joystick) to complex, high-dimensional robot actions for assistive teleoperation; unfortunately, there are many more high-dimensional actions than available low-dimensional inputs! To extract the correct action and maximally assist their human controller, robots must reason over their current context: for example, pressing a joystick right when interacting with a coffee cup indicates a different action than when interacting with food. In this work, we develop assistive robots that condition their latent embeddings on visual inputs. We explore a spectrum of plausible visual encoders and show that incorporating object detectors pretrained on a small amount of cheap and easy-to-collect structured data enables i) accurately and robustly recognizing the current context and ii) generalizing control embeddings to new objects and tasks. In user studies with a high-dimensional physical robot arm, participants leverage this approach to perform new tasks with unseen objects. Our results indicate that structured visual representations improves few-shot performance and is subjectively preferred by users.}

  abstract = 	 {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods provide state-of-art performance in complex control tasks. However, it has been widely recognized that RL methods often fail to generalize due to unaccounted uncertainties. In this work, we propose a game theoretic framework for robust reinforcement learning that comprises many previous works as special cases. We formulate robust RL as a constrained minimax game between the RL agent and an environmental agent which represents uncertainties such as model parameter variations and adversarial disturbances. To solve the competitive optimization problems arising in our framework, we propose to use competitive mirror descent (CMD). This method accounts for the interactive nature of the game at each iteration while using Bregman divergences to adapt to the global structure of the constraint set. We demonstrate an RRL policy gradient algorithm that leverages Lagrangian duality and CMD. We empirically show that our algorithm is stable for large step sizes, resulting in faster convergence on linear quadratic games. }

Unlike most prior work in this area, we focus on the problem of designing an online controller which competes with the optimal dynamic sequence of control actions selected in hindsight, instead of the best controller in some specic class of controllers. This formulation of regret is attractive when the environment changes over time and no single controller achieves good performance over the entire time horizon. We show that in the measurement-feedback setting, unlike in the full-information setting, there is no single oine controller which outperforms every other oine controller on every disturbance, and propose a new H2-optimal oine controller as a benchmark for the online controller to compete against. We show that the corresponding regret-optimal online controller can be found via a novel reduction to the classical Nehari problem from robust control and present a tight data-dependent bound on its regret.}
