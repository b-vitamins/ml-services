  abstract = 	 {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher-level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution $P(x)$ is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting $P(y|x)$. This paper focuses on the context of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution.}

In spite of their fundamental role, only linear autoencoders over the real numbers have been solved analytically. Here we present a general mathematical framework for the study of both linear and non-linear autoencoders. The framework allows one to derive an analytical treatment for the most non-linear autoencoder, the Boolean autoencoder. Learning in the Boolean autoencoder is equivalent to a clustering problem that can be solved in polynomial time when the number of clusters is small and becomes NP complete when the number of clusters is large. The framework sheds light on the different kinds of autoencoders, their learning complexity, their horizontal and vertical composability in deep architectures, their critical points, and their fundamental connections to clustering, Hebbian learning, and information theory.}

For data clustering, the patterns are object partitionings into k groups; for PCA or truncated SVD, the patterns are orthogonal transformations with projections to a low-dimensional space. We propose an information theoretic principle for model selection and model-order selection. Our principle ranks competing pattern cost functions according to their ability to extract context sensitive information from noisy data with respect to the chosen hypothesis class. Sets of approximative solutions serve as a basis for a communication protocol. Analogous to ?, inferred models maximize the so-called approximation capacity that is the mutual information between coarsened training data patterns and coarsened test data patterns. We demonstrate how to apply our validation framework by the well-known Gaussian mixture model and by a multi-label clustering approach for role mining in binary user privilege assignments.}

  abstract = 	 {A crucial issue in machine learning is how to learn appropriate representations for data. Recently, much work has been devoted to kernel learning, that is, the problem of finding a good kernel matrix for a given task. This can be done in a semi-supervised learning setting by using a large set of unlabeled data and a (typically small) set of i.i.d. labeled data. Another, even more challenging problem, is how one can exploit partially labeled data of a source task to learn good representations for a different, but related, target task. This is the main subject of transfer learning. In this paper, we present a novel approach to transfer learning based on kernel learning. Specifically, we propose a kernel meta-learning algorithm which, starting from a basic kernel, tries to learn chains of kernel transforms that are able to produce good kernel matrices for the source tasks. The same sequence of transformations can be then applied to compute the kernel matrix for new related target tasks. We report on the application of this method to the five datasets of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning (UTL) challenge benchmark, where we won the first phase of the competition.}

The strategy of our team won the final phase of the challenge. It combined and stacked different one-layer unsupervised learning algorithms, adapted to each of the five datasets of the competition.

To alleviate the overfitting problem, we also utilize a stochastic process to combine multiple clustering assignments on each data point.

Therefore, they are challenged by the mismatch between training and test distributions encountered in transfer learning situations. The problem is further exacerbated when the test data actually comes from a different domain and contains no labeled example. This paper describes an optimization framework that takes as input one or more classifiers learned on the source domain as well as the results of a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target domain, and yields a consensus labeling of the data in the target domain. This framework is fairly general in that it admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. Empirical results on both text and hyperspectral data indicate that the proposed method can yield superior classification results compared to applying certain other transductive and transfer learning techniques or naÄ±Ìvely applying the classifier (ensemble) learnt on the source domain to the target domain.}

A major challenge of detecting Wikipedia vandalism is the lack of a large amount of labeled training data. Knowledge transfer addresses this challenge by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from a source task. However, the characteristics of Wikipedia vandalism are heterogeneous, ranging from a small replacement of a letter to a massive deletion of text. Selecting an informative subset from the source task to avoid potential negative transfer becomes a primary concern given this heterogeneous nature. The paper explores knowledge transfer methods to generalize learned models from a heterogeneous dataset to a more uniform dataset while avoiding negative transfer. The two novel segmented transfer (ST) approaches map unlabeled data from the target task to the most related cluster from the source task, classifying the unlabeled data using the most relevant learned models.}

We extend this framework by incorporating a novel similarity measurement, which allows for the representation of much more complex data structures. The proposed framework also enables us to exploit additional information (e.g., the input-specific features) when constructing the covariance matrices by combining additional information with the covariance function. We also derive an efficient learning algorithm which uses an iterative method to make predictions. Finally, we apply our model to a real data set of recommender systems and show that the proposed method achieves the best prediction accuracy on the data set.}
