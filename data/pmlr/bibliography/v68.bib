  abstract = 	 {Logged events occur both regularly and irregularly over time. In electronic health records, these events represent mixtures of scheduled and urgent or emergent encounters. Whereas most survival models use baseline events to estimate the rate function for an outcome, e.g., Cox processes using the proportional-hazards assumption, our framework uses logged events over time to predict survival outcomes with piecewise approximations of arbitrary hazard functions. We develop a procedure to learn forests as combinations of piecewise-constant and parameterized distributions to compactly model survival distributions from data. Under this construction, the model provides a ânow-timeâ risk that incorporates irregularly-repeated data and for health outcomes serves as a surrogate for patient disposition. We illustrate the advantages of our method in simulations and in longitudinal, intensive care unit data of individuals with diabetes admitted for ketoacidosis.}

  abstract = 	 {Wearable technologies can benefit from compressive sensing (CS) as an efficient signal transformation, compression, and reconstruction technique. Among such technologies, in-shoe pressure monitoring systems are designed to continuously record plantar pressure distribution for various applications ranging from medical research to product development in sports and healthcare. To gather adequate information from plantar area, a high resolution spatial pressure reading is required. However, to achieve a practical wearable monitoring system with long battery life at a reasonable price, the number of sensors in the shoe must be very limited. In this paper, we employed CS principles to reconstruct spatially-continuous plantar pressure distribution from a small number of sensors (i.e. K < 10) based on a supervised dictionary learning approach. The learned dictionary transforms the high-resolution pressure distribution to a sparse representation which is accurately reconstructable using either orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) or least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. Using plantar pressure data from 5 participants, we demonstrated that our method outperforms grid-based and non-gridded interpolation techniques even at K = 4 sensors such that the best interpolation needs more than K = 170 sensors to give the same reconstruction accuracy. With K = 4 sensors, we achieved a root mean squares (RMS) reconstruction error of 6.7 kPa per sensing cell while the error remained below 16 kPa for pressure values up to 160 kPa. Our algorithm is also shown to be robust in presence of measurement error and limited training data, therefore efficiently addresses the challenges encountered in production of commercial in-shoe monitoring systems.}

Although many factors are known to be linked to this, much remains to be understood about their exact influence on outcome. In this study we used Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to predict long-term mortality in CABG patients using data from routinely measured clinical parameters from a large cohort of CABG patients (n=5868). We compared the accuracy of 5 different ML models with traditional Cox and Logistic Regression, and report the most important variables in the best performing models. In the validation dataset, the Gradient Boosted Machine (GBM) algorithm was the most accurate (AUROC curve [95%CI] of 0.767 [0.739-0.796]), proving to be superior to traditional Cox and logistic regression (p <0.01) for long-term mortality prediction. Measures of variable importance for outcome prediction extracted from the GBM and Random Forest models partly reflected what is known in the literature, but interestingly also highlighted other unexpectedly relevant parameters. In conclusion, we found ML algorithm-based models to be more accurate than traditional Logistic Regression in predicting long-term mortality after CABG. Finally, these models may provide essential input to assist the development of intelligent decision support systems for clinical use.}

We investigate neural regression algorithms to estimate the parameters of surgery case durations, focusing on the issue of heteroscedasticity. We seek to simultaneously estimate the duration of each surgery, as well as a surgery-specific notion of our uncertainty about its duration. Estimating this uncertainty can lead to more nuanced and effective scheduling strategies, as we are able to schedule surgeries more efficiently while allowing an informed and case-specific margin of error. Using surgery records from a large United States health system we demonstrate potential improvements on the order of 20% (in terms of minutes overbooked) compared to current scheduling techniques. Moreover, we demonstrate that surgery durations are indeed heteroscedastic. We show that models that estimate case-specific uncertainty better fit the data (log likelihood). Additionally, we show that the heteroscedastic predictions can more optimally trade off between over and under-booking minutes, especially when idle minutes and scheduling collisions confer disparate costs.}

Recently, the attention of the medical community toward the use of patient-centered outcomes in multiple sclerosis has significantly increased. Such patient-friendly measures are devoted to the assessment of the impact of the disease on several domains of the patient life. In this work, we investigate on use of patient-centered outcomes to predict the evolution of the disease and to assess its impact on patientsâ lives.

  abstract = 	 {Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) and costs hospitals billions annually. Treating a septic patient is highly challenging, because individual patients respond very differently to medical interventions and there is no universally agreed-upon treatment for sepsis. Understanding more about a patientâs physiological state at a given time could hold the key to effective treatment policies. In this work, we propose a new approach to deduce optimal treatment policies for septic patients by using continuous state-space models and deep reinforcement learning. Learning treatment policies over continuous state-spaces is important, because doing so allows us to retain more of the patientâs physiological information. Our model is able to learn clinically interpretable treatment policies, similar in important aspects to the treatment policies of physicians. Evaluating our algorithm on past ICU patient data, we find that our model could reduce absolute patient mortality in the hospital by up to 3.6% over observed clinical policies. The learned treatment policies could be used to aid intensive care clinicians in medical decision making and improve the likelihood of patient survival.}

We validate our model on ICU data to predict hemodynamic instability and present analyses on using the patient similarity function to construct personalized cohorts. Our experiments show that the statistical properties learned by the kernels functions based on feature population distributions are significantly more predictive than naive stationary kernels (e.g. RBFs).

These tests are subjective, time-consuming, and must be administered by a professional. This can be problematic where specialists are not available, or when a patient is not consistently evaluated by the same clinician. We present an automated method for quantifying the severity of motion impairment in patients with ataxia, using only video recordings. We consider videos of the finger-to-nose test, a common movement task used as part of the assessment of ataxia progression during the course of routine clinical checkups. Our method uses neural network-based pose estimation and optical flow techniques to track the motion of the patientâs hand in a video recording. We extract features that describe qualities of the motion such as speed and variation in performance. Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we train a supervised learning model that predicts severity according to the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). The performance of our system is comparable to that of a group of ataxia specialists in terms of mean error and correlation, and our systemâs predictions were consistently within the range of inter-rater variability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using computer vision and machine learning to produce consistent and clinically useful measures of motor impairment.}

  abstract = 	 {We develop a novel algorithm, Predictive Hierarchical Clustering (PHC), for agglomerative hierarchical clustering of current procedural terminology (CPT) codes. Our predictive hierarchical clustering aims to cluster subgroups, not individual observations, found within our data, such that the clusters discovered result in optimal performance of a classification model. Therefore, merges are chosen based on a Bayesian hypothesis test, which chooses pairings of the subgroups that result in the best model fit, as measured by held out predictive likelihoods. We place a Dirichlet prior on the probability of merging clusters, allowing us to adjust the size and sparsity of clusters. The motivation is to predict patient-specific surgical outcomes using data from ACS NSQIP (American College of Surgeonâs National Surgical Quality Improvement Program). An important predictor of surgical outcomes is the actual surgical procedure performed as described by a CPT code. We use PHC to cluster CPT codes, represented as subgroups, together in a way that enables us to better predict patient-specific outcomes compared to currently used clusters based on clinical judgment.}

  abstract = 	 {Sepsis is a poorly understood and potentially life-threatening complication that can occur as a result of infection. Early detection and treatmenz improves patient outcomes, and as such it poses an important challenge in medicine. In this work, we develop a flexible classifier that leverages streaming lab results, vitals, and medications to predict sepsis before it occurs. We model patient clinical time series with multi-output Gaussian processes, maintaining uncertainty about the physiological state of a patient while also imputing missing values. The mean function takes into account the effects of medications administered on the trajectories of the physiological variables. Latent function values from the Gaussian process are then fed into a deep recurrent neural network to classify patient encounters as septic or not, and the overall model is trained end-to-end using back-propagation. We train and validate our model on a large dataset of 18 months of heterogeneous inpatient stays from the Duke University Health System, and develop a new âreal-timeâ validation scheme for simulat-ing the performance of our model as it will actually be used. Our proposed method substantially outperforms clinical baselines, and improves on a previous related model for detecting sepsis. Our modelâs predictions will be displayed in a real-time analytics dashboard to be used by a sepsis rapid response team to help detect and improve treatment of sepsis.}

We focus on modeling the temporal dependencies that arise due to the types, timings, and values of different events in such data. We model the event streams, including vital signs, laboratory results contained in two different datasets (MIMIC III â Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care clinical database â and data extracted from EHRs of patients in a tertiary pediatric intensive care unit) using a piecewise-constant conditional intensity model (PCIM), a type of marked point process. Our experiments capture meaningful temporal dependencies and show improvement in hospital mortality prediction over traditional ICU scoring systems.}

  abstract = 	 {Clinical diagnostic inferencing is a complex task, which often requires significant medical research and investigation based on an underlying clinical scenario. This paper proposes a novel approach by formulating the task as a reinforcement learning problem such that the system can infer the most probable diagnoses by optimizing clinical concept extraction from a free text case narrative via leveraging relevant external evidence. Such a formulation is deemed to be suitable due to the inherent complexity of the task and unavailability of sufficient annotated data. During training, the agent tries to learn the optimal policy through iterative search and consolidation of the most relevant clinical concepts that best describe a correct diagnosis. A deep Q-network architecture is trained to optimize a reward function that measures the accuracy of the candidate diagnoses and clinical concepts. Our preliminary experiments on the TREC CDS dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our system over non-reinforcement learning-based strong baselines.}

  abstract = 	 {Access to electronic health record (EHR) data has motivated computational advances in medical research. However, various concerns, particularly over privacy, can limit access to and collaborative use of EHR data. Sharing synthetic EHR data could mitigate risk. In this paper, we propose a new approach, medical Generative Adversarial Network (medGAN), to generate realistic synthetic patient records. Based on input real patient records, medGAN can generate high-dimensional discrete variables (e.g., binary and count features) via a combination of an autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. We also propose minibatch averaging to efficiently avoid mode collapse, and increase the learning efficiency with batch normalization and shortcut connections. To demonstrate feasibility, we showed that medGAN generates synthetic patient records that achieve comparable performance to real data on many experiments including distribution statistics, predictive modeling tasks and a medical expert review. We also empirically observe a limited privacy risk in both identity and attribute disclosure using medGAN.}

  abstract = 	 {Mental illnesses adversely affect a significant proportion of the population worldwide. However, the typical methods to estimate and characterize the prevalence of mental health conditions are time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, best-available estimates concerning the prevalence of these conditions are often years out of date. Automated approaches that supplement traditional methods with broad, aggregated information derived from social media provide a potential means of furnishing near real-time estimates at scale. These may in turn provide grist for supporting, evaluating and iteratively improving public health programs and interventions. We propose a novel approach for mental health quantification that leverages user em-beddings induced from social media post histories. Recent work showed that learned user representations capture latent aspects of individuals (e.g., political leanings). This paper investigates whether these representations also correlate with mental health statuses. To this end, we induced embeddings for a set of users known to be affected by depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, and for a set of demographically matched âcontrolâ users. We then evaluated the induced user representations with respect to: (i) their ability to capture homophilic relations with respect to mental health statuses; and (ii) their predictive performance in downstream mental health models. Our experimental results demonstrate that learned user embeddings capture relevant signals for mental health quantification.}

This task is complicated by data sources that are sparse, noisy, heterogeneous and outcomes that are imbalanced. In this work, we integrate data across many ICU sources â vitals, labs, notes, demographics â and focus on learning rich representations of this data to predict onset and weaning of multiple invasive interventions. In particular, we compare both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner after a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of-the-art results on these predictive tasks using deep architectures. Further, we explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the interpretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines for intervention prediction, and provide insight into model learning.}

Understanding the mechanisms of ATC and how existing patient tests can inform us about these mechanisms is key to treating the disease. We introduce a hierarchical Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) model that captures a lower dimensional representation of the coagulation system based on blood protein and other tests. The hierarchial nature of the model is ideal in the setting where multiple sub-cohorts are present, but statistical strength can reasonably be borrowed from similar groups. We illustrate how the model may be useful in understanding and treating ATC.}

  abstract = 	 {Mortality prediction of intensive care unit (ICU) patients facilitates hospital benchmarking and has the opportunity to provide caregivers with useful summaries of patient health at the bedside. The development of novel models for mortality prediction is a popular task in machine learning, with researchers typically seeking to maximize measures such as the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). The number of âresearcher degrees of freedomâ that contribute to the performance of a model, however, presents a challenge when seeking to compare reported performance of such models. In this study, we review publications that have reported performance of mortality prediction models based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC) database and attempt to reproduce the cohorts used in their studies. We then compare the performance reported in the studies against gradient boosting and logistic regression models using a simple set of features extracted from MIMIC. We demonstrate the large heterogeneity in studies that purport to conduct the single task of âmortality predictionâ, highlighting the need for improvements in the way that prediction tasks are reported to enable fairer comparison between models. We reproduced datasets for 38 experiments corresponding to 28 published studies using MIMIC. In half of the experiments, the sample size we acquired was 25% greater or smaller than the sample size reported. The highest discrepancy was 11,767 patients. While accurate reproduction of each study cannot be guaranteed, we believe that these results highlight the need for more consistent reporting of model design and methodology to allow performance improvements to be compared. We discuss the challenges in reproducing the cohorts used in the studies, highlighting the importance of clearly reported methods (e.g. data cleansing, variable selection, cohort selection) and the need for open code and publicly available benchmarks.}
