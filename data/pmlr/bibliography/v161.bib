 abstract = {Deep learning architectures with a huge number of parameters are often compressed using pruning techniques to ensure computational efficiency of inference during deployment. Despite multitude of empirical advances, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of different pruning methods. We inspect different pruning techniques under the statistical mechanics formulation of a teacher-student framework and derive their generalization error (GE) bounds. It has been shown that Determinantal Point Process (DPP) based node pruning method is notably superior to competing approaches when tested on real datasets. Using GE bounds in the aforementioned setup we provide theoretical guarantees for their empirical observations. Another consistent finding in literature is that sparse neural networks (edge pruned) generalize better than dense neural networks (node pruned) for a fixed number of parameters. We use our theoretical setup to prove this finding and show that even the baseline random edge pruning method performs better than the DPP node pruning method. We also validate this empirically on real datasets.},

 abstract = {Identifying the preferences of a given user through elicitation is a central part of multi-criteria decision aid (MCDA) or preference learning tasks. Two classical ways to perform this elicitation is to use either a robust or a Bayesian approach. However, both have their shortcoming: the robust approach has strong guarantees through very strong hypotheses, but cannot integrate uncertain information. while the Bayesian approach can integrate uncertainties, but sacrifices the previous guarantees and asks for stronger model assumptions. In this paper, we propose and test a method based on possibility theory, which keeps the guarantees of the robust approach without needing its strong hypotheses. Among other things, we show that it can detect user errors as well as model misspecification.},

We introduce a novel objective function that simultaneously accounts for fairness and stability and develop a layer-wise weight normalization using the Lipschitz constant to enhance neural message passing in GNNs. In doing so, we enforce fairness and stability both in the objective function as well as in the GNN architecture. Further, we show theoretically that our layer-wise weight normalization promotes counterfactual fairness and stability in the resulting representations. We introduce three new graph datasets comprising of high-stakes decisions in criminal justice and financial lending domains.

 abstract = {People can learn new visual concepts without any samples, from information given by language or by deductive reasoning. For instance, people can use \textit{elimination} to infer the meaning of novel labels from their context. While recognizing novel concepts was intensively studied in zero-shot learning with semantic descriptions, training models to learn by elimination is much less studied. Here we describe the first approach to train an agent to reason-by-elimination, by providing instructions that contain both familiar concepts and unfamiliar ones ( ``pick the red box and the green wambim''). In our framework, the agent combines a perception module with a reasoning module that includes internal memory. It uses reinforcement learning to construct a reasoning policy that, by considering all available items in a room, can make a correct inference even for never-seen objects or concepts. Furthermore, it can then perform one-shot learning and use newly learned concepts for inferring additional novel concepts. We evaluate this approach in a new set of environments, showing that agents successfully learn to reason by elimination, and can also learn novel concepts and use them for further reasoning. This approach paves the way to handle open-world environments by extending the abundant supervised learning approaches with reasoning frameworks that can handle novel concepts.},

Although the problems of testing CI and estimating divergences have been extensively studied, the complementary problem of generating data that satisfies CI has received much less attention. Given samples from an input data distribution, we formulate the problem of generating samples from a distribution that is close to the input distribution and satisfies CI. We establish a general characterization of CI in terms of a divergence identity that holds for a large class of divergences satisfying separability and strict convexity properties. Based on the Jensen-Shannon version of this identity, an architecture is proposed that leverages the capabilities of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to enforce CI in an end-to-end differentiable manner. As one illustration of the problem formulation and architecture, we consider applications to notions of fairness that can be written as enforcing CIs. We demonstrate the generation of data to trade off adherence to fairness criteria against classification accuracy.},

 abstract = {A butterfly network consists of logarithmically many layers, each with a linear number of non-zero weights (pre-specified). The fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform (FJLT) can be represented as a butterfly network followed by a projection onto a random subset of the coordinates. Moreover, a random matrix based on FJLT with high probability approximates the action of any matrix on a vector. Motivated by these facts, we propose to replace a dense linear layer in any neural network by an architecture based on the butterfly network. The proposed architecture significantly improves upon the quadratic number of weights required in a standard dense layer to nearly linear with little compromise in expressibility of the resulting operator. In a collection of wide variety of experiments, including supervised prediction on both the NLP and vision data, we show that this not only produces results that match and at times outperform existing well-known architectures, but it also offers faster training and prediction in deployment. To understand the optimization problems posed by neural networks with a butterfly network, we also study the optimization landscape of the encoder-decoder network, where the encoder is replaced by a butterfly network followed by a dense linear layer in smaller dimension. Theoretical result presented in the paper explains why the training speed and outcome are not compromised by our proposed approach.},

Weak supervision provides an alternative to supervised learning by training with cheap, noisy, and possibly correlated labeling functions from varying sources. The key challenge in weakly supervised learning is combining the different weak supervision signals while navigating misleading correlations in their errors. In this paper, we propose a simple data-free approach for combining weak supervision signals by defining a constrained space for the possible labels of the weak signals and training with a random labeling within this constrained space. Our method is efficient and stable, converging after a few iterations of gradient descent. We prove theoretical conditions under which the worst-case error of the randomized label decreases with the rank of the linear constraints. We show experimentally that our method outperforms other weak supervision methods on various text- and image-classification tasks.},

We show that the simplest architecture change of gating each residual connection using a single zero-initialized parameter satisfies initial dynamical isometry and outperforms more complex approaches. Although much simpler than its predecessors, this gate enables training thousands of fully connected layers with fast convergence and better test performance for ResNets trained on CIFAR-10.

Traditionally, GNNs are trained on a semi-supervised or self-supervised loss function and then clustering algorithms are applied to detect communities. However, such decoupled approaches are inherently sub-optimal. Designing an unsupervised loss function to train a GNN and extract communities in an integrated manner is a fundamental challenge. To tackle this problem, we combine the principle of self-expressiveness with the framework of self-supervised graph neural network for unsupervised community detection for the first time in literature.

Particularly, we explore the latter in both deterministic and stochastic settings and develop tractable approximation methods in a near model-free setup.

These algorithms are often applied to datasets containing binary variables, which indicate the 'context' of the observations, e.g. a control or treatment group within an experiment. In these settings, conditional independence testing with $X$ or $Y$ binary (and the other continuous) is paramount to the performance of the causal discovery algorithm. To our knowledge no nonparametric 'mixed' conditional independence test currently exists, and in practice tests that assume all variables to be continuous are used instead. In this paper we aim to fill this gap, as we combine elements of Holmes et al. (2015) and Teymur and Filippi (2020) to propose a novel Bayesian nonparametric conditional two-sample test. Applied to the Local Causal Discovery algorithm, we investigate its performance on both synthetic and real-world data, and compare with state-of-the-art conditional independence tests.},

To mitigate issues with training, a recent work models the endpoints of these intervals using Gumbel distributions, chosen due to their min/max-stability. In this work we analyze min/max-stability on a bounded domain and provide a specific family of such distributions which, replacing Gumbel, allow for stochastic boxes embedded in a finite measure space. This allows for a latent noise model which is a probability measure. Furthermore, we demonstrate an equivalence between this region-based representation and a density representation, where intersection is given by products of densities. We compare our model to previous region-based probability models, and demonstrate it is capable of being trained effectively to modeling correlations.},

 abstract = {Existing studies indicate that momentum ideas in conventional optimization can be used to improve the performance of Q-learning algorithms. However, the finite-time analysis for momentum-based Q-learning algorithms is only available for the tabular case without function approximation. This paper analyzes a class of momentum-based Q-learning algorithms with finite-time convergence guarantee. Specifically, we propose the MomentumQ algorithm, which integrates the Nesterov's and Polyak's momentum schemes, and generalizes the existing momentum-based Q-learning algorithms. For the infinite state-action space case, we establish the convergence guarantee for MomentumQ with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling. In particular, we characterize a finite-time convergence rate which is provably faster than the vanilla Q-learning. This is the first finite-time analysis for momentum-based Q-learning algorithms with function approximation. For the tabular case under synchronous sampling, we also obtain a finite-time convergence rate that is slightly better than the SpeedyQ [Azar et al., 2011].},

 abstract = {Auxiliary particle filters (APFs) are a class of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods for Bayesian inference in state-space models. In their original derivation, APFs operate in an extended state space using an auxiliary variable to improve inference. In this work, we propose optimized auxiliary particle filters, a framework where the traditional APF auxiliary variables are interpreted as weights in an importance sampling mixture proposal. Under this interpretation, we devise a mechanism for proposing the mixture weights that is inspired by recent advances in multiple and adaptive importance sampling. In particular, we propose to select the mixture weights by formulating a convex optimization problem, with the aim of approximating the filtering posterior at each timestep. Further, we propose a weighting scheme that generalizes previous results on the APF (Pitt et al. 2012), proving unbiasedness and consistency of our estimators. Our framework demonstrates significantly improved estimates on a range of metrics compared to state-of-the-art particle filters at similar computational complexity in challenging and widely used dynamical models.},

 abstract = {We consider the weighted first-order model counting (WFOMC) task, a problem with important applications to inference and learning in structured graphical models. Bringing together earlier work [Van den Broeck et al., 2011, 2014], a formal proof was given by Beame et al. [2015] showing that the two-variable fragment of first-order logic, FO^2, is domain-liftable, meaning it admits an algorithm for WFOMC whose runtime is polynomial in the given domain size. However, applying this theoretical upper bound is often impractical for real-world problem instances. We show how to adapt their proof into a fast algorithm for lifted inference in FO^2, using only off-the-shelf tools for knowledge compilation, and several careful optimizations involving the cell graph of the input sentence, a novel construct we define that encodes the interactions between the cells of the sentence. Experimental results show that, despite our approach being largely orthogonal to that of Forclift [Van den Broeck et al., 2011], our algorithm often outperforms it, scaling to larger domain sizes on more complex input sentences.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of simultaneous learning in stochastic games with many players in the finite-horizon setting. While the typical target solution for a stochastic game is a Nash equilibrium, this is intractable with many players. We instead focus on variants of {\it correlated equilibria}, such as those studied for extensive-form games. We begin with a hardness result for the adversarial MDP problem: even for a horizon of 3, obtaining sublinear regret against the best non-stationary policy is \textsf{NP}-hard when both rewards and transitions are adversarial. This implies that convergence to even the weakest natural solution concept---normal-form coarse correlated equilbrium---is not possible via black-box reduction to a no-regret algorithm even in stochastic games with constant horizon (unless $\textsf{NP}\subseteq\textsf{BPP}$). Instead, we turn to a different target: algorithms which {\it generate} an equilibrium when they are used by all players. Our main result is algorithm which generates an {\it extensive-form} correlated equilibrium, whose runtime is exponential in the horizon but polynomial in all other parameters. We give a similar algorithm which is polynomial in all parameters for ``fast-mixing'' stochastic games. We also show a method for efficiently reaching normal-form coarse correlated equilibria in ``single-controller'' stochastic games which follows the traditional no-regret approach. When shared randomness is available, the two generative algorithms can be extended to give simultaneous regret bounds and converge in the traditional sense.},

CIFs do not possess a closed-form marginal density, and so, unlike standard flows, cannot be plugged in directly to a variational inference (VI) scheme in order to produce a more expressive family of approximate posteriors. However, we show here how CIFs can be used as part of an auxiliary VI scheme to formulate and train expressive posterior approximations in a natural way. We exploit the conditional independence structure of multi-layer CIFs to build the required auxiliary inference models, which we show empirically yield low-variance estimators of the model evidence. We then demonstrate the advantages of CIFs over baseline flows in VI problems when the posterior distribution of interest possesses a complicated topology, obtaining improved results in both the Bayesian inference and surrogate maximum likelihood settings.},

In the general case where (a) the reward function is non-linear, (b) arms may be probabilistically triggered, and (c) only approximate offline oracle exists \cite{wang2017improving}, our algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{\mathcal{S} T})$ distribution-dependent regret in the switching case, and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\mathcal{V}^{1/3}T^{2/3})$ in the dynamic case, where $\mathcal S$ is the number of switchings and $\mathcal V$ is the sum of the total ``distribution changes''. The regret bounds in both scenarios are nearly optimal, but our algorithm needs to know the parameter $\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ in advance. 
We further show that by employing another technique, our algorithm no longer needs to know the parameters $\mathcal S$ or $\mathcal V$ but the regret bounds could become suboptimal. 
In a special case where the reward function is linear and we have an exact oracle, we design a parameter-free algorithm that achieves nearly optimal regret both in the switching case and in the dynamic case without knowing the parameters in advance.},

In this study, we focus on a sub-class of IM problems, where whether the nodes are willing to be the seeds when being invited is uncertain, called contingency-aware IM. Such contingency aware IM is critical for applications for non-profit organizations in low resource communities (e.g., spreading awareness of disease prevention). Despite the initial success, a major practical obstacle in promoting the solutions to more communities is the tremendous runtime of the greedy algorithms and the lack of high performance computing (HPC) for the non-profits in the field -- whenever there is a new social network, the non-profits usually do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions. Motivated by this and inspired by the line of works that use reinforcement learning (RL) to address combinatorial optimization on graphs, we formalize the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and use RL to learn an IM policy over historically seen networks, and generalize to unseen networks with negligible runtime at test phase. To fully exploit the properties of our targeted problem, we propose two technical innovations that improve the existing methods, including state-abstraction and theoretically grounded reward shaping. Empirical results show that our method achieves influence as high as the state-of-the-art methods for contingency-aware IM, while having negligible runtime at test phase.},

In our work, we propose to leverage an invertible generative model to map the two distributions into a common feature space prior to estimation. This featurization brings the densities closer together in latent space, sidestepping pathological scenarios where the learned density ratios in input space can be arbitrarily inaccurate. At the same time, the invertibility of our feature map guarantees that the ratios computed in feature space are equivalent to those in input space. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a variety of downstream tasks that require access to accurate density ratios such as mutual information estimation, targeted sampling in deep generative models, and classification with data augmentation.},

However, for safety critical tasks, such as robotics and healthcare, it is necessary to provide some specific guarantees before the deployment in a real world context. Even in these scenarios, where high cost equipment and human safety are involved, the evaluation of the models is usually performed with the standard metrics (i.e., cumulative reward or success rate). In this paper, we introduce a novel metric for the evaluation of models in safety critical tasks, the violation rate. We build our work upon the concept of formal verification for neural networks, providing a new formulation for the safety properties that aims to ensure that the agent always makes rational decisions. To perform this evaluation, we present ProVe (Property Verifier), a novel approach based on the interval algebra, designed for the analysis of our novel behavioral properties. We apply our method to different domains (i.e., mapless navigation for mobile robots, trajectory generation for manipulators, and the standard ACAS benchmark). Results show that the violation rate computed by ProVe provides a good evaluation for the safety of trained models.},

Instead, we only have prior information (or description) about seen and unseen classes, often in the form of physically realizable or descriptive attributes. Lack of any single training example from a set of classes prohibits use of standard classification techniques and losses, including the popular crossentropy loss. Currently, state-of-the-art approaches encode the prior class information into dense vectors and optimize some distance between the learned projections of the input vector and the corresponding class vector (collectively known as embedding models). In this paper, we propose a novel architecture of casting zero-shot learning as a standard neural-network with crossentropy loss. During training our approach performs soft-labeling by combining the observed training data for the seen classes with the similarity information from the attributes for which we have no training data or unseen classes. To the best of our knowledge, such similarity based soft-labeling is not explored in the field of deep learning. We evaluate the proposed model on the four benchmark datasets for zero-shot learning, AwA, aPY, SUN and CUB datasets, and show that our model achieves significant improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in Generalized-ZSL and ZSL settings on all of these datasets consistently.},

 abstract = {We study the statistical seriation problem, where the goal is to estimate a matrix whose rows satisfy the same shape constraint after a permutation of the columns. This is a important classical problem, with close connections to statistical literature in permutation-based models and also has wide applications ranging from archaeology to biology. Specifically, we consider the case where the rows are monotonically increasing after an unknown permutation of the columns. Past work has shown that the least-squares estimator is optimal up to logarithmic factors, but efficient algorithms for computing the least-squares estimator remain unknown to date. We approach this important problem from a heuristic perspective. Specifically, we replace the combinatorial permutation constraint by a continuous regularization term, and then use projected gradient descent to obtain a local minimum of the non-convex objective. We show that the attained local minimum is the global minimum in certain special cases under the noiseless setting, and preserves desirable properties under the noisy setting. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm outperforms prior algorithms when (1) the underlying model is more complex than simplistic parametric assumptions such as low-rankedness, or (2) the signal-to-noise ratio is high. Under partial observations, the proposed algorithm requires an initialization, and different initializations may lead to different local minima. We empirically observe that the proposed algorithm yields consistent improvement over the initialization, even though different initializations start with different levels of quality.},

 abstract = {Density estimation could be viewed as a core component in machine learning, since a good estimator could be used to solve many tasks such as classification, regression, and imputing missing values. The main challenge of density estimation is balancing the model expressiveness and its learning and inference complexity. Probabilistic circuits (PCs) model a probability distribution as a computational graph. By imposing specific structural properties on such models many inference tasks become tractable. However, learning PCs usually relies on greedy and time consuming procedures. In this paper we propose a new unified approach to efficiently learn PCs having several structural properties. We introduce extremely randomized PCs (XPCs), PCs with a random structure. We show their advantage on standard density estimation benchmarks when compared to other density estimators.},

Although several algorithms exist for these problems with promising empirical results, regret analysis and efficient use of other-agent models in general-sum games is very limited. We propose an algorithm (TSMG) for general-sum Markov games against agents that switch between several stationary policies, combining change detection with Thompson sampling to learn parametric models of these policies. Under standard assumptions for parametric Markov decision process (MDP) learning, the expected regret of TSMG in the worst case over policy parameters and switch schedules is near-optimal in time and number of switches, up to logarithmic factors. Our experiments on simulated games show that TSMG can outperform standard Thompson sampling and a version of Thompson sampling with a static reset schedule, despite the violation of an assumption that the MDPs induced by the other player are ergodic.},

 abstract = {Weighted model counting (WMC) has emerged as the unifying inference mechanism across many (probabilistic) domains. Encoding an inference problem as an instance of WMC typically necessitates adding extra literals and clauses. This is partly so because the predominant definition of WMC assigns weights to models based on weights on literals, and this severely restricts what probability distributions can be represented. We develop a measure-theoretic perspective on WMC and propose a way to encode conditional weights on literals analogously to conditional probabilities. This representation can be as succinct as standard WMC with weights on literals but can also expand as needed to represent probability distributions with less structure. To demonstrate the performance benefits of conditional weights over the addition of extra literals, we develop a new WMC encoding for Bayesian networks and adapt a state-of-the-art WMC algorithm ADDMC to the new format. Our experiments show that the new encoding significantly improves the performance of the algorithm on most benchmark instances.},

Despite its convexity, evaluating the objective function is #P-hard. Previous approaches use samples from MCMC and its variants to approximate the objective function but have a slow mixing rate. We present XOR-SGD, a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) approach guaranteed to converge to solutions that are at most a constant away from the true optimum in linear number of iterations. XOR-SGD harnesses XOR-sampling, which reduces the sample approximation of the expectation into queries of NP oracles via hashing and projection. We evaluate XOR-SGD on two real-world applications. The first stochastic inventory management problem searches for a robust inventory management plan in preparation for the virus pandemics, natural disasters, etc. The second network design problem decides an optimal land conservation plan which promotes the free movement of wild-life animals. We show that our approach finds better solutions with drastically fewer samples needed compared to a couple of state-of-the-art solvers.},

 abstract = {Adversarial machine learning has attracted a great amount of attention in recent years. In a poisoning attack, the adversary can inject a small number of specially crafted samples into the training data which make the decision boundary severely deviate and cause unexpected misclassification. Due to the great importance and popular use of support vector machines (SVM), we consider defending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper. We study two commonly used strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms and data sanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before, most of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience, or rely on strong assumptions about the data distribution or the attacker's behavior. Moreover, the research on their complexities is still quite limited. We are the first, to the best of our knowledge, to prove that even the simplest hard-margin one-class SVM with outliers problem is NP-complete, and has no fully PTAS unless P$=$NP (that means it is hard to achieve an even approximate algorithm). For the data sanitization defense, we link it to the intrinsic dimensionality of data; in particular, we provide a sampling theorem in doubling metrics for explaining the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a density-based outlier removal method) for defending against poisoning attacks. In our empirical experiments, we compare several defenses including the DBSCAN and robust SVM methods, and investigate the influences from the intrinsic dimensionality and data density to their performances.},

PALM generatively learn the alignment of two protein sequences with probabilistic area distance objective, which can denoise the measurement errors and offsets from different biologists. During learning, we show that the optimization is computationally efficient by estimating the gradients via dynamically sampling alignments.

In many control problems, e.g., partially observed linear dynamical systems (POLDS), oftentimes the inferred latent state is further used for planning at each step. This paper initiates a rigorous study on the efficiency of particle filtering for sequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity bounds. Though errors in past actions may affect the future, we are able to bound the number of particles needed so that the long-run reward of the policy based on particle filtering is close to that based on exact inference. In particular, we show that, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice. Key in our proof is a coupling of the ideal sequence based on the exact planning and the sequence generated by approximate planning based on particle filtering. We believe this technique can be useful in other sequential decision-making problems.},

We demonstrate that our approach, which relies on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for inference, can rapidly identify sparse subspaces relevant to modeling the unknown objective function, enabling sample-efficient high-dimensional BO.

 abstract = {Meta-learning learns across historical tasks with the goal to discover a representation from which it is easy to adapt to new unseen tasks. Episodic meta-learning simulates a realistic setting by generating a set of small artificial tasks from a larger fixed training set for meta-training and proceeds in a similar fashion for meta-testing. However, this (meta-)learning paradigm has recently been shown to be brittle in practice, suggesting that the inductive bias encoded in the learned representations is inadequate. In this work we propose to compose episodes to robustify meta-learning in the few-shot setting, in order to learn more efficiently and to generalize better to new tasks. We make use of active learning scoring rules to select the data to be included in the episodes. We assume that the meta-learner is given new tasks at random, but the data associated to the tasks can be selected from a larger pool of unlabeled data, and investigate where active learning can boost the performance of episodic meta-learning. We show that instead of selecting samples at random, it is better to select samples in an active manner especially in settings with out-of-distribution and class-imbalanced tasks. We evaluate our method with Prototypical Networks, foMAML and protoMAML, reporting significant improvements on public benchmarks.},

We find that this is possible if and only if the two variables are `densely connected'; in other words, if applications of identifiable causal interventions on the graph cannot (non-trivially) separate them. As a consequence of this, we can also allow such pairs of random variables have any bivariate joint distribution that we choose.

GCD could be significantly faster than randomized coordinate descent (RCD) if they have similar per iteration cost. Nevertheless, in some cases, the greedy rule used in GCD cannot be efficiently implemented, leading to huge per iteration cost and making GCD slower than RCD. To alleviate the cost per iteration, the existing solutions rely on maximum inner product search (MIPS) as an approximate greedy rule. But it has been empirically shown that GCD with approximate greedy rule could suffer from slow convergence even with the state-of-the-art MIPS algorithms. We propose a hybrid coordinate descent algorithm with a simple variable partition strategy to tackle the cases when greedy rule cannot be implemented efficiently. The convergence rate and theoretical properties of the new algorithm are presented. The proposed method is shown to be especially useful when the data matrix has a group structure. Numerical experiments with both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our new algorithm is competitive against RCD, GCD, approximate GCD with MIPS and their accelerated variants.},

However, this also brings in the risk of overfitting and computational challenges, especially in the case of fast streaming data. To address these issues, we develop BASS-Tucker, a BAyesian Streaming Sparse Tucker decomposition method. We place a spike-and-slab prior over the core tensor elements to automatically select meaningful factor interactions so as to prevent overfitting and to further enhance the interpretability. To enable efficient streaming factorization, we use conditional moment matching and Delta's method to develop one-shot incremental update of the latent factors and core tensor upon receiving each streaming batch. Thereby, we avoid processing the data points one by one as in the standard assumed density filtering, which needs to update the core tensor for each point and is quite inefficient. We explicitly introduce and update a sparse prior approximation in the running posterior to fulfill effective sparse estimation in the streaming inference. We show the advantage of BASS-Tucker in several real-world applications.},

For discrete domains, weighted model counting has emerged as an effective and general approach in a variety of formalisms, and lifted reasoning has pushed the envelope further in exploiting symmetry properties over indistinguishable groups of objects, thereby avoiding the need to perform inference on the exponential ground theory. Given the limitation to discrete domains, the formulation of weighted model integration was proposed as an extension to weighted model counting for mixed discrete-continuous domains over both symbolic and numeric weight functions. While that formulation has enjoyed considerable attention in recent years, there is very little understanding on whether the task can be solved at a lifted level, that is, whether we can reason with relational models by avoiding grounding. In this paper, we consider this question. We show how to generalize algorithmic ideas known in the circuit compilation for function-free lifted inference to functions with a continuous range.},

 abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with hidden variables are often used to characterize causal relations between variables in a system. When some variables are unobserved, DAGs imply a notoriously complicated set of constraints on the distribution of observed variables. In this work, we present entropic inequality constraints that are implied by $e$-separation relations in hidden variable DAGs with discrete observed variables. The constraints can intuitively be understood to follow from the fact that the capacity of variables along a causal pathway to convey information is restricted by their entropy; e.g. at the extreme case, a variable with entropy $0$ can convey no information. We show how these constraints can be used to learn about the true causal model from an observed data distribution. In addition, we propose a measure of causal influence called the minimal mediary entropy, and demonstrate that it can augment traditional measures such as the average causal effect.},

 abstract = {When data contains measurement errors, it is necessary to make assumptions relating the observed, erroneous data to the unobserved true phenomena of interest. These assumptions should be justifiable on substantive grounds, but are often motivated by mathematical convenience, for the sake of exactly identifying the target of inference. We adopt the view that it is preferable to present bounds under justifiable assumptions than to pursue exact identification under dubious ones. To that end, we demonstrate how a broad class of modeling assumptions involving discrete variables, including common measurement error and conditional independence assumptions, can be expressed as linear constraints on the parameters of the model. We then use linear programming techniques to produce sharp bounds for factual and counterfactual distributions under measurement error in such models. We additionally propose a procedure for obtaining outer bounds on non-linear models. Our method yields sharp bounds in a number of important settings -- such as the instrumental variable scenario with measurement error -- for which no bounds were previously known.},

 abstract = {Most recent few-shot learning (FSL) methods are based on meta-learning with episodic training. In each meta-training episode, a discriminative feature embedding and/or classifier are first constructed from a support set in an inner loop, and then evaluated in an outer loop using a query set for model updating. This query set sample centered learning objective is however intrinsically limited in addressing the lack of training data problem in the support set. In this paper, a novel contrastive prototype learning with augmented embeddings (CPLAE) model is proposed to overcome this limitation. First, data augmentations are introduced to both the support and query sets with each sample now being represented as an augmented embedding (AE) composed of concatenated embeddings of both the original and augmented versions. Second, a novel support set class prototype centered contrastive loss is proposed for contrastive prototype learning (CPL). With a class prototype as an anchor, CPL aims to pull the query samples of the same class closer and those of different classes further away. This support set sample centered loss is highly complementary to the existing query centered loss, fully exploiting the limited training data in each episode. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CPLAE achieves new state-of-the-art.},

Our first contribution is to formalize the problem in various settings and to explicitly model subtle aspects such as the proper or improper nature of the learning, learner's randomness, and whether (or not) adversary's attack can depend on it. Our main result shows that when the budget of the adversary scales sublinearly with the sample complexity, (improper) PAC learnability and certification are achievable; in contrast, when the adversary's budget grows linearly with the sample complexity, the adversary can potentially drive up the expected 0-1 loss to one. We also study distribution-specific PAC learning in the same attack model and show that proper learning with certification is possible for learning half spaces under natural distributions. Finally, we empirically study the robustness of K nearest neighbour, logistic regression, multi-layer perceptron, and convolutional neural network on real data sets against targeted-poisoning attacks. Our experimental results show that many models, especially state-of-the-art neural networks, are indeed vulnerable to these strong attacks. Interestingly, we observe that methods with high standard accuracy might be more vulnerable to instance-targeted poisoning attacks.},

They have been used to analyse the behaviour of finite networks, as well as being useful methods in their own right. When investigating infinitely wide convolutional neural networks (CNNs), it was observed that the correlations arising from spatial weight sharing disappear in the infinite limit. This is undesirable, as spatial correlation is the main motivation behind CNNs. We show that the loss of this property is not a consequence of the infinite limit, but rather of choosing an independent weight prior. Correlating the weights maintains the correlations in the activations. Varying the amount of correlation interpolates between independent-weight limits and mean-pooling. Empirical evaluation of the infinitely wide network shows that optimal performance is achieved between the extremes, indicating that correlations can be useful.},

Despite some promising recent advances in the topic, very little attention has been given to the problem of effectively learning PSDDs from data and logical constraints in large domains. In this paper we show that a simple strategy of sampling and averaging PSDDs leads to state-of-the-art performance in many tasks. We overcome some of the issues with previous methods by employing a top-down generation of circuits from a logic formula represented as a BDD. We discuss how to locally grow the circuit while achieving a good trade-off between complexity and goodness-of-fit of the resulting model. Generalization error is further decreased by aggregating sampled circuits through Bayesian model combination. Experiments with various domains show that the approach efficiently learns good models even in very low data regimes, while remaining competitive for large sample sizes.},

Furthermore, the decision-maker's task may evolve, resulting in a varying loss function. In this setting, we explore sequential decision-making problems modeled by adversarial Markov decision processes, where the loss function may arbitrarily change at every time step. We consider the bandit feedback scenario, where the agent observes only the loss corresponding to its actions. We propose an algorithm, called online relative-entropy policy search with implicit exploration, that achieves a sublinear regret not only in expectation but, more importantly, with high probability. In particular, we prove that by employing an optimistically biased loss estimator, the proposed algorithm achieves a regret of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3} \sqrt{\tau|A||S|})$, where $|S|$ is the number of states, $|A|$ is the number of actions, $\tau$ is the mixing time, and $T$ is the time horizon. To our knowledge, the proposed algorithm is the first scheme that enjoys such high-probability regret bounds for general adversarial Markov decision processes under the presence of bandit feedback.},

One of the main challenges of active search with multiple agents in unknown environments is impracticality of central coordination due to the difficulties of connectivity maintenance. In this paper, we propose two distinct active search algorithms that allow for multiple robots to independently make data-collection decisions without a central coordinator. Throughout we consider that targets are sparsely located around the environment in keeping with compressive sensing assumptions and its applicability in real world scenarios. Additionally, while most common sensing algorithms assume that agents can sense the entire environment (e.g. compressive sensing) or sense point-wise (e.g. Bayesian Optimization) at a time, we make a realistic assumption that each agent can only sense a contiguous region of space at each time step. We provide simulation results as well as theoretical analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.},

However, none of the existing approaches transfer knowledge contextually from model-based learners to a model-free learner. This could be useful, for instance, when source policies are intentionally learned on diverse simulations with plentiful data but transferred to a real-world setting with limited data. In this paper, we assume knowledge of estimated source task dynamics and policies, and common sub-goals but different dynamics. We introduce a novel deep mixture-of-experts formulation for learning state-dependent beliefs over source task dynamics that match the target dynamics using state trajectories collected from the target task. The mixture model is easy to interpret, demonstrates robustness to estimation errors in dynamics, and is compatible with most learning algorithms. We then show how this model can be incorporated into standard policy reuse frameworks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on benchmarks from OpenAI-Gym.},

 abstract = {An important achievement in the field of causal inference was a complete characterization of when a causal effect, in a system modeled by a causal graph, can be determined uniquely from purely observational data. The identification algorithms resulting from this work produce exact symbolic expressions for causal effects, in terms of the observational probabilities. More recent work has looked at the numerical properties of these expressions, in particular using the classical notion of the condition number. In its classical interpretation, the condition number quantifies the sensitivity of the output values of the expressions to small numerical perturbations in the input observational probabilities. In the context of causal identification, the condition number has also been shown to be related to the effect of certain kinds of uncertainties in the structure of the causal graphical model. In this paper, we first give an upper bound on the condition number for the interesting case of causal graphical models with small confounded components. We then develop a tight characterization of the condition number of any given causal identification problem. Finally, we use our tight characterization to give a specific example where the condition number can be much lower than that obtained via generic bounds on the condition number, and to show that even equivalent formulas for causal identification can behave very differently with respect to their numerical stability properties.},

However, in several applications, there is a natural cost function that can be used to characterize the quality of the clustering. In those cases, hierarchical clustering can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem. To that end, we introduce a new approach based on A* search. We overcome the prohibitively large search space by combining A* with a novel \emph{trellis} data structure. This combination results in an exact algorithm that scales beyond previous state of the art, from a search space with $10^{12}$ trees to $10^{15}$ trees, and an approximate algorithm that improves over baselines, even in enormous search spaces that contain more than $10^{1000}$ trees. We empirically demonstrate that our method achieves substantially higher quality results than baselines for a particle physics use case and other clustering benchmarks. We describe how our method provides significantly improved theoretical bounds on the time and space complexity of A* for clustering.},

In these scenarios it may be beneficial to trade the cost of collecting an environmental measurement against the quality or "fidelity" of this measurement and how the measurement affects changepoint estimation. For instance, one might decide between inertial measurements or GPS to determine changepoints for motion. A Bayesian approach to changepoint detection is particularly appealing because we can represent our posterior uncertainty about changepoints and make active, cost-sensitive decisions about data fidelity to reduce this posterior uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered through active fidelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data distribution. We propose a multi-fidelity approach that makes cost-sensitive decisions about which data fidelity to collect based on maximizing information gain with respect to changepoints. We evaluate this framework on synthetic, video, and audio data and show that this information-based approach results in accurate predictions while reducing total cost.},

In LocalNewton, the worker machines update their model in every iteration by finding a suitable second-order descent direction using only the data and model stored in their own local memory. We let the workers run multiple such iterations locally and communicate the models to the master node only once every few (say $L$) iterations. LocalNewton is highly practical since it requires only one hyperparameter, the number $L$ of local iterations. We use novel matrix concentration based techniques to obtain theoretical guarantees for LocalNewton, and we validate them with detailed empirical evaluation. To enhance practicability, we devise an adaptive scheme to choose $L$, and we show that this reduces the number of local iterations in worker machines between two model synchronizations as the training proceeds, successively refining the model quality at the master. Via extensive experiments using several real-world datasets with AWS Lambda workers and an AWS EC2 master, we show that LocalNewton requires fewer than $60%$ of the communication rounds (between master and workers) and less than $40%$ of the end-to-end running time, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, to reach the same training loss.},

Sometimes the do-calculus identifies multiple valid formulae, prompting us to compare the statistical properties of the corresponding estimators. For example, the backdoor formula applies when all confounders are observed and the frontdoor formula applies when an observed mediator transmits the causal effect. In this paper, we investigate the over-identified scenario where both confounders and mediators are observed, rendering both estimators valid. Addressing the linear Gaussian causal model, we demonstrate that either estimator can dominate the other by an unbounded constant factor. Next, we derive an optimal estimator, which leverages all observed variables, and bound its finite-sample variance. We show that it strictly outperforms the backdoor and frontdoor estimators and that this improvement can be unbounded. We also present a procedure for combining two datasets, one with observed confounders and another with observed mediators.

To achieve tractability, we exploit the underlying graph-theoretic structure of the constraint set in our IP formulation. This enables us to use edge clique covers to substantially reduce the constraint set. Our codebooks achieve a high nominal accuracy relative to standard codebooks (e.g., one-vs-all, one-vs-one, and dense/sparse codes). We also estimate the adversarial accuracy of our ECOC-based classifiers in a white-box setting. Our IP-generated codebooks provide non-trivial robustness to adversarial perturbations even without any adversarial training.},

 abstract = {Several algorithms for finding the best arm in the dueling bandits setting assume the existence of a Condorcet winner (CW), that is, an arm that uniformly dominates all other arms. Yet, by simply relying on this assumption but not verifying it, such algorithms may produce doubtful results in cases where it actually fails to hold. Even worse, the problem may not be noticed, and an alleged CW still be produced. In this paper, we therefore address the problem as a ``testification'' task, by which we mean a combination of testing and identification: The online identification of the CW is combined with the statistical testing of the CW assumption. Thus, instead of returning a supposed CW at some point, the learner has the possibility to stop sampling and refuse an answer in case it feels confident that the CW assumption is violated. Analyzing the testification problem formally, we derive lower bounds on the expected sample complexity of any online algorithm solving it. Moreover, a concrete algorithm is proposed, which achieves the optimal sample complexity up to logarithmic terms.},

Consequently, when the training data contains sensitive attributes, assessing the amount of information leakage is paramount. We propose a method to quantify this leakage using the Fisher information of the model about the data. Unlike the worst-case a priori guarantees of differential privacy, Fisher information loss measures leakage with respect to specific examples, attributes, or sub-populations within the dataset. We motivate Fisher information loss through the Cramer-Rao bound and delineate the implied threat model. We provide efficient methods to compute Fisher information loss for output-perturbed generalized linear models. Finally, we empirically validate Fisher information loss as a useful measure of information leakage.},

 abstract = {Updating observations of a signal due to the delays in the measurement process is a common problem in signal processing, with prominent examples in a wide range of fields. An important example of this problem is the nowcasting of COVID-19 mortality: given a stream of reported counts of daily deaths, can we correct for the delays in reporting to paint an accurate picture of the present, with uncertainty? Without this correction, raw data will often mislead by suggesting an improving situation. We present a flexible approach using a latent Gaussian process that is capable of describing the changing auto-correlation structure present in the reporting time-delay surface. This approach also yields robust estimates of uncertainty for the estimated nowcasted numbers of deaths. We test assumptions in model specification such as the choice of kernel or hyper priors, and evaluate model performance on a challenging real dataset from Brazil. Our experiments show that Gaussian process nowcasting performs favourably against both comparable methods, and against a small sample of expert human predictions. Our approach has substantial practical utility in disease modelling -- by applying our approach to COVID-19 mortality data from Brazil, where reporting delays are large, we can make informative predictions on important epidemiological quantities such as the current effective reproduction number.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the relationship between generalization and privacy preservation in iterative learning algorithms by two sequential steps. We first establish an alignment between generalization and privacy preservation for any learning algorithm. We prove that $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy implies an on-average generalization bound for multi-database learning algorithms which further leads to a high-probability bound for any learning algorithm. This high-probability bound also implies a PAC-learnable guarantee for differentially private learning algorithms. We then investigate how the iterative nature shared by most learning algorithms influence privacy preservation and further generalization. Three composition theorems are proposed to approximate the differential privacy of any iterative algorithm through the differential privacy of its every iteration. By integrating the above two steps, we eventually deliver generalization bounds for iterative learning algorithms, which suggest one can simultaneously enhance privacy preservation and generalization. Our results are strictly tighter than the existing works. Particularly, our generalization bounds do not rely on the model size which is prohibitively large in deep learning. This sheds light to understanding the generalizability of deep learning. These results apply to a wide spectrum of learning algorithms. In this paper, we apply them to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and agnostic federated learning as examples.},

To overcome this issue, we apply an MLMC sampling technique to construct low-variance unbiased estimators both for the model evidence and its gradient. In the theoretical analysis, we show that the computational cost required for our proposed MLMC estimator to estimate the model evidence or its gradient with a given accuracy is an order of magnitude smaller than those of the previously known estimators. Our numerical experiments confirm considerable computational savings compared to the conventional estimators. Combining our MLMC estimator with gradient-based stochastic optimization results in a new scalable, efficient, debiased inference algorithm for Bayesian statistical models.},

Past work in this field has relied on traditional optimization algorithms that ignore the inherent structure of the problem and data, or generative methods that rely purely on learning and often fail to generate adversarial examples where they are hard to find. To alleviate these deficiencies, we propose a novel attack based on a graph neural network (GNN) that takes advantage of the strengths of both approaches; we call it AdvGNN. Our GNN architecture closely resembles the network we wish to attack. During inference, we perform forward-backward passes through the GNN layers to guide an iterative procedure towards adversarial examples. During training, its parameters are estimated via a loss function that encourages the efficient computation of adversarial examples over a time horizon. We show that our method beats state-of-the-art adversarial attacks, including PGD-attack, MI-FGSM, and Carlini and Wagner attack, reducing the time required to generate adversarial examples with small perturbation norms by over 65\%. Moreover, AdvGNN achieves good generalization performance on unseen networks. Finally, we provide a new challenging dataset specifically designed to allow for a more illustrative comparison of adversarial attacks.},

 abstract = {Variational Inference (VI) is a popular alternative to asymptotically exact sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence (RKL), which typically underestimates the tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy. Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally, the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that our method is competitive with variational boosting and MCMC.},

To utilize tree structure, TreeBERT represents the AST corresponding to the code as a set of composition paths and introduces node position embedding. The model is trained by tree masked language modeling (TMLM) and node order prediction (NOP) with a hybrid objective. TMLM uses a novel masking strategy designed according to the tree's characteristics to help the model understand the AST and infer the missing semantics of the AST. With NOP, TreeBERT extracts the syntactical structure by learning the order constraints of nodes in AST. We pre-trained TreeBERT on datasets covering multiple programming languages. On code summarization and code documentation tasks, TreeBERT outperforms other pre-trained models and state-of-the-art models designed for these tasks. Furthermore, TreeBERT performs well when transferred to the pre-trained unseen programming language.},

Specifically, we derive generalization error bounds for a class of deep unfolding RNNs via Rademacher complexity analysis. To our knowledge, these are the first generalization bounds proposed for deep unfolding RNNs. We show theoretically that our bounds are tighter than similar ones for other recent RNNs, in terms of the number of timesteps. By training models in a classification setting, we demonstrate that deep unfolding RNNs can outperform traditional RNNs in standard sequence classification tasks. These experiments allow us to relate the empirical generalization error to the theoretical bounds. In particular, we show that over-parametrized deep unfolding models like reweighted-RNN achieve tight theoretical error bounds with minimal decrease in accuracy, when trained with explicit regularization.},

We show a new and surprising fact about SGD, in that depending on the constraint set C, one can operate SGD with much lower-dimensional stochastic gradients without affecting its performance. In particular, we design an optimization algorithm that operates with the lower-dimensional (compressed) stochastic gradients, and establish that with the right set of parameters it has the exact same dimension-free convergence guarantees as that of regular SGD for popular convex and nonconvex optimization settings. We also present two applications of these bounds, one for improving the empirical risk minimization bounds in differentially private nonconvex optimization, and other for reducing communication costs with distributed SGD. Additionally, we also show that this connection between constraint set structure and gradient compression also extends beyond SGD to the conditional gradient (Frank-Wolfe) method.

The premise of all current systems-of-inference for deriving CIs in PGMs, is that the set of CIs used for the construction of the PGM hold exactly. In practice, algorithms for extracting the structure of PGMs from data, discover approximate CIs that do not hold exactly in the distribution. In this paper, we ask how the error in this set propagates to the inferred CIs read off the graphical structure. More precisely, what guarantee can we provide on the inferred CI when the set of CIs that entailed it hold only approximately? It has recently been shown that in the general case, no such guarantee can be provided. We prove that such a guarantee exists for the set of CIs inferred in directed graphical models, making the d-separation algorithm a sound and complete system for inferring approximate CIs. We also prove an approximation guarantee for independence relations derived from marginal CIs.},

 abstract = {Federated learning becomes a prominent approach when different entities want to learn collaboratively a common model without sharing their training data. However, Federated learning has two main drawbacks. First, it is quite bandwidth inefficient as it involves a lot of message exchanges between the aggregating server and the participating entities. This bandwidth and corresponding processing costs could be prohibitive if the participating entities are, for example, mobile devices. Furthermore, although federated learning improves privacy by not sharing data, recent attacks have shown that it still leaks information about the training data. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving federated learning scheme. The proposed scheme provides theoretical privacy guarantees, as it is based on Differential Privacy. Furthermore, it optimizes the model accuracy by constraining the model learning phase on few selected weights. Finally, as shown experimentally, it reduces the upstream and downstream bandwidth by up to 99.9% compared to standard federated learning, making it practical for mobile systems.},

We further extend this model such that the prior on the structure of each hidden layer is shared globally across all layers, using a Hierarchical-IBP (H-IBP). We apply this model to the problem of resource allocation in Continual Learning (CL) where new tasks occur and the network requires extra resources. Our model uses online variational inference with reparameterisation of the Bernoulli and Beta distributions, which constitute the IBP and H-IBP priors. As we automatically learn the number of weights in each layer of the BNN, overfitting and underfitting problems are largely overcome. We show empirically that our approach offers a competitive edge over existing methods in CL.},

 abstract = {We present a novel model for capturing the behavior of an agent exhibiting sunk-cost bias in a stochastic environment. Agents exhibiting sunk-cost bias take into account the effort they have already spent on an endeavor when they evaluate whether to continue or abandon it. We model planning tasks in which an agent with this type of bias tries to reach a designated goal. Our model structures this problem as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking, the agent traverses a directed acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions, paying costs for its actions as it tries to reach a target node containing a specified reward. The agent's sunk cost bias is modeled by a cost that it incurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent decides to stop traversing the graph, it incurs a cost of $\lambda \cdot C_{sunk}$, where ${\lambda \geq 0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and $C_{sunk}$ is the sum of costs already invested. We analyze the behavior of two types of agents: naive agents that are unaware of their bias, and sophisticated agents that are aware of it. Since optimal (bias-free) behavior in this problem can involve abandoning the traversal before reaching the goal, the bias exhibited by these types of agents can result in sub-optimal behavior by shifting their decisions about abandonment. We show that in contrast to optimal agents, it is computationally hard to compute the optimal policy for a sophisticated agent. Our main results quantify the loss exhibited by these two types of agents with respect to an optimal agent. We present both general and topology-specific bounds.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies based on deep neural networks are vulnerable to imperceptible adversarial perturbations to their inputs, in much the same way as neural network image classifiers. Recent work has proposed several methods to improve the robustness of deep reinforcement learning agents to adversarial perturbations based on training in the presence of these imperceptible perturbations (i.e. adversarial training). In this paper, we study the effects of adversarial training on the neural policy learned by the agent. In particular, we follow two distinct parallel approaches to investigate the outcomes of adversarial training on deep neural policies based on worst-case distributional shift and feature sensitivity. For the first approach, we compare the Fourier spectrum of minimal perturbations computed for both adversarially trained and vanilla trained neural policies. Via experiments in the OpenAI Atari environments we show that minimal perturbations computed for adversarially trained policies are more focused on lower frequencies in the Fourier domain, indicating a higher sensitivity of these policies to low frequency perturbations. For the second approach, we propose a novel method to measure the feature sensitivities of deep neural policies and we compare these feature sensitivity differences in state-of-the-art adversarially trained deep neural policies and vanilla trained deep neural policies. We believe our results can be an initial step towards understanding the relationship between adversarial training and different notions of robustness for neural policies.},

We demonstrate that Trumpets can be trained orders of magnitudes faster than standard flows while yielding samples of comparable or better quality. They retain many of the advantages of the standard flows such as training based on maximum likelihood and a fast, exact inverse of the generator. Since Trumpets are injective and have fast inverses, they can be effectively used for downstream Bayesian inference. To wit, we use Trumpet priors for maximum a posteriori estimation in the context of image reconstruction from compressive measurements, outperforming competitive baselines in terms of reconstruction quality and speed.

As in other approximate BNNs, one cannot necessarily expect the induced predictive uncertainty to be calibrated. Here we develop a formalism to explicitly train the uncertainty in a decoupled way to the prediction itself. To this end, we introduce uncertainty units for Laplace-approximated networks: Hidden units associated with a particular weight structure that can be added to any pre-trained, point-estimated network. Due to their weights, these units are inactive---they do not affect the predictions. But their presence changes the geometry (in particular the Hessian) of the loss landscape, thereby affecting the network's uncertainty estimates under a Laplace approximation. We show that such units can be trained via an uncertainty-aware objective, improving standard Laplace approximations' performance in various uncertainty quantification tasks.},

 abstract = {In many real-world scenarios, such as gene knockout experiments, targeted interventions are often accompanied by unknown interventions at off-target sites. Moreover, different units can get randomly exposed to different unknown interventions, thereby creating a mixture of interventions. Identifying different components of this mixture can be very valuable in some applications. Motivated by such situations, in this work, we study the problem of identifying all components present in a mixture of interventions on a given causal Bayesian Network. We construct an example to show that, in general, the components are not identifiable from the mixture distribution. Next, assuming that the given network satisfies a positivity condition, we show that, if the set of mixture components satisfy a mild exclusion assumption, then they can be uniquely identified. Our proof gives an efficient algorithm to recover these targets from the exponentially large search space of possible targets. In the more realistic scenario, where distributions are given via finitely many samples, we conduct a simulation study to analyze the performance of an algorithm derived from our identifiability proof.},

However, learning the individual representation models from observations and clustering individual models to group models are often considered as two separate tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel tree structure variational Bayesian method to learn the individual model and group model simultaneously by treating the group models as the parents of individual models, so that the individual model is learned from observations and regularized by its parents, and conversely, the parent model will be optimized to best represent its children. Due to the regularization process, our method has advantages when the number of training samples decreases.

 abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a popular method for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. BO budgets are typically given in iterations, which implicitly assumes each evaluation has the same cost. In fact, in many BO applications, evaluation costs vary significantly in different regions of the search space. In hyperparameter optimization, the time spent on neural network training increases with layer size; in clinical trials, the monetary cost of drug compounds vary; and in optimal control, control actions have differing complexities. Cost-constrained BO measures convergence with alternative cost metrics such as time, money, or energy, for which the sample efficiency of standard BO methods is ill-suited. For cost-constrained BO, cost efficiency is far more important than sample efficiency. In this paper, we formulate cost-constrained BO as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), and develop an efficient rollout approximation to the optimal CMDP policy that takes both the cost and future iterations into account. We validate our method on a collection of hyperparameter optimization problems as well as a sensor set selection application.},

However, in many real world systems, inputs are passed through a sequence of different operations or modules, making variables in earlier stages of processing more costly to update. Such structure imposes a cost on switching variables in early parts of a data processing pipeline. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for switch cost-aware optimization called Lazy Modular Bayesian Optimization (LaMBO). This method efficiently identifies the global optimum while minimizing cost through a passive change of variables in early modules. The method is theoretical grounded and achieves vanishing regret when augmented with switching cost. We apply LaMBO to multiple synthetic functions and a three-stage image segmentation pipeline used in a neuroscience application, where we obtain promising improvements over prevailing cost-aware Bayesian optimization algorithms.

However, observations with missing values present serious difficulties in directly applying standard dimension reduction techniques. As a large number of dimension reduction approaches are based on the Gram matrix, we first investigate the effects of missingness on dimension reduction by studying the statistical properties of the Gram matrix with or without missingness, and then we present a bias-corrected Gram matrix with nice statistical properties under heterogeneous missingness. Extensive empirical results, on both simulated and publicly available real datasets, show that the proposed unbiased Gram matrix can significantly improve a broad spectrum of representative dimension reduction approaches.},

Our analysis reveals that finite size residual architectures are initialized much closer to the "kernel regime" than their vanilla counterparts: while in networks that do not use skip connections, convergence to the NTK requires one to fix the depth, while increasing the layers' width. Our findings show that in ResNets, convergence to the NTK may occur when depth and width simultaneously tend to infinity, provided with a proper initialization. In DenseNets, however, convergence of the NTK to its limit as the width tends to infinity is guaranteed, at a rate that is independent of both the depth and scale of the weights. Our experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the advantage of deep ResNets and DenseNets for kernel regression with random gradient features.},

A large body of work has demonstrated that exploration mechanisms based on the principle of optimism under uncertainty can significantly improve the sample efficiency of RL in single agent tasks. This work seeks to understand the role of optimistic exploration in non-cooperative multi-agent settings. We will show that, in zero-sum games, optimistic exploration can cause the learner to waste time sampling parts of the state space that are irrelevant to strategic play, as they can only be reached through cooperation between both players. To address this issue, we introduce a formal notion of strategically efficient exploration in Markov games, and use this to develop two strategically efficient learning algorithms for finite Markov games. We demonstrate that these methods can be significantly more sample efficient than their optimistic counterparts.},

Given a set of $n$ arms indexed from $1$ to $n$, each arm $i$ is associated with an unknown reward distribution supported on $[0,1]$ with mean $\theta_i$ and variance $\sigma_i^2$. Assume $\theta_1 > \theta_2 \geq \cdots \geq\theta_n$. We propose an adaptive algorithm which explores the gaps and variances of the rewards of the arms and makes future decisions based on the gathered information using a novel approach called \textit{grouped median elimination}. The proposed algorithm guarantees to output the best arm with probability $(1-\delta)$ and uses at most $O \left(\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i}\right)(\ln \delta^{-1} + \ln \ln \Delta_i^{-1})\right)$ samples, where $\Delta_i$ ($i \geq 2$) denotes the reward gap between arm $i$ and the best arm and we define $\Delta_1 = \Delta_2$. This achieves a significant advantage over the variance-independent algorithms in some favorable scenarios and is the first result that removes the extra $\ln n$ factor on the best arm compared with the state-of-the-art. We further show that $\Omega \left( \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta_i} \right) \ln \delta^{-1} \right)$ samples are necessary for an algorithm to achieve the same goal, thereby illustrating that our algorithm is optimal up to doubly logarithmic terms.},

 abstract = {Neural networks with ReLU activation functions (abbrev. ReLU Networks), have demonstrated their success in many applications. Recently, researchers noticed that ReLU networks are positively scale-invariant (PSI) while the weights are not. This mismatch may lead to undesirable behaviors in the optimization process. Hence, some new algorithms that conduct optimization directly in the \textit{path space} (the path space is proven to be PSI) were developed, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the path space. However, it is still unknown that whether other deep learning techniques such as batch normalization (BN), could also have their counterparts in the path space. In this paper, we conduct a formal study on the design of BN in the path space. First, we propose \emph{path-reparameterization} of ReLU networks, in which the weights in the networks are reparameterized by path-values. Then, the feedforward and backward propagation of the path-reparameterized networks can calculate the values of the hidden nodes and the gradients in the path space, respectively. Next, we design the a novel way to do batch normalization for the path-reparameterized ReLU networks, called \emph{Path-BN}. Specifically, we notice that, path-reparameterized ReLU NNs have a portion of constant weights which play more critical roles to form the basis of the path space. We propose to exclude these constant weights when doing batch normalization and prove that, by doing so, the scale and the direction of the trained parameters can be more effectively decoupled during training. Finally, we conduct experiments on benchmark datasets. The results show that our proposed Path-BN can improve the performance of the optimization algorithms in the path space.},

 abstract = {Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), despite their tremendous success in recent years, could still cast doubts on their predictions due to the intrinsic uncertainty associated with their learning process. Ensemble techniques and post-hoc calibrations are two types of approaches that have individually shown promise in improving the uncertainty calibration of DNNs. However, the synergistic effect of the two types of methods has not been well explored. In this paper, we propose a truth discovery framework to integrate ensemble-based and post-hoc calibration methods. Using the geometric variance of the ensemble candidates as a good indicator for sample uncertainty, we design an accuracy-preserving truth estimator with provably no accuracy drop. Furthermore, we show that post-hoc calibration can also be enhanced by truth discovery-regularized optimization. On large-scale datasets including CIFAR and ImageNet, our method shows consistent improvement against state-of-the-art calibration approaches on both histogram-based and kernel density-based evaluation metrics.

The effects that unobserved variables have on the relationships between observed variables are more complex in nonlinear cases than in linear cases. In this study, we focus on causal additive models in the presence of unobserved variables. Causal additive models exhibit structural equations that are additive in the variables and error terms. We take into account not only the presence of unobserved common causes but also that of unobserved intermediate variables. Our theoretical results show that, when the causal relationships are nonlinear and there are unobserved variables, it is not possible to identify all the causal relationships between observed variables through regression and independence tests. However, our theoretical results also show that it is possible to avoid incorrect inferences. We propose a method to identify all the causal relationships that are theoretically possible to identify without being biased by unobserved variables. The empirical results using artificial data and simulated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data show that our method effectively infers causal structures in the presence of unobserved variables.},

 abstract = {Gaussian Processes (GPs) are known to provide accurate predictions and uncertainty estimates even with small amounts of labeled data by capturing similarity between data points through their kernel function. However traditional GP kernels are not very effective at capturing similarity between high dimensional data points. Neural networks can be used to learn good representations that encode intricate structures in high dimensional data, and can be used as inputs to the GP kernel. However the huge data requirement of neural networks makes this approach ineffective in small data settings. To solves the conflicting problems of representation learning and data efficiency, we propose to learn deep kernels on probabilistic embeddings by using a probabilistic neural network. Our approach maps high-dimensional data to a probability distribution in a low dimensional subspace and then computes a kernel between these distributions to capture similarity. To enable end-to-end learning, we derive a functional gradient descent procedure for training the model. Experiments on a variety of datasets show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in GP kernel learning in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. We also extend our approach to other small-data paradigms such as few-shot classification where it outperforms previous approaches on mini-Imagenet and CUB datasets.},

Instead, NMLNs learn an implicit representation of such rules as a neural network that acts as a potential function on fragments of the relational structure. Similarly to many neural symbolic methods, NMLNs can exploit embeddings of constants but, unlike them, NMLNs work well also in their absence. This is extremely important for predicting in settings other than the transductive one.

In this work, we propose a weaker assumption that we call $2$-adjacency faithfulness. In contrast to adjacency faithfulness, which assumes that there is no conditional independence between each pair of variables that are connected in the causal graph, we only require no conditional independence between a node and a subset of its Markov blanket that can contain up to two nodes. Equivalently, we adapt orientation faithfulness to this setting. We further propose a sound orientation rule for causal discovery that applies under weaker assumptions. As a proof of concept, we derive a modified Grow and Shrink algorithm that recovers the Markov blanket of a target node and prove its correctness under strictly weaker assumptions than the standard faithfulness assumption.},

There is vast literature on efficient algorithms for constructing data structures and performing exact and approximate NNS. This paper studies NNS under Uncertainty (NNSU). Specifically, consider the setting in which an NNS algorithm has access only to a stochastic distance oracle that provides a noisy, unbiased estimate of the distance between any pair of points, rather than the exact distance. This models many situations of practical importance, including NNS based on human similarity judgements, physical measurements, or fast, randomized approximations to exact distances. A naive approach to NNSU could employ any standard NNS algorithm and repeatedly query and average results from the stochastic oracle (to reduce noise) whenever it needs a pairwise distance. The problem is that a sufficient number of repeated queries is unknown in advance; e.g., a point maybe distant from all but one other point (crude distance estimates suffice) or it may be close to a large number of other points (accurate estimates are necessary). This paper shows how ideas from cover trees and multi-armed bandits can be leveraged to develop an NNSU algorithm that has optimal dependence on the dataset size and the (unknown)geometry of the dataset.},

In this work, we introduce $q$-paths, a family of paths which is derived from a generalized notion of the mean, includes the geometric and arithmetic mixtures as special cases, and admits a simple closed form involving the deformed logarithm function from nonextensive thermodynamics. Following previous analysis of the geometric path, we interpret our $q$-paths as corresponding to a $q$-exponential family of distributions, and provide a variational representation of intermediate densities as minimizing a mixture of $\alpha$-divergences to the endpoints. We show that small deviations away from the geometric path yield empirical gains for Bayesian inference using Sequential Monte Carlo and generative model evaluation using Annealed Importance Sampling.},

Although we can easily extend SGLD to distributed settings, it suffers from two issues when applied to federated non-IID data. First, the variance of these estimates increases significantly. Second, delaying communication causes the Markov chains to diverge from the true posterior even for very simple models. To alleviate both these problems, we propose conducive gradients, a simple mechanism that combines local likelihood approximations to correct gradient updates. Notably, conducive gradients are easy to compute, and since we only calculate the approximations once, they incur negligible overhead. We apply conducive gradients to distributed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (DSGLD) and call the resulting method federated stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (FSGLD). We demonstrate that our approach can handle delayed communication rounds, converging to the target posterior in cases where DSGLD fails. We also show that FSGLD outperforms DSGLD for non-IID federated data with experiments on metric learning and neural networks.},

To mitigate this issue, it is commonly believed that more training data will eventually help such adversarially robust models generalize better on the benign/unperturbed test data. In this paper, however, we challenge this conventional belief and show that more training data can hurt the generalization of adversarially robust models in the classification problems. We first investigate the Gaussian mixture classification with a linear loss and identify three regimes based on the strength of the adversary. In the weak adversary regime, more data improves the generalization of adversarially robust models. In the medium adversary regime, with more training data, the generalization loss exhibits a double descent curve, which implies the existence of an intermediate stage where more training data hurts the generalization. In the strong adversary regime, more data almost immediately causes the generalization error to increase. Then we move to the analysis of a two-dimensional classification problem with a 0-1 loss. We prove that more data always hurts the generalization performance of adversarially trained models with large perturbations. To complement our theoretical results, we conduct empirical studies on Gaussian mixture classification, support vector machines (SVMs), and linear regression.},

Despite their advantages, such as stability in training, efficient inference, the performance of AE based models has not reached the superior standards of the other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Motivated by this, we examine the effect of the latent prior on the generation quality of deterministic AE models in this paper. Specifically, we consider the class of Generative AE models with deterministic Encoder-Decoder pair (such as Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE), Adversarial Auto-Encoder (AAE)), and show that having a fixed prior distribution, \textit{a priori}, oblivious to the dimensionality of the `true' latent space, will lead to the infeasibility of the optimization problem considered. As a remedy to the issue mentioned above, we introduce an additional state space in the form of flexibly learnable latent priors, in the optimization objective of WAE/AAE. Additionally, we employ a latent-space interpolation based smoothing scheme to address the non-smoothness that may arise from highly flexible priors. We show the efficacy of our proposed models, called FlexAE and FlexAE-SR, through several experiments on multiple datasets, and demonstrate that FlexAE-SR is the new state-of-the-art for the AE based generative models in terms of generation quality as measured by several metrics such as Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Precision/Recall score.

 abstract = {Bayesian phylogenetic inference is often conducted via local or sequential search over topologies and branch lengths using algorithms such as random-walk Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (CSMC). However, when MCMC is used for evolutionary parameter learning, convergence requires long runs with inefficient exploration of the state space. We introduce Variational Combinatorial Sequential Monte Carlo (VCSMC), a powerful framework that establishes variational sequential search to learn distributions over intricate combinatorial structures. We then develop nested CSMC, an efficient proposal distribution for CSMC and prove that nested CSMC is an exact approximation to the (intractable) locally optimal proposal. We use nested CSMC to define a second objective, VNCSMC which yields tighter lower bounds than VCSMC. We show that VCSMC and VNCSMC are computationally efficient and explore higher probability spaces than existing methods on a range of tasks.},

 abstract = {Black-box machine learning models can be extremely accurate. Yet, in critical applications such as in healthcare or justice, if models cannot be explained, domain experts will be reluctant to use them. A common way to explain a black-box model is to approximate it by a simpler model such as a decision tree. In this paper, we propose a co-learning framework to learn decision rules as explanations of black-box models through knowledge distillation and simultaneously constrain the black-box model by these explanations; all of this in a differentiable manner. To do so, we introduce the soft truncated Gaussian mixture analysis (STruGMA), a probabilistic model which encapsulates hyper-rectangle decision rules. With STruGMA, global explanations can be extracted by any rule learner such as decision lists, sets or trees. We provide evidences through experiments that our framework can globally explain differentiable black-box models such as neural networks. In particular, the explanation fidelity is increased, while the accuracy of the models is marginally impacted.},

Deep hybrid models that marry the predictive power of neural networks with physical simulators such as differential equations, are starting to drive advances in such applications. The task of modeling not just the observations but the hidden dynamics that are captured by the measurements poses interesting statistical/computational questions. We propose a probabilistic model called ME-NODE to incorporate (fixed + random) mixed effects for analyzing such panel data. We show that our model can be derived using smooth approximations of SDEs provided by the Wong-Zakai theorem. We then derive Evidence Based Lower Bounds for ME-NODE, and develop (efficient) training algorithms using MC based sampling methods and numerical ODE solvers. We demonstrate ME-NODE's utility on tasks spanning the spectrum from simulations and toy data to real longitudinal 3D imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease (AD) study, and study its performance in terms of accuracy of reconstruction for interpolation, uncertainty estimates and personalized prediction.},

 abstract = {Uncertainty estimation in deep models is essential in many real-world applications and has benefited from developments over the last several years. Recent evidence suggests that existing solutions dependent on simple Gaussian formulations may not be sufficient. However, moving to other distributions necessitates Monte Carlo (MC) sampling to estimate quantities such as the KL divergence: it could be expensive and scales poorly as the dimensions of both the input data and the model grow. This is directly related to the structure of the computation graph, which can grow linearly as a function of the number of MC samples needed. Here, we construct a framework to describe these computation graphs, and identify probability families where the graph size can be independent or only weakly dependent on the number of MC samples. These families correspond directly to large classes of distributions. Empirically, we can run a much larger number of iterations for MC approximations for larger architectures used in computer vision with gains in performance measured in confident accuracy, stability of training, memory and training time.},

 abstract = {Multi-source domain adaptation (DA) is more challenging than conventional DA because the knowledge is transferred from several source domains to a target domain. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model for multi-source DA using the theory of optimal transport and imitation learning. More specifically, our approach consists of two cooperative agents: a teacher classifier and a student classifier. The teacher classifier is a combined expert that leverages knowledge of domain experts that can be theoretically guaranteed to handle perfectly source examples, while the student classifier acting on the target domain tries to imitate the teacher classifier acting on the source domains. Our rigorous theory developed based on optimal transport makes this cross-domain imitation possible and also helps to mitigate not only the data shift but also the label shift, which are inherently thorny issues in DA research. We conduct comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the merit of our approach and its optimal transport based imitation learning viewpoint. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for multi-source domain adaptation including Digits-five, Office-Caltech10, and Office-31 to the best of our knowledge.},

 abstract = {Information-based Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms have achieved state-of-the-art performance in optimizing a black-box objective function. However, they usually require several approximations or simplifying assumptions (without clearly understanding their effects on the BO performance) and/or their generalization to batch BO is computationally unwieldy, especially with an increasing batch size. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents a novel trusted-maximizers entropy search (TES) acquisition function: It measures how much an input query contributes to the information gain on the maximizer over a finite set of trusted maximizers, i.e., inputs optimizing functions that are sampled from the Gaussian process posterior belief of the objective function. Evaluating TES requires either only a stochastic approximation with sampling or a deterministic approximation with expectation propagation, both of which are investigated and empirically evaluated using synthetic benchmark objective functions and real-world optimization problems, e.g., hyperparameter tuning of a convolutional neural network and synthesizing 'physically realizable' faces to fool a black-box face recognition system. Though TES can naturally be generalized to a batch variant with either approximation, the latter is amenable to be scaled to a much larger batch size in our experiments.},

The first computationally tractable definition of RPCA decomposes a data matrix into a low-rank and a sparse component. The low-rank component represents the principal components, while the sparse component accounts for the data corruption. Previous works consider the corruption of individual entries or whole columns of the data matrix. In contrast, we consider a more general form of data corruption that affects groups of measurements. We show that the decomposition approach remains computationally tractable and allows the exact recovery of the decomposition when only the corrupted data matrix is given.

One crucial aspect of these models is an expectation that, because they are treated as Gaussian process models optimized using the marginal likelihood, they are protected from overfitting. However, we identify situations where this is not the case. We explore this behavior, explain its origins and consider how it applies to real datasets. Through careful experimentation on the UCI, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace datasets, we find that the overfitting from overparameterized maximum marginal likelihood, in which the model is "somewhat Bayesian", can in certain scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian at all. We explain how and when DKL can still be successful by investigating optimization dynamics. We also find that failures of DKL can be rectified by a fully Bayesian treatment, which leads to the desired performance improvements over standard neural networks and Gaussian processes.},

 abstract = {The sample efficiency of Bayesian optimization(BO) is often boosted by Gaussian Process(GP) surrogate models. However, on mixed variable spaces, surrogate models other than GPs are prevalent, mainly due to the lack of kernels which can model complex dependencies across different types of variables. In this paper, we propose the frequency modulated (FM) kernel flexibly modeling dependencies among different types of variables, so that BO can enjoy the further improved sample efficiency. The FM kernel uses distances on continuous variables to modulate the graph Fourier spectrum derived from discrete variables. However, the frequency modulation does not always define a kernel with the similarity measure behavior which returns higher values for pairs of more similar points. Therefore, we specify and prove conditions for FM kernels to be positive definite and to exhibit the similarity measure behavior. In experiments, we demonstrate the improved sample efficiency of GP BO using FM kernels (BO-FM).On synthetic problems and hyperparameter optimization problems, BO-FM outperforms competitors consistently. Also, the importance of the frequency modulation principle is empirically demonstrated on the same problems. On joint optimization of neural architectures and SGD hyperparameters, BO-FM outperforms competitors including Regularized evolution(RE) and BOHB. Remarkably, BO-FM performs better even than RE and BOHB using three times as many evaluations.},

 abstract = {The principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty is prevalent throughout sequential decision making problems such as multi-armed bandits and reinforcement learning (RL). To be successful, an optimistic RL algorithm must over-estimate the true value function (optimism) but not by so much that it is inaccurate (estimation error). In the tabular setting, many state-of-the-art methods produce the required optimism through approaches which are intractable when scaling to deep RL. We re-interpret these scalable optimistic model-based algorithms as solving a tractable noise augmented MDP. This formulation achieves a competitive regret bound: $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}( |\mathcal{S}|H\sqrt{|\mathcal{A}| T } )$ when augmenting using Gaussian noise, where $T$ is the total number of environment steps. We also explore how this trade-off changes in the deep RL setting, where we show empirically that estimation error is significantly more troublesome. However, we also show that if this error is reduced, optimistic model-based RL algorithms can match state-of-the-art performance in continuous control problems.},

 abstract = {The goal of fairness in classification is to learn a classifier that does not discriminate against groups of individuals based on sensitive attributes, such as race and gender. One approach to designing fair algorithms is to use relaxations of fairness notions as regularization terms or in a constrained optimization problem. We observe that the hyperbolic tangent function can approximate the indicator function. We leverage this property to define a differentiable relaxation that approximates fairness notions provably better than existing relaxations. In addition, we propose a model-agnostic multi-objective architecture that can simultaneously optimize for multiple fairness notions and multiple sensitive attributes and supports all statistical parity-based notions of fairness. We use our relaxation with the multi-objective architecture to learn fair classifiers. Experiments on public datasets show that our method suffers a significantly lower loss of accuracy than current debiasing algorithms relative to the unconstrained model.},

 abstract = {Neural Processes (NPs) are a family of conditional generative models that are able to model a distribution over functions, in a way that allows them to perform predictions at test time conditioned on a number of context points. A recent addition to this family, Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNP), have shown remarkable improvement in performance over prior art, but we find that they sometimes struggle to generalize when applied to time series data. In particular, they are not robust to distribution shifts and fail to extrapolate observed patterns into the future. By incorporating a Gaussian Process into the model, we are able to remedy this and at the same time improve performance within distribution. As an added benefit, the Gaussian Process reintroduces the possibility to sample from the model, a key feature of other members in the NP family.},

 abstract = {Trustworthy deployment of ML models requires a proper measure of uncertainty, especially in safety-critical applications. We focus on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for classification problems via two avenues --- prediction sets using conformal prediction and calibration of probabilistic predictors by post-hoc binning --- since these possess distribution-free guarantees for i.i.d. data. Two common ways of generalizing beyond the i.i.d. setting include handling covariate and label shift. Within the context of distribution-free UQ, the former has already received attention, but not the latter. It is known that label shift hurts prediction, and we first argue that it also hurts UQ, by showing degradation in coverage and calibration. Piggybacking on recent progress in addressing label shift (for better prediction), we examine the right way to achieve UQ by reweighting the aforementioned conformal and calibration procedures whenever some unlabeled data from the target distribution is available. We examine these techniques theoretically in a distribution-free framework and demonstrate their excellent practical performance.},

To tackle this, we propose competitive policy optimization (CoPO), a novel policy gradient approach that exploits the game-theoretic nature of competitive games to derive policy updates. Motivated by the competitive gradient optimization method, we derive a bilinear approximation of the game objective. In contrast, off-the-shelf policy gradient methods utilize only linear approximations, and hence do not capture interactions among the players. We instantiate CoPO in two ways:(i) competitive policy gradient, and (ii) trust-region competitive policy optimization. We theoretically study these methods, and empirically investigate their behavior on a set of comprehensive, yet challenging, competitive games. We observe that they provide stable optimization, convergence to sophisticated strategies, and higher scores when played against baseline policy gradient methods.},

 abstract = {Generating succinct summaries or \textit{sketches} of massive data streams is becoming increasingly important. Such a task typically requires fast, accurate, and small space algorithms in order to support the downstream applications, mainly in areas such as data analysis, machine learning, and data mining. A fundamental and well-studied problem in this context is that of estimating the frequencies of the items appearing in a data stream. The Count-Min-Sketch~\cite{CMS} and Count-Sketch~\cite{count_sketch} are two known classical algorithms for this purpose. However, a limitation of these techniques is that the variance of their estimate tends to be large. In this work, we address this problem and suggest a technique that reduces the variance in their respective estimates, at the cost of little computational overhead. Our technique relies on the classical Control-Variate trick~\cite{Lavenberg} used for reducing variance in Monte-Carlo simulation. We present a theoretical analysis of our proposal by carefully choosing the control variates and complement them with experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets.},

However, majority of the developments focus on performance of GANs on balanced datasets. We find that the existing GANs and their training regimes which work well on balanced datasets fail to be effective in case of imbalanced (i.e. long-tailed) datasets. In this work we introduce a novel theoretically motivated Class Balancing regularizer for training GANs. Our regularizer makes use of the knowledge from a pre-trained classifier to ensure balanced learning of all the classes in the dataset. This is achieved via modelling the effective class frequency based on the exponential forgetting observed in neural networks and encouraging the GAN to focus on underrepresented classes. We demonstrate the utility of our regularizer in learning representations for long-tailed distributions via achieving better performance than existing approaches over multiple datasets. Specifically, when applied to an unconditional GAN, it improves the FID from $13.03$ to $9.01$ on the long-tailed iNaturalist-$2019$ dataset.},

They provide a formal recipe for how to move between the different joint distributions and make predictions about the variables upon intervening on the system. Yet, it is difficult to formalise how we may change the underlying variables used to describe the system, say moving from fine-grained to coarse-grained variables. Here, we argue that compositionality is a desideratum for such model transformations and the associated errors: When abstracting a reference model M iteratively, first obtaining M' and then further simplifying that to obtain M'', we expect the composite transformation from M to M'' to exist and its error to be bounded by the errors incurred by each individual transformation step. Category theory, the study of mathematical objects via compositional transformations between them, offers a natural language to develop our framework for model transformations and abstractions. We introduce a category of finite interventional causal models and, leveraging theory of enriched categories, prove the desired compositionality properties for our framework.},

Fitting its parameters via maximum likelihood (ML) is challenging since the computation of the marginal likelihood involves an intractable integral over the latent space; thus the VAE is trained instead by maximizing a variational lower bound. Here, we develop a ML training scheme for VAEs by introducing unbiased estimators of the log-likelihood gradient. We obtain the estimators by augmenting the latent space with a set of importance samples, similarly to the importance weighted auto-encoder (IWAE), and then constructing a Markov chain Monte Carlo coupling procedure on this augmented space. We provide the conditions under which the estimators can be computed in finite time and with finite variance. We show experimentally that VAEs fitted with unbiased estimators exhibit better predictive performance.},

However, a generalization theory for the neural networks has not been well developed, because several essential factors for the theory, such as network size and margin distribution, are not deeply connected to the invariance and equivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization error bound for invariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the effect of invariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of a \textit{quotient feature space}, which measures the effect of group actions for the properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature spaces can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that the invariance and equivariance significantly improve the leading term of the bound. We apply our result to specific invariant and equivariant networks, such as DeepSets (Zaheer et al. (2017)), and show that their generalization bound is considerably improved by $\sqrt{n!}$, where $n!$ is the number of permutations. We also discuss the expressive power of invariant DNNs and show that they can achieve an optimal approximation rate. Our experimental result supports our theoretical claims.},

Lately, neural methods have shown success in exploiting stock affecting signals from textual data across news and tweets to forecast stock performance. However, the dynamic, stochastic, and variably influential nature of text and prices makes it difficult to train neural stock trading models, limiting predictive performance and profits. To transcend this limitation, we propose a novel multi-modal curriculum learning approach: FinCLASS, which evaluates stock affecting signals via entropy-based heuristics and measures their linguistic and price-based complexities in a time-aware, hierarchical fashion. We show that training financial models can benefit by exposing neural networks to easier examples of stock affecting signals early during the training phase, before introducing samples having more complex linguistic and price-based temporal variations. Through experiments on benchmark English tweets and Chinese financial news spanning two major indexes and four global markets, we show how FinCLASS outperforms state-of-the-art across financial tasks of stock movement prediction, volatility regression, and profit generation. Through ablative and qualitative experiments, we set the case for FinCLASS as a generalizable framework for developing natural language-centric neural models for financial tasks.},

In this work, we propose a novel Bayesian recursion to efficiently infer a posterior distribution over discrete latent variables from a sequence of observations in an online manner, assuming a Chinese Restaurant Process prior on the sequence of latent variables. Our recursive filter, which we call the Recursive Chinese Restaurant Process (R-CRP), has quasilinear average time complexity and logarithmic average space complexity in the total number of observations.

The goal of this work is to build a general purpose classification algorithm, which is able to abstain from prediction, while avoiding disparate impact. We formalize this problem as risk minimization under fairness and abstention constraints for which we derive the form of the optimal classifier. Building on this result, we propose a post-processing classification algorithm, which is able to modify any off-the-shelf score-based classifier using only unlabeled sample. We establish finite sample risk, fairness, and abstention guarantees for the proposed algorithm. In particular, it is shown that fairness and abstention constraints can be achieved independently from the initial classifier as long as sufficiently many unlabeled data is available. The risk guarantee is established in terms of the quality of the initial classifier. Our post-processing scheme reduces to a sparse linear program allowing for an efficient implementation, which we provide. Finally, we validate our method empirically showing that moderate abstention rates allow to bypass the risk-fairness trade-off.},

To motivate the proposed approach, we provide theoretical connections between gradients' geometrical properties and local minima of the loss function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms prior approaches in detecting OOD data and adversarial attacks, including state-of-the-art and adaptive attacks.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the probability distributions of penultimate activations of classification networks. Specifically, we show that, when a classification network is trained with the cross-entropy loss, its final classification layer forms a Generative-Discriminative pair with a generative classifier based on a specific distribution of penultimate activations. More importantly, the distribution is parameterized by the weights of the final fully-connected layer, and can be considered as a generative model that synthesizes the penultimate activations without feeding input data. We empirically demonstrate that this generative model enables stable knowledge distillation in the presence of domain shift, and can also transfer knowledge from a classifier to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for class-conditional image generation.},

Building on recent work leveraging the local curvature of DNNs to reason about epistemic uncertainty, we propose Sketching Curvature of OoD Detection (SCOD), an architecture-agnostic framework for equipping any trained DNN with a task-relevant epistemic uncertainty estimate. Offline, given a trained model and its training data, SCOD employs tools from matrix sketching to tractably compute a low-rank approximation of the Fisher information matrix, which characterizes which directions in the weight space are most influential on the predictions over the training data. Online, we estimate uncertainty by measuring how much perturbations orthogonal to these directions can alter predictions at a new test input. We apply SCOD to pre-trained networks of varying architectures on several tasks, ranging from regression to classification. We demonstrate that SCOD achieves comparable or better OoD detection performance with lower computational burden relative to existing baselines.},

However, the theoretical characterisation of the efficacy of such algorithms has remained an under-explored area. We introduce a novel algorithm for G-SSL, CSX, whose objective function extends those of Label Propagation and Expander, two popular G-SSL algorithms. We provide data-dependent generalisation error bounds for all three aforementioned algorithms when they are applied to graphs drawn from a partially labelled extension of a versatile latent space graph generative model. The bounds we obtain enable us to characterise the predictive performance as measured by accuracy in terms of homophily and label quantity. Building on this we develop a key notion of GLM-safety which enables us to compare G-SSL algorithms on the basis of the range of graphs on which they obtain a guaranteed accuracy. We show that the proposed algorithm CSX has a better GLM-safety profile than Label Propagation and Expander while achieving comparable or better accuracy on synthetic as well as real-world benchmark networks.},

 abstract = {The defining challenge for causal inference from observational data is the presence of `confounders', covariates that affect both treatment assignment and the outcome. To address this challenge, practitioners collect and adjust for the covariates, hoping that they adequately correct for confounding. However, including every observed covariate in the adjustment runs the risk of including `bad controls', variables that induce bias when they are conditioned on. The problem is that we do not always know which variables in the covariate set are safe to adjust for and which are not. To address this problem, we develop Nearly Invariant Causal Estimation (NICE). NICE uses invariant risk minimization (IRM) [Arj19] to learn a representation of the covariates that, under some assumptions, strips out bad controls but preserves sufficient information to adjust for confounding. Adjusting for the learned representation, rather than the covariates themselves, avoids the induced bias and provides valid causal inferences. We evaluate NICE on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data. When the covariates contain unknown collider variables and other bad controls, NICE performs better than adjusting for all the covariates.},

Deep generative modeling has emerged as a dominant paradigm to model complex data distributions without labels. However, prior work has shown that generative models tend to assign higher likelihoods to OOD samples compared to the data distribution on which they were trained. First, we propose Adversarial Mirrored Autoencoder (AMA), a variant of Adversarial Autoencoder, which uses a mirrored Wasserstein loss in the discriminator to enforce better semantic-level reconstruction. We also propose a latent space regularization to learn a compact manifold for in-distribution samples. The use of AMA produces better feature representations that improve anomaly detection performance. Second, we put forward an alternative measure of anomaly score to replace the reconstruction-based metric which has been traditionally used in generative model-based anomaly detection methods. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection on several OOD detection benchmarks.},

 abstract = {To capture the slowly time-varying spectral content of real-world time-series, a common paradigm is to partition the data into approximately stationary intervals and perform inference in the time-frequency domain. However, this approach lacks a corresponding nonstationary time-domain generative model for the entire data and thus, time-domain inference occurs in each interval separately. This results in distortion/discontinuity around interval boundaries and can consequently lead to erroneous inferences based on any quantities derived from the posterior, such as the phase. To address these shortcomings, we propose the Piecewise Locally Stationary Oscillation (PLSO) model for decomposing time-series data with slowly time-varying spectra into several oscillatory, piecewise-stationary processes. PLSO, as a nonstationary time-domain generative model, enables inference on the entire time-series without boundary effects and simultaneously provides a characterization of its time-varying spectral properties. We also propose a novel two-stage inference algorithm that combines Kalman theory and an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm. We demonstrate these points through experiments on simulated data and real neural data from the rat and the human brain.},

In structured systems that transition between qualitatively different states in discrete time steps, such an approach is deficient on two fronts. First, time-varying variables may have state-specific causal relationships that need to be captured. Second, an intervention can result in state transitions downstream of the intervention different from those actually observed in the data. In other words, interventions may counterfactually alter the subsequent temporal evolution of the system. We introduce a generalization of causal graphical models, Path Dependent Structural Equation Models (PDSEMs), that can describe such systems.

 abstract = {Structural causal models postulate noisy functional relations among a set of interacting variables. The causal structure underlying each such model is naturally represented by a directed graph whose edges indicate for each variable which other variables it causally depends upon. Under a number of different model assumptions, it has been shown that this causal graph and, thus also, causal effects are identifiable from mere observational data. For these models, practical algorithms have been devised to learn the graph. Moreover, when the graph is known, standard techniques may be used to give estimates and confidence intervals for causal effects. We argue, however, that a two-step method that first learns a graph and then treats the graph as known yields confidence intervals that are overly optimistic and can drastically fail to account for the uncertain causal structure. To address this issue we lay out a framework based on test inversion that allows us to give confidence regions for total causal effects that capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure and numerical size of nonzero effects. Our ideas are developed in the context of bivariate linear causal models with homoscedastic errors, but as we exemplify they are generalizable to larger systems as well as other settings such as, in particular, linear non-Gaussian models.},

However, existing GP approximations do not simultaneously support large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series which is a hallmark of many applications. 
Pseudo-point approximations, one of the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs to large data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid spatial data. However, they cannot handle long temporal observation horizons effectively reverting to cubic computational scaling in the time dimension. State space GP approximations are well suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear complexity in the number of temporal observations, but have a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle off-the-grid spatial data. 
In this work we show that there is a simple and elegant way to combine pseudo-point methods with the state space GP approximation framework to get the best of both worlds. The approach hinges on a surprising conditional independence property which applies to space--time separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more scalable and applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal problems than either method on its own.},

To mitigate this problem, the CVaR can be estimated by extrapolating above a lower threshold than the VaR using a generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), which is often referred to as the peaks-over-threshold (POT) approach. This method often requires a very high threshold to fit well, leading to high variance in estimation, and can induce significant bias if the threshold is chosen too low. In this paper, we derive a new expression for the GPD approximation error of the CVaR, a bias term induced by the choice of threshold, as well as a bias correction method for the estimated GPD parameters. This leads to the derivation of a new estimator for the CVaR that we prove to be asymptotically unbiased. In a practical setting, we show through experiments that our estimator provides a significant performance improvement compared with competing CVaR estimators in finite samples. As a consequence of our bias correction method, it is also shown that a much lower threshold can be selected without introducing significant bias. This allows a larger portion of data to be be used in CVaR estimation compared with the typical POT approach, leading to more stable estimates. As secondary results, a new estimator for a second-order parameter of heavy-tailed distributions is derived, as well as a confidence interval for the CVaR which enables quantifying the level of variability in our estimator.},

 abstract = {Sparse Gaussian processes and various extensions thereof are enabled through inducing points, that simultaneously bottleneck the predictive capacity and act as the main contributor towards model complexity. However, the number of inducing points is generally not associated with uncertainty which prevents us from applying the apparatus of Bayesian reasoning for identifying an appropriate trade-off. In this work we place a point process prior on the inducing points and approximate the associated posterior through stochastic variational inference. By letting the prior encourage a moderate number of inducing points, we enable the model to learn which and how many points to utilise. We experimentally show that fewer inducing points are preferred by the model as the points become less informative, and further demonstrate how the method can be employed in deep Gaussian processes and latent variable modelling.},

 abstract = {A crucial requirement for reliable deployment of deep learning models for safety-critical applications is the ability to identify out-of-distribution (OOD) data points, samples which differ from the training data and on which a model might underperform. Previous work has attempted to tackle this problem using uncertainty estimation techniques. However, there is empirical evidence that a large family of these techniques do not detect OOD reliably in classification tasks. 
This paper gives a theoretical explanation for said experimental findings and illustrates it on synthetic data. We prove that such techniques are not able to reliably identify OOD samples in a classification setting, since their level of confidence is generalized to unseen areas of the feature space. This result stems from the interplay between the representation of ReLU networks as piece-wise affine transformations, the saturating nature of activation functions like softmax, and the most widely-used uncertainty metrics.},

Modern Bayesian models, however, typically involve intractable posteriors that are approximated with, potentially crude, surrogates. This difficulty has engendered loss-calibrated techniques that aim to learn posterior approximations that favor high-utility decisions. In this paper, focusing on Bayesian neural networks, we develop methods for correcting approximate posterior predictive distributions encouraging them to prefer high-utility decisions. In contrast to previous work, our approach is agnostic to the choice of the approximate inference algorithm, allows for efficient test time decision making through amortization, and empirically produces higher quality decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through controlled experiments spanning a diversity of tasks and datasets.},

Especially, there exists few effective defense method against the successful synonym substitution based attacks that preserve the syntactic structure and semantic information of the original text while fooling the deep learning models. We contribute in this direction and propose a novel adversarial defense method called Synonym Encoding Method (SEM). Specifically, SEM inserts an encoder before the input layer of the target model to map each cluster of synonyms to a unique encoding and trains the model to eliminate possible adversarial perturbations without modifying the network architecture or adding extra data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEM can effectively defend the current synonym substitution based attacks and block the transferability of adversarial examples. SEM is also easy and efficient to scale to large models and big datasets.},

 abstract = {Despite their numerous successes, there are many scenarios where adversarial risk metrics do not provide an appropriate measure of robustness. For example, test-time perturbations may occur in a probabilistic manner rather than being generated by an explicit adversary, while the poor train--test generalization of adversarial metrics can limit their usage to simple problems. Motivated by this, we develop a probabilistic robust risk framework, the statistically robust risk (SRR), which considers pointwise corruption distributions, as opposed to worst-case adversaries. The SRR provides a distinct and complementary measure of robust performance, compared to natural and adversarial risk. We show that the SRR admits estimation and training schemes which are as simple and efficient as for the natural risk: these simply require noising the inputs, but with a principled derivation for exactly how and why this should be done. Furthermore, we demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that it can provide superior generalization performance compared with adversarial risks, enabling application to high-dimensional datasets.},

A variety of graph neural network (GNN) based approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, which typically determine output labels through feature aggregation. This can be problematic, as it implies conditional independence of output nodes given hidden representations, despite their direct connections in the graph. To learn the direct influence among output nodes in a graph, we propose the Explicit Pairwise Factorized Graph Neural Network (EPFGNN), which models the whole graph as a partially observed Markov Random Field. It contains explicit pairwise factors to model output-output relations and uses a GNN backbone to model input-output relations. To balance model complexity and expressivity, the pairwise factors have a shared component and a separate scaling coefficient for each edge. We apply the EM algorithm to train our model, and utilize a star-shaped piecewise likelihood for the tractable surrogate objective. We conduct experiments on various datasets, which shows that our model can effectively improve the performance for semi-supervised node classification on graphs.},

In this article, an expanded version of a paper originally presented at the 37th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (Watson et al., 2021), we attempt to fill this gap. Building on work in logic, probability, and causality, we establish the central role of necessity and sufficiency in XAI, unifying seemingly disparate methods in a single formal framework. We propose a novel formulation of these concepts, and demonstrate its advantages over leading alternatives. We present a sound and complete algorithm for computing explanatory factors with respect to a given context and set of agentive preferences, allowing users to identify necessary and sufficient conditions for desired outcomes at minimal cost. Experiments on real and simulated data confirm our method’s competitive performance against state of the art XAI tools on a diverse array of tasks.},

 abstract = {Neural architecture search (NAS) has seen a steep rise in interest over the last few years. Many algorithms for NAS consist of searching through a space of architectures by iteratively choosing an architecture, evaluating its performance by training it, and using all prior evaluations to come up with the next choice. The evaluation step is noisy - the final accuracy varies based on the random initialization of the weights. Prior work has focused on devising new search algorithms to handle this noise, rather than quantifying or understanding the level of noise in architecture evaluations. In this work, we show that (1) the simplest hill-climbing algorithm is a powerful baseline for NAS, and (2), when the noise in popular NAS benchmark datasets is reduced to a minimum, hill-climbing to outperforms many popular state-of-the-art algorithms. We further back up this observation by showing that the number of local minima is substantially reduced as the noise decreases, and by giving a theoretical characterization of the performance of local search in NAS. Based on our findings, for NAS research we suggest (1) using local search as a baseline, and (2) denoising the training pipeline when possible.},

In 1992, Dor and Tarsi proposed an algorithm with time complexity $O(n^4)$, which has been widely used in causal theory and practice so far. It is a long-standing open question whether an extension can be computed faster and, in particular, it was conjectured that a linear-time method may exist. The main contributions of our work are two-fold: Firstly, we propose a new algorithm for the extension problem for PDAGs which runs in time $O(n^3)$; secondly, we show that, under a computational intractability assumption, our cubic algorithm is optimal. Thus, our impossibility result disproves the conjecture that a linear-time method exists. Based on these results, we present a full complexity landscape for finding extensions in various causal graphical models. We extend the techniques to recognition problems and apply them to design an effective algorithm for closing a PDAG under the orientation rules of Meek.},

Here policies are optimized by performing online learning on a sequence of loss functions that encourage the learner to mimic expert actions, and if the online learning has no regret, the agent can provably learn an expert-like policy. Online IL has demonstrated empirical successes in many applications and interestingly, its policy improvement speed observed in practice is usually much faster than existing theory suggests. In this work, we provide an explanation of this phenomenon. Let $\xi$ denote the policy class bias and assume the online IL loss functions are convex, smooth, and non-negative. We prove that, after $N$ rounds of online IL with stochastic feedback, the policy improves in $\tilde{O}(1/N + \sqrt{\xi/N})$ in both expectation and high probability. In other words, we show that adopting a sufficiently expressive policy class in online IL has two benefits: both the policy improvement speed increases and the performance bias decreases.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems are often designed based on a collaborative filtering approach, where user preferences are predicted by modelling interactions between users and items. Many common approaches to solve the collaborative filtering task are based on learning representations of users and items, including simple matrix factorization, Gaussian process latent variable models, and neural-network based embeddings. While matrix factorization approaches fail to model nonlinear relations, neural networks can potentially capture such complex relations with unprecedented predictive power and are highly scalable. However, neither of them is able to model predictive uncertainties. In contrast, Gaussian Process based models can generate a predictive distribution, but cannot scale to large amounts of data. In this manuscript, we propose a novel approach combining the representation learning paradigm of collaborative filtering with multi-output Gaussian processes in a joint framework to generate uncertainty-aware recommendations. We introduce an efficient strategy for model training and inference, resulting in a model that scales to very large and sparse datasets and achieves competitive performance in terms of classical metrics quantifying the reconstruction error. In addition to accurately predicting user preferences, our model also provides meaningful uncertainty estimates about that prediction.},

 abstract = {We develop a mathematical framework for solving multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) problems based on a type of policy gradient method. The goal in MTRL is to learn a common policy that operates effectively in different environments; these environments have similar (or overlapping) state spaces, but have different rewards and dynamics. We highlight two fundamental challenges in MTRL that are not present in its single task counterpart, and illustrate them with simple examples. We then develop a decentralized entropy-regularized policy gradient method for solving the MTRL problem, and study its finite-time convergence rate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a series of numerical experiments. These experiments range from small-scale "GridWorld" problems that readily demonstrate the trade-offs involved in multi-task learning to large-scale problems, where common policies are learned to navigate an airborne drone in multiple (simulated) environments.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present a non-parametric structured latent variable model for image generation, called NP-DRAW, which sequentially draws on a latent canvas in a part-by-part fashion and then decodes the image from the canvas. Our key contributions are as follows. 1) We propose a non-parametric prior distribution over the appearance of image parts so that the latent variable ``what-to-draw'' per step becomes a categorical random variable. This improves the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in the literature. 2) We model the sequential dependency structure of parts via a Transformer, which is more powerful and easier to train compared to RNNs used in the literature. 3) We propose an effective heuristic parsing algorithm to pre-train the prior. Experiments on MNIST, Omniglot, CIFAR-10, and CelebA show that our method significantly outperforms previous structured image models like DRAW and AIR and is competitive to other generic generative models. Moreover, we show that our model's inherent compositionality and interpretability bring significant benefits in the low-data learning regime and latent space editing.

Network compression aims to alleviate this issue by training compact models with comparable performance. However, existing compression techniques either entail dedicated expert design or compromise with a moderate performance drop. In this paper, we propose a novel structured sparsification method for efficient network compression. The proposed method automatically induces structured sparsity on the convolutional weights, thereby facilitating the implementation of the compressed model with the highly-optimized group convolution. We further address the problem of inter-group communication with a learnable channel shuffle mechanism. The proposed approach can be easily applied to compress many network architectures with a negligible performance drop. Extensive experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our approach gives a competitive performance against the recent network compression counterparts with a sound accuracy-complexity trade-off.},

We establish nontrivial lower complexity bounds of $\Omega(\sqrt{\kappa}\Delta L\epsilon^{-2})$ and $\Omega(n+\sqrt{n\kappa}\Delta L\epsilon^{-2})$ for the two settings, respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number, $L$ is the smoothness constant, and $\Delta$ is the initial gap. Our result reveals substantial gaps between these limits and best-known upper bounds in the literature. To close these gaps, we introduce a generic acceleration scheme that deploys existing gradient-based methods to solve a sequence of crafted strongly-convex-strongly-concave subproblems. In the general setting, the complexity of our proposed algorithm nearly matches the lower bound; in particular, it removes an additional poly-logarithmic dependence on accuracy present in previous works. In the averaged smooth finite-sum setting, our proposed algorithm improves over previous algorithms by providing a nearly-tight dependence on the condition number.},

 abstract = {Convex clustering has drawn recent attention because of its competitive performance and nice property to guarantee global optimality. However, convex clustering is infeasible due to its high computational cost for large-scale data sets. We propose a novel method to solve the L1 fusion convex clustering problem by dynamic programming. We develop the Convex clustering Path Algorithm In Near-linear Time (C-PAINT) algorithm to construct the solution path efficiently. The proposed C-PAINT yields the exact solution while other general solvers for convex problems applied in the convex clustering depend on tuning parameters such as step size and threshold, and it usually takes many iterations to converge. Including a sorting process that almost takes no time in practice, the main part of the algorithm takes only linear time. Thus, C-PAINT has superior scalability comparing to other state-of-art algorithms. Moreover, C-PAINT enables the path visualization of clustering solutions for large data. In particular, experiments show our proposed method can solve the convex clustering with 10^7 data points in two minutes. We demonstrate the proposed method using both synthetic data and real data. Our algorithms are implemented in the dpcc R package.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of minimizing multi-modal loss functions with a large number of local optima. Since the local gradient points to the direction of the steepest slope in an infinitesimal neighborhood, an optimizer guided by the local gradient is often trapped in local optima. To address this issue, we develop a nonlocal gradient to skip small local optima and capture major structures of the lossâ€™s landscape in black-box optimization. The nonlocal gradient is defined by a directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach, so we refer to our nonlocal gradient as DGS gradient. The key idea of DGS is to conducts 1D nonlocal exploration with a large radius along $d$ orthogonal directions in $R^d$, each of which defines a nonlocal directional derivative as a 1D integral. Such long-range exploration enables the DGS gradient to skip small local optima. The $d$ directional derivatives are then assembled to form the nonlocal gradient. We use the Gauss-Hermite (GH) quadrature rule to approximate the $d$ 1D integrals to obtain an accurate estimator. The superior performance of our method is demonstrated in three sets of examples, including benchmark functions for global optimization, and two real-world scientific problems.},

Conditional density models f(y|x), where x represents potentially high-dimensional features, are an integral part of uncertainty quantification in prediction and Bayesian inference. However, it is challenging to assess conditional density estimates and gain insight into modes of failure. While existing diagnostic tools can determine whether an approximated conditional density is compatible overall with a data sample, they lack a principled framework for identifying, locating, and interpreting the nature of statistically significant discrepancies over the entire feature space. In this paper, we present rigorous and easy-to-interpret diagnostics such as (i) the Coverage Test (LCT), which distinguishes an arbitrarily misspecified model from the true conditional density of the sample, and (ii) Amortized Local P-P plots (ALP) which can quickly provide interpretable graphical summaries of distributional differences at any location x in the feature space. Our validation procedures scale to high dimensions and can potentially adapt to any type of data at hand. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LCT and ALP through a simulated experiment and applications to prediction and parameter inference for image data.},

 abstract = {Few-shot learning ability is heavily desired for machine intelligence. By meta-learning a model initialization from training tasks with fast adaptation ability to new tasks, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) has achieved remarkable success in a number of few-shot learning applications. However, theoretical understandings on the learning ability of MAML remain absent yet, hindering developing new and more advanced meta learning methods in a principle way. In this work, we solve this problem by theoretically justifying the fast adaptation capability of MAML when applied to new tasks. Specifically, we prove that the learnt meta-initialization can quickly adapt to new tasks with only a few steps of gradient descent. This result, for the first time, explicitly reveals the benefits of the unique designs in MAML. Then we propose a theory-inspired task similarity aware MAML which clusters tasks into multiple groups according to the estimated optimal model parameters and learns group-specific initializations. The proposed method improves upon MAML by speeding up the adaptation and giving stronger few-shot learning ability. Experimental results on the few-shot classification tasks testify its advantages. TensorFlow code will be released to reproduce our results.},

 abstract = {Program synthesis has emerged as a successful approach to the image parsing task. Most prior works rely on a two-step scheme involving supervised pretraining of a Seq2Seq model with synthetic programs followed by reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning with real reference images. Fully unsupervised approaches promise to train the model directly on the target images without requiring curated pretraining datasets. However, they struggle with the inherent sparsity of meaningful programs in the search space. In this paper, we present the first unsupervised algorithm capable of parsing constructive solid geometry (CSG) images into context-free grammar (CFG) without pretraining via non-differentiable renderer. To tackle the \emph{non-Markovian} sparse reward problem, we combine three key ingredients -- (i) a grammar-encoded tree LSTM ensuring program validity (ii) entropy regularization and (iii) sampling without replacement from the CFG syntax tree. Empirically, our algorithm recovers meaningful programs in large search spaces (up to $3.8 \times 10^{28}$). Further, even though our approach is fully unsupervised, it generalizes better than supervised methods on the synthetic 2D CSG dataset. On the 2D computer aided design (CAD) dataset, our approach significantly outperforms the supervised pretrained model and is competitive to the refined model.},

At the core of our approach is a novel conductance analysis of SGLD using an auxiliary time-reversible Markov Chain. Under certain conditions on the target distribution, we prove that $\tilde O(d^4\epsilon^{-2})$ stochastic gradient evaluations suffice to guarantee $\epsilon$-sampling error in terms of the total variation distance, where $d$ is the problem dimension. This improves existing results on the convergence rate of SGLD (Raginsky et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018). We further show that provided an additional Hessian Lipschitz condition on the log-density function, SGLD is guaranteed to achieve $\epsilon$-sampling error within $\tilde O(d^{15/4}\epsilon^{-3/2})$ stochastic gradient evaluations. Our proof technique provides a new way to study the convergence of Langevin-based algorithms and sheds some light on the design of fast stochastic gradient-based sampling algorithms.},
