In addition to open-source code and protocols, CARLA provides open digital assets (urban layouts, buildings, vehicles) that were created for this purpose and can be used freely. The simulation platform supports flexible specification of sensor suites and environmental conditions. We use CARLA to study the performance of three approaches to autonomous driving: a classic modular pipeline, an end-to-end model trained via imitation learning, and an end-to-end model trained via reinforcement learning. The approaches are evaluated in controlled scenarios of increasing difficulty, and their performance is examined via metrics provided by CARLA, illustrating the platformâs utility for autonomous driving research.}

  abstract = 	 {In recent times, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches have performed exceptionally well in many computer vision related tasks, including classification and segmentation. These approaches have shown that given enough training data and time, they can often perform at a level significantly higher than the alternative methods. However, in the context of robotic learning, it is commonly the case that both time and training data are limited. In this work, we propose a learning approach that is more suitable for robotic learning; it substantially reduces the time required to learn and provides much higher performance when training data is limited. Our method combines random forests with deep convolution networks, leveraging the strengths of both frameworks. We develop a method for generating derivatives from our highly non-linear forest classifier which in turn enables training of the CNN. Furthermore, our method allows leaf distributions in the ensemble classifier to be trained jointly with one another using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), allowing for parallel training of a large number of tree classifiers at once. This results in a drastic increase in training speed. Our model demonstrates significant performance improvements over pure deep learning methods, notably on datasets with limited training data. We apply our method to the outdoor and indoor segmentation datasets of KITTI and NYUv2-40, outperforming multiple pure deep learning methods whilst using a fraction of training time normally required.}

The problem then is deciding when to teach the robot a new skill or when to rely on the robot generalizing its actions. This decision can be made by the robot if it is provided with means to quantify the suitability of its own skill given an unseen task. To this end, we present an algorithm that allows a robot to make active requests to incrementally learn  movement primitives. A movement primitive is learned on a trajectory output by a Gaussian Process. The latter is used as a library of demonstrations that can be extrapolated with confidence margins. This combination not only allows the robot to generalize using as few as a single demonstration but more importantly, to indicate when such generalization can be executed with confidence or not. In experiments, a real robot arm indicates to the user which demonstrations should be provided to increase its repertoire of reaching skills. Experiments will also show that the robot becomes confident in reaching objects for whose demonstrations were never provided, by incrementally learning from the neighboring demonstrations.}

Bayesian Optimization, a sample-efficient optimization framework, has recently been widely applied to address this problem, but further improvements in sample efficiency are needed for practical applicability to real-world robots and high-dimensional controllers. To address this, prior work has proposed using domain expertise for constructing custom distance metrics for locomotion. In this work we show how to learn such a distance metric automatically. We use a neural network to learn an informed distance metric from data obtained in high-fidelity simulations. We conduct experiments on two different controllers and robot architectures. First, we demonstrate improvement in sample efficiency when optimizing a 5-dimensional controller on the ATRIAS robot hardware. We then conduct simulation experiments to optimize a 16-dimensional controller for a 7-link robot model and obtain significant improvements even when optimizing in perturbed environments. This demonstrates that our approach is able to enhance sample efficiency for two different controllers, hence is a fitting candidate for further experiments on hardware in the future.}

Most research on active learning assumes that an agent has access to the entire pool of unlabeled data and can ask for labels of any data points during an initial training phase. However, when incorporated in a larger task, an agent may only be able to query some subset of the unlabeled pool. An agent can also opportunistically query for labels that may be useful in the future, even if they are not immediately relevant. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of opportunistic active learning can improve performance in grounding natural language descriptions of everyday objectsâan important skill for home and office robots. We find, with a real robot in an object identification setting, that inquisitive behaviorâasking users important questions about the meanings of words that may be off-topic for the current dialogâleads to identifying the correct object more often over time.}

In this paper, we explore a general methodology that robots may use to develop and improve strategies for overcoming manipulation tasks associated with appropriately defined loss functions. We focus on the specific task of pouring a liquid from a container (pourer) to another container (receiver) while minimizing the mass of liquid that spills outside the receiver. We present a solution, based on guidance from approximate simulation, that is fast, flexible and adaptable to novel containers as long as their shapes can be sensed. Our key idea is to decouple the optimization of the parameter space of the simulator from the optimization over action space for determining robot control actions. We perform the former in a training (calibration) stage and the latter during run-time (deployment).  For the purpose of this paper we use pouring in both stages, even though separate actions could be chosen. We compare four different strategies for calibration and three different strategies for deployment. Our results demonstrate that fast fluid simulations are effective, even if they are only approximate, in guiding automatic strategies for pouring liquids. }

Our method extends previous work by employing the Wasserstein distance normalized with gradient penalization as a training objective. This enables improved generation from the joint object shape distribution. Our system can also reconstruct 3D shape from 2D images and perform shape completion from occluded 2.5D range scans. We achieve notable quantitative improvements in comparison to existing baselines.}

PVA accommodates algebraic sets as the target subspace through which limitations of other existing approaches is dealt with. PVA power is demonstrated in this paper for learning kinematics of objects, as an important application. PVA takes recorded coordinates of some pre-specified features on the objects as input and outputs a lowest dimensional variety on which the feature coordinates jointly lie. Unlike existing object modeling methods, which require entire trajectories of objects, PVA requires much less information and provides more flexible and generalizable models, namely an analytical algebraic kinematic model of the objects, even in unstructured, uncertain environments. Moreover, it is not restricted to predetermined model templates and is capable of extracting much more general types of models. Besides finding the kinematic model of objects, PVA can be a powerful tool to estimate their corresponding degrees of freedom. PVA computational success depends on exploiting sparsity, in particular algebraic dimension minimization through replacement of intractable $\ell_0$ norm (rank) with tractable $\ell_1$ norm (nuclear norm). Complete characterization of the assumptions under which $\ell_0$ and $\ell_1$ norm minimizations yield virtually the same outcome is introduced as an important open problem in this paper.}

A âventral streamâ recognizes object class while a âdorsal streamâ simultaneously interprets the geometric relationships necessary to execute successful grasps. We leverage the autonomous data collection capabilities of robots to obtain a large self-supervised dataset for training the dorsal stream, and use semi-supervised label propagation to train the ventral stream with only a modest amount of human supervision. We experimentally show that our approach improves upon grasping systems whose components are not learned end-to-end, including a baseline method that uses bounding box detection. Furthermore, we show that jointly training our model with auxiliary data consisting of non-semantic grasping data, as well as semantically labeled images without grasp actions, has the potential to substantially improve semantic grasping performance.}

A known problem with this âoff-policy" approach is that the robotâs errors compound when drifting away from the supervisorâs demonstrations.  On-policy, techniques alleviate this by iteratively collecting corrective actions for the current robot policy. However, these techniques can be difficult for human supervisors, add significant computation burden, and require the robot to visit potentially dangerous states during training.  We propose an off-policy approach that \emphinjects noise into the supervisorâs policy while demonstrating. This forces the supervisor and robot to explore and recover from errors without letting them compound. We propose a new algorithm, DART, that collects demonstrations with injected noise, and optimizes the noise level to approximate the error of the robotâs trained policy during data collection.  We  provide a theoretical analysis to illustrate that DART reduces covariate shift more than Behavior Cloning for a robot with non-zero error. We evaluate DART in two domains: in simulation with an algorithmic supervisor on the MuJoCo locomotive tasks and in physical experiments with human supervisors training a Toyota HSR robot to perform grasping in clutter.  For challenging tasks like Humanoid, DART can be up to $280%$ faster in computation time and only decreases the supervisorâs cumulative reward by $5%$ during training, whereas DAgger executes policies that have $80%$ less cumulative reward than the supervisor.  On the grasping in clutter task, DART obtains on average $62%$ performance increase over Behavior Cloning.}

To this end, we first present a novel and efficient approach to learn goal-oriented time-independent motion models by estimatingÂ \emphboth attractor and dynamic behavior from data guaranteeing stability using linear parameter varyingÂ (LPV) systems.  This method enables learning complex task sequences with hidden Markov modelsÂ (HMMs), where each state/subtask is given by a stable LPV system and where transitions are most likely around the corresponding attractor. We study the dynamics of the HMM-LPV model and propose a motion generation method that guarantees the stability of task sequences. We validate our approach in two sets of demonstrated human motions.}

To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a two-level hierarchical approach, which integrates model-free deep learning and model-based path planning. At the low level, a neural-network motion controller, called the intention-net, is trained end-to-end to provide robust local navigation. The intention-net maps images from a single monocular camera and âintentionsâ directly to robot controls. At the high level, a path planner uses a crude map, e.g., a 2-D floor plan, to compute a path from the robotâs current location to the goal. The planned path provides intentions to the intention-net. Preliminary experiments suggest that the learned motion controller is robust against perceptual uncertainty and by integrating with a path planner, it generalizes effectively to new environments and goals.}

The main incentive of this work is to keep the advantages of model-free Q-learning while minimizing real-world interaction by the employment of a dynamics model learned in parallel. To counteract adverse effects of imaginary rollouts with an inaccurate model, a notion of uncertainty is introduced, to make use of artificial data only in cases of high uncertainty.

We formalize learning from such interactions as a dynamical system in which the task objective has parameters that are part of the hidden state, and physical human interactions are observations about these parameters. We derive an online approximation of the robotâs optimal policy in this system, and test it in a user study.

In practice, however, modelbased RL suffers from various imperfections such as noisy input and output data, delays and unmeasured (latent) states. To achieve higher resilience against such effects, we propose to optimize a generative long-term prediction model directly with respect to the likelihood of observed trajectories as opposed to the common approach of optimizing a dynamics model for one-step-ahead predictions. We evaluate the proposed method on several artificial and real-world benchmark problems and compare it to PILCO, a model-based RL framework, in experiments on a manipulation robot. The results show that the proposed method is competitive compared to state-of-the-art model learning methods. In contrast to these more involved models, our model can directly be employed for policy search and outperforms a baseline method in the robot experiment.}

The progressive net approach is a general framework that enables reuse of everything from low-level visual features to high-level policies for transfer to new tasks, enabling a compositional, yet simple, approach to building complex skills. We present an early demonstration of this approach with a number of experiments in the domain of robot manipulation that focus on bridging the reality gap. Unlike other proposed approaches, our real-world experiments demonstrate successful task learning from raw visual input on a fully actuated robot manipulator. Moreover, rather than relying on model-based trajectory optimisation, the task learning is accomplished using only deep reinforcement learning and sparse rewards.}

Limited onboard computation and real-time planning constraints impose a limit on how large this search tree can grow. Heuristics play a crucial role in such situations by guiding the search towards potentially good directions and consequently minimizing search effort. Moreover, it must infer such directions in an efficient manner using only the information uncovered by the search up until that time. However, state of the art methods do not address the problem of computing a heuristic that \emphexplicitly minimizes search effort. In this paper, we do so by training a heuristic policy that maps the partial information from the search to decide which node of the search tree to expand. Unfortunately, naively training such policies leads to slow convergence and poor local minima. We present \textscSaIL, an efficient algorithm that trains heuristic policies by imitating \emphclairvoyant oracles - oracles that have full information about the world and demonstrate decisions that minimize search effort. We leverage the fact that such oracles can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming and derive performance guarantees for the learnt heuristic. We validate the approach on a spectrum of environments which show that \textscSaIL consistently outperforms state of the art algorithms. Our approach paves the way forward for learning heuristics that demonstrate an anytime nature - finding feasible solutions quickly and incrementally refining it over time.

We present an approach - supplemental to fine tuning on the real robot - to further benefit from parallel access to a simulator during training. The developed approach harnesses auxiliary rewards to guide the exploration for the real world agent based on the proficiency of the agent in simulation and vice versa. In this context, we demonstrate empirically that the reciprocal alignment for both agents provides further benefit as the agent in simulation can adjust to optimize its behaviour for states commonly visited by the real-world agent.}

This paper proposes an approach to learning a closed-loop controller for robotic grasping that dynamically guides the gripper to the object. We use a wrist-mounted sensor to acquire depth images in front of the gripper and train a convolutional neural network to learn a distance function to true grasps for grasp configurations over an image. The training sensor data is generated in simulation, a major advantage over previous work that uses real robot experience, which is costly to obtain. Despite being trained in simulation, our approach works well on real noisy sensor images. We compare our controller in simulated and real robot experiments to a strong baseline for grasp pose detection, and find that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline in the presence of kinematic noise, perceptual errors and disturbances of the object during grasping.}

However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other modalities.  Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally difficult.  In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that combines vision and touch.  To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and from both modalities together. Our experimental results indicate that incorporating tactile readings substantially improve grasping performance.}

However, end-to-end methods tend to either be slow to train, exhibit little or no generalisability, or lack the ability to accomplish long-horizon or multi-stage tasks. In this paper, we show how two simple techniques can lead to end-to-end (image to velocity) execution of a multi-stage task, which is analogous to a simple tidying routine, without having seen a single real image. This involves locating, reaching for, and grasping a cube, then locating a basket and dropping the cube inside. To achieve this, robot trajectories are computed in a simulator, to collect a series of control velocities which accomplish the task. Then, a CNN is trained to map observed images to velocities, using domain randomisation to enable generalisation to real world images. Results show that we are able to successfully accomplish the task in the real world with the ability to generalise to novel environments, including those with dynamic lighting conditions, distractor objects, and moving objects, including the basket itself. We believe our approach to be simple, highly scalable, and capable of learning long-horizon tasks that have until now not been shown with the state-of-the-art in end-to-end robot control.}

One learning signal that is always available for autonomously collected data is prediction. If a robot can learn to predict the future, it can use this predictive model to take actions to produce desired outcomes, such as moving an object to a particular location. However, in complex open-world scenarios, designing a representation for prediction is difficult. In this work, we instead aim to enable self-supervised robot learning through direct video prediction: instead of attempting to design a good representation, we directly predict what the robot will see next, and then use this model to achieve desired goals. A key challenge in video prediction for robotic manipulation is handling complex spatial arrangements such as occlusions. To that end, we introduce a video prediction model that can keep track of objects through occlusion by incorporating temporal skip-connections. Together with a novel planning criterion and action space formulation, we demonstrate that this model substantially outperforms prior work on video prediction-based control. Our results show manipulation of objects not seen during training, handling multiple objects, and pushing objects around obstructions. These results represent a significant advance in the range and complexity of skills that can be performed entirely with self-supervised robot learning. }

In this work, we present a meta-imitation learning method that enables a robot to learn how to learn more efficiently, allowing it to acquire new skills from just a single demonstration. Unlike prior methods for one-shot imitation, our method can scale to raw pixel inputs and requires data from significantly fewer prior tasks for effective learning of new skills. Our experiments on both simulated and real robot platforms demonstrate the ability to learn new tasks, end-to-end, from a single visual demonstration.}

The motion dynamics are approximated using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and its parameters are learned subject to constraints derived from partial contraction analysis. Systems learned using the proposed method generate trajectories that accurately reproduce the demonstrations and are guaranteed to converge to a desired goal location. Additionally, the learned models are capable of quickly and appropriately adapting to unexpected spatial perturbations and changes in goal location during reproductions. The CDSP algorithm is evaluated on shapes from a publicly available human handwriting dataset and also compared with two state-of-the-art motion generation algorithms. Furthermore, the CDSP algorithm is also shown to be capable of learning and reproducing point-to-point motions directly from real-world demonstrations using a Baxter robot.}

In light of the introduction of automated vehicles into transportation systems, there is a new need for understanding the impacts of automation on transportation networks. The present article formulates and approaches the mixed-autonomy traffic control problem (where both automated and human-driven vehicles are present) using the powerful framework of deep reinforcement learning (RL). The resulting policies and emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy traffic settings provide insight for the potential for automation of traffic through mixed fleets of automated and manned vehicles. Model-free learning methods are shown to naturally select policies and behaviors previously designed by model-driven approaches, such as stabilization and platooning, known to improve ring road efficiency and to even exceed a theoretical velocity limit. Remarkably, RL succeeds at maximizing velocity by effectively leveraging the structure of the human driving behavior to form an efficient vehicle spacing for an intersection network. We describe our results in the context of existing control theoretic results for stability analysis and mixed-autonomy analysis. This article additionally introduces state equivalence classes to improve the sample complexity for the learning methods.}

In prior work, we proposed an algorithm called Deep Discovery of Options (DDO) to discover options to accelerate reinforcement learning in Atari games. This paper studies an extension to robot imitation learning, called Discovery of Deep Continuous Options (DDCO), where low-level continuous control skills parametrized by deep neural networks are learned from demonstrations. We extend DDO with: (1) a hybrid categorical-continuous distribution model to parametrize high-level policies that can invoke discrete options as well continuous control actions, and (2) a cross-validation method that relaxes DDOâs requirement that users specify the number of options to be discovered. We evaluate DDCO in simulation of a 3-link robot in the vertical plane pushing a block with friction and gravity, and in two physical experiments on the da Vinci surgical robot, needle insertion where a needle is grasped and inserted into a silicone tissue phantom, and needle bin picking where needles and pins are grasped from a pile and categorized into bins. In the 3-link arm simulation, results suggest that DDCO can take 3x fewer demonstrations to achieve the same reward compared to a baseline imitation learning approach. In the needle insertion task, DDCO was successful 8/10 times compared to the next most accurate imitation learning baseline 6/10. In the surgical bin picking task, the learned policy successfully grasps a single object in 66 out of 99 attempted grasps, and in all but one case successfully recovered from failed grasps by retrying a second time.}

We extend the proposed model to learn long-term occupancy maps in dynamic environments in a sequential fashion, demonstrating the power of kernel methods to capture abstract nonlinear patterns and Bayesian learning to construct sophisticated models. Experiments conducted in environments with moving vehicles show that the proposed approach has a significant speed improvement over the state-of-the-art techniques and maintain a similar or better accuracy. We also discuss the robustness against occlusions and various theoretical and empirical aspects of building long-term dynamic occupancy maps.}

It is shown that not only can an E-GP model be used to estimate the latent state of large-scale physical systems of this type, but that a single E-GP model can generalize over multiple physically-similar systems over a range of parameters using only a few training sets. This is demonstrated on computational flow dynamics (CFD) data sets on fluid flowing past a cylinder at different Reynolds numbers. Though these systems are governed by highly nonlinear partial differential equations (the Navier-Stokes equations), we show that their major dynamical modes can be captured by a linear dynamical layer over the temporal evolution of the weights of stationary kernels. Furthermore, the model generated by this method provides easy access to physical insights into the system, unlike comparable methods like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The low computational cost of this method suggests that it has the potential to enable machine learning approximations of complex physical phenomena for autonomy and robotic design tasks.}

For example, we might want a robot to align and assemble a gear onto an axle or insert and turn a key in a lock. These goal-oriented tasks present a considerable challenge for reinforcement learning, since their natural reward function is sparse and prohibitive amounts of exploration are required to reach the goal and receive some learning signal. Past approaches tackle these problems by exploiting expert demonstrations or by manually designing a task-specific reward shaping function to guide the learning agent. Instead, we propose a method to learn these tasks without requiring any prior knowledge other than obtaining a single state in which the task is achieved.  The robot is trained in âreverse", gradually learning to reach the goal from a set of starting positions increasingly far from the goal. Our method automatically generates a curriculum of starting positions that adapts to the agentâs performance, leading to efficient training on goal-oriented tasks.  We demonstrate our approach on difficult simulated navigation and fine-grained manipulation problems, not solvable by state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.}

We model bin picking with a discrete-time Partially Observable Markov Decision Process that specifies states of the heap, point cloud observations, and rewards. We collect synthetic demonstrations of bin picking from an algorithmic supervisor uses full state information to optimize for the most robust collision-free grasp in a forward simulator based on pybullet to model dynamic object-object interactions and robust wrench space analysis from the Dexterity Network (Dex-Net) to model quasi-static contact between the gripper and object. We learn a policy by fine-tuning a Grasp Quality CNN on Dex-Net 2.1 to classify the supervisorâs actions from a dataset of 10,000 rollouts of the supervisor in the simulator with noise injection. In 2,192 physical trials of bin picking with an ABB YuMi on a dataset of 50 novel objects, we find that the resulting policies can achieve 94$%$ success rate and 96$%$ average precision (very few false positives) on heaps of 5-10 objects and can clear heaps of 10 objects in under three minutes.

Additionally, DSMâs top-ranked response is significantly more likely to be correct than the top-ranked responses of naive analogy estimations.}
