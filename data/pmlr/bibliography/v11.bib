 abstract = {In this article we present an application of text-analysis technologies to support social science research, in particular the analysis of patterns in news content. We describe a system that gathers and annotates large volumes of textual data in order to extract patterns and trends. We have examined 3.5 million news articles and show that their topic is related to the gender bias and readability of their content. This study is intended to illustrate how pattern analysis technology can be deployed to automate tasks commonly performed by humans in the social sciences, in order to enable large scale studies that would otherwise be impossible.},

 abstract = {Zero-days attacks are one of the most dangerous threats against computer networks. These, by denition, are attacks never seen before. Thus, defense tools based on a database of rules (usually referred as \signatures) that describe known attacks cannot do anything against them. Recently, defense tools based on machine learning algorithms have gained an increasing popularity as they oer the possibility to ght o also zero-days attacks. In this paper we propose HMMPayl, an anomaly based Intrusion Detection System for the protection of a web server and of the applications the server hosts. HMMPayl analyzes the network trac toward the web server and it is based on Hidden Markov Models. With this paper we provide for several contributions. First, the algorithm implemented by HMMPayl allows to carefully model the payload increasing the classication accuracy with respect to previously proposed solutions. Second, we show that an approach based on multiple classiers leads to an increased classication accuracy with respect to the case where a single classier is used. Third, exploiting the redundancy within the information extracted from the payload we propose a solution to reduce the computational cost of the algorithm.},

 abstract = {This paper describes Pinview, a content-based image retrieval system that exploits implicit relevance feedback during a search session. Pinview contains several novel methods that infer the intent of the user. From relevance feedback, such as eye movements or clicks, and visual features of images Pinview learns a similarity metric between images which depends on the current interests of the user. It then retrieves images with a specialized reinforcement learning algorithm that balances the tradeo between exploring new images and exploiting the already inferred interests of the user. In practise, we have integrated Pinview to the content-based image retrieval system PicSOM, in order to apply it to realworld image databases. Preliminary experiments show that eye movements provide a rich input modality from which it is possible to learn the interests of the user.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v11-balcazar10a,
 abstract = {We focus on association rule mining. It is well-known that naive miners end up often providing far too large amounts of mined associations to result actually useful in practice. Many proposals exist for selecting appropriate association rules, trying to measure their interest in various ways; most of these approaches are statistical in nature, or share their main traits with statistical notions. Alternatively, some existing notions of redundancy among association rules allow for a logical-style characterization and lead to irredundant bases (axiomatizations) of absolutely minimum size. Here we follow up on a study of closure-based redundancy, which, in practice, leads to smaller bases than simpler alternative forms of redundancy, with the proviso that, in principle, they need to be complemented with an implicational basis. One can push the intuition of redundancy further and gain a perspective of the interest of association rules in terms of their \novelty with respect to other rules. An irredundant rule is so because its condence is higher than what the rest of the rules would suggest; then, one can ask: how much higher? Among several variants, a recently proposed parameter, the condence boost, succeeds in measuring a notion of novelty along these lines so that it ts better the needs of practical applications. However, that notion is based on plain redundancy, of relatively limited practical usefulness. Here we extend the condence boost to closure-based redundancy, paying a small theoretical price to obtain several advantages in practical applications. We describe a rule-mining system implementing this contribution.},

Its first motivation is to establish a common platform and standardization for MHT procedures at large. The $\mu$TOSS software has been designed and written in the framework of a âHarvest Programmeâ call of the PASCAL2 European research network. Basically, it consists of the two R packages mutoss and mutossGUI. For researchers, it features a convenient unification of interfaces for MHT procedures (including standardized functions to access existing specific MHT R packages such as multtest and multcomp, as well as recent MHT procedures that are not available elsewhere) and helper functions facilitating the setup of benchmark simulations for comparison of competing methods. For end users, a graphical user interface and an online user's guide for finding appropriate methods for a given specification of the multiple testing problem is included. Ongoing maintenance and subsequent extensions will aim at establishing $\mu$TOSS as a state of the art in statistical computing for MHT.},

N-to-m mapping objects, such as paraphrases, non-literal translations, and multiword expressions, may appear as both noise and also as valid training data. From this perspective, this paper tries to answer the following two questions: 1) how to detect stable patterns where noise seems legitimate, and 2) how to reduce such noise, where applicable, by supplying extra information as prior knowledge to a word aligner.},

 abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of predicting when the available data is incomplete. We show that changing the generally accepted table-wise view of the sample items into a graph representable one allows us to solve these kind of problems in a very concise way by using the well known convex, one-class classication based, optimisation framework. The use of the one-class formulation in the learning phase and in the prediction as well makes the entire procedure highly consistent. The graph representation can express the complex interdependencies among the data sources. The underlying optimisation problem can be transformed into a on-line algorithm, e.g. a perceptron type one, and in this way it can deal with data sets of million items. This framework covers and encompasses supervised, semi-supervised and some unsupervised learning problems. Furthermore, the data sources can be chosen as not only simple binary variables or vectors but text documents, images or even graphs with complex internal structures.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v11-trampus10a,
 abstract = {This paper describes a set of visualization tools which aid the understanding of discussion topics and trends in online discussion forums. The tools integrate into the forumâs web page, allowing for easy exploration of its contents. Three visualizations are presented: a visual browsing suggestions mechanism, a semantic âatlasâ providing a thematic overview of larger forum segments, and a timeline displaying temporal evolution of forum topics. The underlying algorithms have very few language-dependent components. The software is operational and can be tested live on Slovene, Slovak and Hungarian pilot sites, containing up to 5 million forum posts.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v11-xie10a,
 abstract = {This paper developed a diagnosis model based on Support Vector Machines (SVM) with a novel hybrid feature selection method to diagnose erythemato-squamous diseases. Our hybrid feature selection method, named IFSFFS (ImprovedF -score and Sequential Forward Floating Search), combines the advantages of lters and wrappers to select the optimal feature subset from the original feature set. In our IFSFFS, we rstly generalized the originalF -score to the improvedF -score measuring the discrimination of more than two sets of real numbers. Then we proposed to combine Sequential Forward Floating Search (SFFS) and our improved F -score to accomplish the optimal feature subset selection. Where, our improved F -score is an evaluation criterion for lters, while SFFS and SVM compose an evaluation system of wrappers. The best parameters of kernel function of SVM are found out by grid search technique with ten-fold cross validation. Experiments have been conducted on ve random training-test partitions of the erythemato-squamous diseases dataset from UCI machine learning database. The experimental results show that our SVM-based model with IFSFFS achieved the optimal classication accuracy with no more than 14 features as well.},
