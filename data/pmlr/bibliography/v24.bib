  abstract = 	 {We consider the problem of learning high-performance Exploration/Exploitation (E/E) strategies for finite Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the MDP to be controlled is supposed to be drawn from a known probability distribution $p_\mathcal{M}(\cdot)$. The performance criterion is the sum of discounted rewards collected by the E/E strategy over an infinite length trajectory. We propose an approach for solving this problem that works by considering a rich set of candidate E/E strategies and by looking for the one that gives the best average performances on MDPs drawn according to $p_\mathcal{M}(\cdot)$. As candidate E/E strategies, we consider index-based strategies parametrized by small formulas combining variables that include the estimated reward function, the number of times each transition has occurred and the optimal value functions and the optimal value functions $\hat{V}$ and $\hat{Q}$ of the estimated MDP (obtained through value iteration). The search for the best formula is formalized as a multi-armed bandit problem, each arm being associated with a formula. We experimentally compare the performances of the approach with R-max as well as with $\epsilon$-Greedy strategies and the results are promising.}

Our approach builds upon Sallans and Hinton (2004), who parameterized value functions using energy-based models, trained using a non-linear variant of temporal-difference (TD) learning. Unfortunately, non-linear TD is known to diverge in theory and practice. We introduce the first sound and efficient algorithm for training energy-based policies, based on an actor-critic architecture. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, converges close to a local optimum, and outperforms Sallans and Hinton (2004) in several high dimensional domains.}

  abstract = 	 {Experimental results suggest that transfer learning (TL), compared to learning from scratch, can decrease exploration by reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most existing TL algorithms for RL are heuristic and may result in worse performance than learning from scratch (i.e., negative transfer). We introduce a theoretically grounded and flexible approach that transfers action-values via an intertask mapping and, based on those, explores the target task systematically. We characterize positive transfer as (1) decreasing sample complexity in the target task compared to the sample complexity of the base RL algorithm (without transferred action-values) and (2) guaranteeing that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy (i.e., negligible optimality loss). The sample complexity of our approach is no worse than the base algorithm's, and our analysis reveals that positive transfer can occur even with highly inaccurate and partial intertask mappings. Finally, we empirically test directed exploration with transfer in a multijoint reaching task, which highlights the value of our analysis and the robustness of our approach under imperfect conditions.}

The method is based on the bottleneck principle and identifies skills using a bottom-up hierarchical clustering of the estimated transition graph. In contrast to prior clustering approaches, it can be used incrementally and thus several times during the learning process. Our empirical evaluation shows that âassuming dense local connectivity in the face of uncertaintyâ can prevent premature identification of skills. Furthermore, we show that the choice of the linkage criterion is crucial for dealing with non-random sampling policies and stochastic environments.}

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth comparative study of several off-policy evaluation methods in non-bandit, finite-horizon MDPs, using randomly generated MDPs, as well as a Mallard population dynamics model [Anderson, 1975] . We find that un-normalized importance sampling can exhibit prohibitively large variance in problems involving look-ahead longer than a few time steps, and that dynamic programming methods perform better than Monte-Carlo style methods.}

Unfortunately, existing algorithms for learning TD networks are known to diverge, even in very simple problems. In this paper we present the first sound learning rule for TD networks. Our approach is to develop a true gradient descent algorithm that takes account of all three roles performed by each node in the network: as state, as an answer, and as a target for other questions. Our algorithm combines gradient temporal-difference learning (Maei et al., 2009) with real-time recurrent learning (Williams and Zipser, 1994). We provide a generalisation of the Bellman equation that corresponds to the semantics of the TD network, and prove that our algorithm converges to a fixed point of this equation.}

In particular, we consider the case where the expert acts so as to maximize an unknown reward function defined as a linear combination of a set of state features. In this paper, we consider the setting where we observe many sample trajectories (i.e., sequences of states) but only one or a few of them are labeled as experts' trajectories. We investigate the conditions under which the remaining unlabeled trajectories can help in learning a policy with a good performance. In particular, we define an extension to the max-margin inverse reinforcement learning proposed by Abbeel and Ng [2004] where, at each iteration, the max-margin optimization step is replaced by a semi-supervised optimiza- tion problem which favors classifiers separating clusters of trajectories. Finally, we report empirical results on two grid-world domains showing that the semi-supervised algorithm is able to output a better policy in fewer iterations than the related algorithm that does not take the unlabeled trajectories into account.}

Recently, Ross et al. [2011] proposed the dataset aggre- gation algorithm (DAgger) and compared it with Searn in sequential prediction tasks. In this paper, we compare these two algorithms in the context of a more complex structured prediction task, namely biomedical event extraction. We demonstrate that DAgger has more stable performance and faster learning than Searn, and that these advantages are more pronounced in the parameter-free versions of the algorithms.}
