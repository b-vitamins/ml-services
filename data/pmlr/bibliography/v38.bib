  abstract = 	 {A gamma process dynamic Poisson factor analysis model is proposed to factorize a dynamic count matrix, whose columns are sequentially observed count vectors. The model builds a novel  Markov chain that sends the latent gamma random variables at time (t-1) as the shape parameters of those at time t, which are linked to observed or latent counts under the Poisson likelihood.  The significant challenge of inferring the gamma shape parameters is fully addressed, using unique data augmentation and marginalization techniques for the negative binomial distribution. The same nonparametric Bayesian model also applies to the factorization of a dynamic binary matrix, via a Bernoulli-Poisson link that connects a binary observation to a latent count, with closed-form conditional posteriors for the latent counts and efficient computation for sparse observations. We apply the model to text and music analysis, with state-of-the-art results.}

Here, we introduce novel \emphspectral gap error bounds that judiciously exploit the potentially rapid spectrum decay in the input matrix, a most common occurrence in machine learning and data analysis. Our error bounds are much tighter than existing ones for matrices with rapid spectrum decay, and they justify the use of a constant amount of oversampling relative to the rank parameter k, i.e, when the number of columns/rows is \ell=k+ O(1).  We demonstrate our analysis on a novel deterministic algorithm, \emphStableCUR, which additionally eliminates a previously unrecognized source of potential instability in CUR decompositions.  While our algorithm accepts any method of row and column selection, we implement it with a recent column selection scheme with strong singular value bounds.  Empirical results on various classes of real world data matrices demonstrate that our algorithm is as efficient as and often outperforms competing algorithms.}

However, in many application scenarios, the information obtained by playing an arm provides information about the remainder of the arms. Hence, in such applications, this informativeness can and should be exploited to enable faster convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper, formalize a new class of multi-armed bandit methods, Global Multi-armed Bandit (GMAB), in which arms are globally informative through a global parameter, i.e., choosing an arm reveals information about all the arms. We propose a greedy policy for the GMAB which always selects the arm with the highest estimated expected reward, and prove that it achieves bounded parameter-dependent regret. Hence, this policy selects suboptimal arms only finitely many times, and after a finite number of initial time steps, the optimal arm is selected in all of the remaining time steps with probability one. In addition, we also study how the informativeness of the arms about each otherâs rewards affects the speed of learning. Specifically, we prove that the parameter-free (worst-case) regret is sublinear in time, and decreases with the informativeness of the arms. We also prove a sublinear in time Bayesian risk bound for the GMAB which reduces to the well-known Bayesian risk bound for linearly parameterized bandits when the arms are fully informative. GMABs have applications ranging from drug dosage control to dynamic pricing.}

Specifically, we consider a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with two non-spherical Gaussian components, where the clusters are distinguished by only a few relevant dimensions. The method we propose is a combination of a recent approach for learning parameters of a Gaussian mixture model and sparse linear discriminant analysis (LDA). In addition to cluster assignments, the method returns an estimate of the set of features relevant for clustering. Our results indicate that the sample complexity of clustering depends on the sparsity of the relevant feature set, while only scaling logarithmically with the ambient dimension. Further, we require much milder assumptions than existing work on clustering in high dimensions. In particular, we do not require spherical clusters nor necessitate mean separation along relevant dimensions.}

Logical MRFs are a general class of models that can incorporate many common dependencies, such as logical implications and mixtures of supermodular and submodular potentials. They can be used for many structured prediction tasks, including natural language processing, computer vision, and computational social science. We show that our new inference technique can improve solution quality by as much as 20% without sacrificing speed on problems with over one million dependencies.}

We then present a natural application to learning mixture models in the PAC framework. For learning a mixture of k axis-aligned Gaussians in d dimensions, we give an algorithm that outputs a mixture of O(k/Îµ^3) Gaussians that is Îµ-close in statistical distance to the true distribution, without any separation assumptions. The time and sample complexity is roughly O(kd/Îµ^3)^d. This is polynomial when d is constant â precisely the regime in which known methods fail to identify the components efficiently.  Given that non-negativity is a natural assumption, we believe that our result may find use in other settings in which we wish to approximately âexplainâ data using a small number of a (large) candidate set of components.}

Unfortunately, naive modeling with aggregated data may significantly diminish the accuracy of inferences at the individual level. This paper addresses the scenario where features are provided at the individual level, but the target variables are only available as histogram aggregates or order statistics. We consider a limiting case of generalized linear modeling when the target variables are only known up to permutation, and explore how this relates to permutation testing; a standard technique for assessing statistical dependency. Based on this relationship, we propose a simple algorithm to estimate the model parameters and individual level inferences via alternating imputation and standard generalized linear model fitting. Our results suggest the effectiveness of the proposed approach when, in the original data, permutation testing accurately ascertains the veracity of the linear relationship. The framework is extended to general histogram data with larger bins - with order statistics such as the median as a limiting case. Our experimental results on simulated data and aggregated healthcare data suggest a diminishing returns property with respect to the granularity of the histogram - when a linear relationship holds in the original data, the targets can be predicted accurately given relatively coarse histograms.}

We present the Reverse AIS Estimator (RAISE), a stochastic lower bound on the log-likelihood of an approximation to the original MRF model. RAISE requires only the same MCMC transition operators as standard AIS. Experimental results indicate that RAISE agrees closely with AIS log-probability estimates for RBMs, DBMs, and DBNs, but typically errs on the side of underestimating, rather than overestimating, the log-likelihood.}

For Gaussian measurements, our estimator is comparable to the best known in the literature, along with guarantees on support recovery. For sub-Gaussian measurements, our estimator has an irreducible error which, unlike existing results, can be controlled by scaling the measurement vectors.

Gradient boosting, which is used to automatically induce and select feature functions, is a natural candidate solution to the problem.  However, it is non-trivial to derive gradient boosting algorithms for CRFs due to the dense Hessian matrices introduced by variable dependencies. Existing approaches thus use only first-order information when optimizing likelihood, and hence face convergence issues. We incorporate second-order information by deriving a Markov Chain mixing rate bound to quantify the dependencies, and introduce a gradient boosting algorithm that iteratively optimizes an adaptive upper bound of the objective function.  The resulting algorithm induces and selects features for CRFs via functional space optimization, with provable convergence guarantees.  Experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate that the mixing rate based upper bound is effective for learning CRFs with non-linear potentials.}

In this paper, we propose a filtered search (FS) framework that allows the user to set an arbitrary approximation bound guarantee with a âtunable knobâ, from 0 (arbitrarily bad) to 1 (globally optimal). FS naturally handles monotone and non-monotone functions as well as unconstrained problems and problems with cardinality, matroid, and knapsack constraints. Further, it can also be applied to (non-negative) non-submodular functions and still gives controllable approximation bounds based on their submodularity ratio. Finally,  FS encompasses the greedy algorithm as a special case. Our framework is based on theory in A* search, but is substantially more efficient because it only requires heuristics that are critically admissible (CA) rather than admissibleâa condition that gives more effective pruning and is substantially easier to implement.}

  abstract = 	 {Predictive inverse optimal control is a powerful approach for estimating the control policy of an agent from observed control demonstrations. Its usefulness has been established in a number of large-scale sequential decision settings characterized by complete state observability. However, many real decisions are made in situations where the state is not fully known to the agent making decisions. Though extensions of predictive inverse optimal control to partially observable Markov decision processes have been developed, their applicability has been limited by the complexities of inference in those representations. In this work, we extend predictive inverse optimal control to the linear- quadratic-Gaussian control setting. We establish close connections between optimal control laws for this setting and the probabilistic predictions under our approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit in estimating control policies that are influenced by partial observability on both synthetic and real datasets.}

Previous algorithm by Parviainen and Koivisto (2011) evaluates all possible ancestor relations in time O(n3^n) and space O(3^n). However, their algorithm assumes an order-modular prior over DAGs that does not respect Markov equivalence. The resulting posteriors would bias towards DAGs consistent with more linear orders. To adhere to the uniform prior, we develop a new DP algorithm that computes the exact posteriors of all possible ancestor relations in time O(n^25^n-1) and space O(3^n).

These assumptions enable us to explain the complexity of the fully decoupled neural network through the prism of the results from random matrix theory. We show that for large-size decoupled networks the lowest critical values of the random loss function form a layered structure and they are located in a well-defined band lower-bounded by the global minimum. The number of local minima outside that band diminishes exponentially with the size of the network. We empirically verify that the mathematical model exhibits similar behavior as the computer simulations, despite the presence of high dependencies in real networks. We conjecture that both simulated annealing and SGD converge to the band of low critical points, and that all critical points found there are local minima of high quality measured by the test error. This emphasizes a major difference between large- and small-size networks where for the latter poor quality local minima have non-zero probability of being recovered. Finally, we prove that recovering the global minimum becomes harder as the network size increases and that it is in practice irrelevant as global minimum often leads to overfitting.}

This is a very challenging problem since typically only incomplete traces are observed and we need to unroll the incomplete traces into the past in order to pinpoint the source. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing a two-stage framework, which first learns a continuous-time diffusion network based on historical diffusion traces and then identifies the source of an incomplete diffusion trace by maximizing the likelihood of the trace under the learned model. Experiments on both large synthetic and real-world data show that our framework can effectively go back to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation time  significantly more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.}

For these processes, conjugacy is proved via statistical machinery tailored to the particular model.

This article addresses the fundamental question about the computational complexity of determining whether there is a hypotheses class with a hypothesis such that the upper bound on the generalization error is below a certain value. Results of this type are important for model comparison and selection. This paper takes a first step and proves that minimizing a basic margin-bound is NP-hard when considering linear hypotheses and the rho-margin loss function, which generalizes  the ramp loss.

This paper formulates this problem as a learning game between three parties: 1) data contributors using a filter to sanitize data samples, 2) a cooperative data aggregator learning a target task using the filtered samples, and 3) an adversary learning to identify contributors using the same filtered samples. Minimax filters that achieve the optimal privacy-utility trade-off from broad families of filters and loss/classifiers are defined, and algorithms for learning the filers in batch or distributed settings are presented. Experiments with several real-world tasks including facial expression recognition, speech emotion recognition, and activity recognition from motion, show that the minimax filter can simultaneously achieve similar or better target task accuracy and lower privacy risk, often significantly lower than previous methods.}

Although several algorithms were proposed in the last decade, the consistency of the localization results was not discussed in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides theoretical guarantees for the localization results. Our new approach is to formulate the task as solving the sparsest subgraph problem on a difference graph. Since this problem is NP-hard, we then use a convex quadratic programming approximation algorithm, which is guaranteed to be consistent under suitable conditions. Across the simulations on both synthetic and real world datasets, we verify that the proposed method achieves higher anomaly localization performance compared to existing methods.}

The proposed method assumes that latent vectors in different domains are generated from a common Gaussian distribution with a full covariance matrix. By inferring the mean and covariance of the common Gaussian from given cross-domain rating matrices, the latent factors are aligned, which enables us to predict ratings in different domains. Experiments conducted on rating datasets from a wide variety of domains, e.g., movie, books and electronics, demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher performance for predicting cross-domain ratings than existing methods.}

We show that computing the partition function for SPPs (and Log-SPPs), requires exponential complexity in the worst case, and also provide algorithms which approximate SPPs up to polynomial factors. Moreover, for several subclasses of interesting submodular functions that occur in applications, we show how we can provide efficient closed form expressions for the partition functions, and  thereby marginals and conditional distributions. We also show how SPPs are closed under mixtures, thus enabling maximum likelihood   based strategies for learning mixtures of submodular functions. Finally, we argue how SPPs complement existing Log-SPP distributions, and are a natural model for several applications.}

We present a fully adaptive method that competes with dynamic benchmarks in which regret guarantee scales with regularity of the sequence of cost functions and comparators. Notably, the regret bound adapts to the smaller complexity measure in the problem environment.

Furthermore, also in a completely unsupervised manner, can one construct a more accurate unsupervised ensemble classifier? In this paper, focusing on the binary case, we present simple, computationally efficient algorithms to solve these questions.   Furthermore, under standard classifier independence assumptions, we prove our methods are consistent and study their asymptotic error. Our approach is spectral, based on the fact that the off-diagonal entries of the classifiersâ covariance matrix and 3-d tensor are rank-one.

We prove that in the absence of structural assumptions, the sample complexity of this problem is proportional to the sum of the inverse gaps squared of the Borda scores of each arm. We explore this dependence further and consider structural constraints on the pairwise comparison matrix (a particular form of sparsity natural to this problem) that can significantly reduce the sample complexity. This motivates a new algorithm called Successive Elimination with Comparison Sparsity (SECS) that exploits sparsity to find the Borda winner using fewer samples than standard algorithms. We also evaluate the new algorithm experimentally with synthetic and real data. The results show that the sparsity model and the new algorithm can provide significant improvements over standard approaches.}

For this reason bottom-up conditional models have traditionally dominated in such domains. We find that widely-used, general-purpose message passing inference algorithms such as Expectation Propagation (EP) and Variational Message Passing (VMP) fail on the simplest of vision models. With these models in mind, we introduce a modification to message passing that learns to exploit their layered structure by passing âconsensusâ messages that guide inference towards good solutions. Experiments on a variety of problems show that the proposed technique leads to significantly more accurate inference results, not only when compared to standard EP and VMP, but also when compared to competitive bottom-up conditional models.}

Although most robust classification problems assume that every uncertain data lie within an identical bounded set, this paper considers a generalized model where the sizes of the bounded sets are different for each data. These models can be transformed into regularized classification models where the penalties for each data are assigned according to their losses. We see that considering such models opens up for new applications. For an example, we show that this robust classification technique can be used for Imbalanced Data Learning. We conducted experimentation with actual data and compared it with other IDL algorithms such as Cost Sensitive SVMs. This is a novel usage for the robust classification scheme and encourages it to be a suitable candidate for imbalanced data learning.}

While this problem is NP hard (as we show), we develop several practical algorithms to find approximate and near-optimal solutions for this problem, some of which provide lower and others of which provide upper bounds thereby allowing us to compute a tightness gap. We also show that some of our algorithms can be extended to handle more general forms of supermodularity restricted to arbitrary pairwise terms.

We show that the commonly used tool to address this issue, that of shrinkage, alleviates the problem only to a certain extent and the fundamental issue of over-specialization still remains.   In this work, we explore a different approach to address the problem, that of employing dropouts, a tool that has been recently proposed in the context of learning deep neural networks. We propose a novel way of employing dropouts to tackle the issue of over-specialization in MART, resulting in the DART algorithm. We evaluate DART on ranking, regression and classification tasks, using large scale, publicly available datasets, and show that DART outperforms MART in each of the tasks, with a significant margin.}

Our method is conceptually simple and also applies to non-orthogonal and asymmetric tensors of arbitrary order. We prove that a small number random projections essentially preserves the spectral information in the tensor, allowing us to remove the dependence on the eigengap that plagued earlier tensor-to-matrix reductions.

In this paper, we propose to replace the random sampling step in a particle filter by Frank-Wolfe optimization. By optimizing the position of the particles, we can obtain better accuracy than random or quasi-Monte Carlo sampling. In applications where the evaluation of the emission probabilities is expensive (such as in robot localization), the additional computational cost to generate the particles through optimization can be justified. Experiments on standard synthetic examples as well as on a robot localization task indicate indeed an improvement of accuracy over random and quasi-Monte Carlo sampling.}

In application domains, such as bioinformatics, where there is also demand for probabilistic predictions with measures of uncertainty, the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) model, introduced by Chipman et al. (2010), is increasingly popular. As data sets have grown in size, however, the standard MetropolisâHastings algorithms used to per- form inference in BART are proving inadequate. In particular, these Markov chains make local changes to the trees and suffer from slow mixing when the data are high- dimensional or the best-fitting trees are more than a few layers deep. We present a novel sampler for BART based on the Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm (Andrieu et al., 2010) and a top-down particle filtering algorithm for Bayesian decision trees (Lakshminarayanan et al., 2013). Rather than making local changes to individual trees, the PG sampler proposes a complete tree to fit the residual.

This approach overcomes the limitation of existing models on expressing vertex affinity and on reflecting properties of different subgraphs.

In this paper we relax BHC into a non-probabilistic formulation, exploring smallvariance asymptotics in conjugate-exponential models. We develop a novel clustering algorithm, referred to as relaxed BHC (RBHC), from the asymptotic limit of the BHC model that exhibits the scalability of distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms as well as the flexibility of Bayesian nonparametric models. We also investigate the reducibility of the dissimilarity measure emerged from the asymptotic limit of the BHC model, allowing us to use scalable algorithms such as the nearest neighbor chain algorithm.

We present a framework for performing gradient-based policy optimization in the RKHS, deriving the functional gradient of the return for our policy, which has a simple form and can be estimated efficiently. The policy representation naturally focuses on the relevant region of state space defined by the policy trajectories, and does not rely on a-priori defined basis points; this can be an advantage in high dimensions where suitable basis points may be difficult to define a-priori. The method is adaptive in the sense that the policy representation will naturally adapt to the complexity of the policy being modelled, which is achieved with standard efficient sparsification tools in an RKHS. We argue that finding a good kernel on states can be easier then remetrizing a high dimensional feature space. We demonstrate the approach on benchmark domains and a simulated quadrocopter navigation task.}

To overcome these limitations, we introduce a conceptual separation between learning, used to infer attacker preferences, and operational decisions, which account for adversarial evasion, enforce operational constraints, and naturally admit randomization. Our approach gives rise to an intractably large linear program. To overcome scalability limitations, we introduce a novel method for estimating a compact parity basis representation for the operational decision function. Additionally, we develop an iterative constraint generation approach which embeds adversaryâs best response calculation, to arrive at a scalable algorithm for computing near-optimal randomized operational decisions.

  abstract = 	 {A good measure of similarity between data points is crucial to many tasks in machine learning. Similarity and metric learning methods learn such measures automatically from data, but they do not scale well respect to  the dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we propose a method that can learn efficiently similarity measure from high-dimensional sparse data. The core idea is to parameterize the similarity measure as a convex combination of rank-one matrices with specific sparsity structures. The parameters are then optimized with an approximate Frank-Wolfe procedure to maximally satisfy relative similarity constraints on the training data. Our algorithm greedily incorporates one pair of features at a time into the similarity measure, providing an efficient way to control the number of active features and thus reduce overfitting. It enjoys very appealing convergence guarantees and its time and memory complexity depends on the sparsity of the data instead of the dimension of the feature space. Our experiments on real-world high-dimensional datasets demonstrate its potential for classification, dimensionality reduction and data exploration.}

Using k-means clustering as a prototypical unsupervised learning problem, we show how we can strategically summarize the data (control space) in order to trade off risk and time when data is generated by a probabilistic model. Our summarization is based on coreset constructions from computational geometry. We also develop an algorithm, TRAM, to navigate the space/time/data/risk tradeoff in practice. In particular, we show that for a fixed risk (or data size), as the data size  increases (resp. risk increases) the running time of TRAM decreases. Our extensive experiments on real data sets demonstrate the existence and practical utility of such tradeoffs, not only for k-means but also for Gaussian Mixture Models.}

Given a description of the desired patterns (in the form of a classifier taking functional inputs), we sequentially decide where to query function values to identify as many regions matching the pattern as possible, with high confience.  For one broad class of models the expected reward of each unobserved point can be computed analytically.  We demonstrate the proposed algorithm on three difficult search problems: locating polluted regions in a lake via mobile sensors, forecasting winning electoral districts with minimal polling, and identifying vortices in a fluid flow simulation.}

Learning the parameters of structured predictors is a central task in machine learning applications. However, training the model from data often becomes computationally expensive. Several methods have been proposed to exploit the model structure, or decomposition, in order to obtain efficient training algorithms. In particular, methods based on linear programming relaxation, or dual decomposition, decompose the prediction task into multiple simpler prediction tasks and enforce agreement between overlapping predictions. In this work we observe that relaxing these agreement constraints and replacing them with soft constraints yields a much easier optimization problem. Based on this insight we propose an alternative training objective, analyze its theoretical properties, and derive an algorithm for its optimization. Our method, based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, achieves significant speedups over existing state-of-the-art methods without hurting prediction accuracy.}

Like sequential Monte Carlo sampling, the proposed method uses a sequence of Markov transitions to adapt the sampling to favour more influential regions of the integrand (modes). However, AMCS differs in the type of transitions that may be used, the number of Markov chains, and the method of chain termination. In particular, from each point sampled from an initial proposal, AMCS collects a sequence of points by simulating two independent, but antithetic, Markov chains, each terminated by a sample-dependent stopping rule. This approach provides greater flexibility for targeting influential areas while eliminating the need to fix the length of the Markov chain a priori. We show that the resulting estimator is unbiased and can reduce variance on peaked multi-modal integrands that challenge existing methods.}

Function to function regression (FFR) covers a large range of interesting applications including time-series prediction problems, and also more general tasks like studying a mapping between two separate types of distributions. However, previous nonparametric estimators for FFR type problems scale badly computationally with the number of input/output pairs in a data-set. Given the complexity of a mapping between general functions it may be necessary to consider large data-sets in order to achieve a low estimation risk. To address this issue, we develop a novel scalable nonparametric estimator, the Triple-Basis Estimator (3BE), which is capable of operating over datasets with many instances. To the best of our knowledge, the 3BE is the first nonparametric FFR estimator that can scale to massive data-sets. We analyze the 3BEâs risk and derive an upperbound rate. Furthermore, we show an improvement of several orders of magnitude in terms of prediction speed and a reduction in error over previous estimators in various real-world data-sets.}

The player seeks to maximize the expected return from the adaptive bandit, and the associated optimization problem is related to the free energy of a statistical mechanical system under an external field. When the underlying stochastic distribution is Gaussian, we derive an analytic solution for the long run optimal player strategy for different regimes of the bandit. In the fully adversarial limit, this solution is equivalent to the Nash equilibrium of a two-player, zero-sum semi-infinite game. We show how optimal strategies can be learned from sequential draws and reward observations in these adaptive bandits using Bayesian filtering and Thompson sampling.  Results show the qualitative difference in policy pseudo-regret between our proposed strategy and other well-known bandit algorithms.}

The current literature is split into two kinds of tests - those which are consistent without any assumptions about how the distributions may differ (\textitgeneral alternatives), and those which are designed to specifically test easier alternatives, like a difference in means (\textitmean-shift alternatives). The main contribution of this paper is to explicitly characterize the power  of a popular nonparametric two sample test, designed for general alternatives, under a mean-shift alternative in the  high-dimensional setting. Specifically, we explicitly derive the power of the linear-time Maximum Mean Discrepancy statistic using the Gaussian kernel, where the dimension and sample size can both tend to infinity at any rate, and the two distributions differ in their means. As a corollary, we find that if the signal-to-noise ratio is held constant, then the testâs power goes to one if the number of samples increases faster than the dimension increases. This is the first explicit power derivation for a general nonparametric test in the high-dimensional setting, and  the first analysis of how tests designed for general alternatives perform against easier ones.}

Current inference schemes for models involving the gamma process are restricted to MCMC-based methods, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we present a variational inference framework for models involving gamma process priors. Our approach is based on a novel stick-breaking constructive definition of the gamma process. We prove correctness of this stick-breaking process by using the characterization of the gamma process as a completely random measure (CRM), and we explicitly derive the rate measure of our construction using Poisson process machinery. We also derive error bounds on the truncation of the infinite process required for variational inference, similar to the truncation analyses for other nonparametric models based on the Dirichlet and beta processes. Our representation is then used to derive a variational inference algorithm for a particular Bayesian nonparametric latent structure formulation known as the infinite  Gamma-Poisson model, where the latent variables are drawn from a gamma process prior with Poisson likelihoods. Finally, we present results for our algorithm on non-negative matrix factorization tasks on document corpora, and show that we compare favorably to both sampling-based techniques and variational approaches based on beta-Bernoulli priors, as well as a direct DP-based construction of the gamma process.}

Our proposed estimator allows analytic and computationally efficient approximation of multi-dimensional high-order density derivatives, with the ability that all hyper-parameters can be chosen objectively by cross-validation. We further show that the proposed density-derivative estimator is useful in improving the accuracy of non-parametric KL-divergence estimation via metric learning. The practical superiority of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated in change detection and feature selection.}

Consequently, estimating P(Y|X) from P(X) should not be possible. However, estimating P(X|Y) based on P(Y) may be possible.   This paper employs this asymmetry to propose CURE, a causal discovery method which decides upon the causal direction by comparing the accuracy of the estimations of P(Y|X) and P(X|Y).

This adds much-needed flexibility to the "textbook" MH algorithm where all measures involved must be given in terms of densities with respect to a common reference measure.

We show how a large class of temporal TP regression models can be reformulated as state space models, and how a forward filtering and backward smoothing recursion can be derived for solving the inference analytically in linear time complexity. This is a novel finding that generalizes the previously known connection between Gaussian process regression and Kalman filtering to more general elliptical processes and non-Gaussian Bayesian filtering. We derive this connection, demonstrate the benefits of the approach with examples, and finally apply the method to empirical data.}

We study how to use stochastic gradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two concrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local differential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy requirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.  The main contribution of this paper is to identify how heterogeneous noise impacts performance. We show that given two datasets with heterogeneous noise, the order in which to use them in standard SGD depends on the learning rate. We propose a method for changing the learning rate as a function of the heterogeneity, and prove new regret bounds for our method in two cases of interest. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on real data.}

We overcome these difficulties by developing algorithms based on fixed-point theory; our methods respect the psd constraint, while also efficiently solving the (possibly) nonconcave maximization to global optimality. Subsequently, we focus on mixture modeling using EG distributions: we present a closed-form expression of the KL-divergence between two EG distributions, which we then combine with our ML estimation methods to obtain an efficient split-and-merge expectation maximization algorithm.

To combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly efficient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP) has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data.

Although there exist a large number of similarity measures between distributions, very little is known about their generalization performance in specific learning tasks. Learning problems formulated on distributions have an inherent two-stage sampled difficulty: in practice only samples from sampled distributions are observable, and one has to build an estimate on similarities computed between sets of points. To the best of our knowledge, the only existing method with consistency guarantees for distribution regression requires kernel density estimation as an intermediate step (which suffers from slow convergence issues in high dimensions), and the domain of the distributions to be compact Euclidean. In this paper, we provide theoretical guarantees for a remarkably simple algorithmic alternative to solve the distribution regression problem: embed the distributions to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and learn a ridge regressor from the embeddings to the outputs. Our main contribution is to prove the consistency of this technique in the two-stage sampled setting under mild conditions (on separable, topological domains endowed with kernels). As a special case, we answer a 15-year-old open question: we establish the consistency of the classical set kernel [Haussler, 1999; Gaertner et. al, 2002] in regression, and cover more recent kernels on distributions, including those due to [Christmann and Steinwart, 2010].}

Yet the preference orders by real humans become irrationally reversed, when the choice set of available options is manipulated. In order to accurately predict choice decisions involving preference reversals, which existing econometric methods have failed to incorporate, the authors introduce a new cognitive choice model whose parameters are efficiently fitted with a global convex optimization algorithm. The proposed model captures each human as a Bayesian decision maker facing a mental conflict between objective evaluation samples and a subjective prior, where the underlying objective evaluation function is rationally independent from contexts while the subjective prior is irrationally determined by each choice set. As the key idea to analytically handle the irrationality and to yield the convex optimization, the Bayesian decision mechanism is implemented as a closed-form Gaussian process regression using similarities among the available options in each context. By explaining the irrational decisions as a consequence of averting uncertainty, the proposed model outperformed the existing econometric models in predicting the irrational choice decisions recorded in real-world datasets.}

We address the question of whether MAR is testable, given that data are corrupted by missingness, by proposing a general method for identifying testable implications imposed by the graphical structure on the observed data.}

Important examples of M, for which the proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, include the sphere, the set of positive definite matrices, and the Grassmannian. The proposed algorithm constructs a data-affinity matrix by thoroughly exploiting the intrinsic geometry and then applies spectral clustering. Local geometry is encoded by sparse coding and directional information of local tangent spaces and geodesics, which is important in resolving intersecting clusters and establishing the theoretical guarantees for a simplified variant of the algorithm. To avoid complication, these guarantees assume that the underlying submanifolds are geodesic.  Extensive validation on synthetic and real data demonstrates the resiliency of the proposed method against deviations from the theoretical (geodesic) model as well as its superior performance over state-of-the-art techniques.}

However, it is well-established that in the high-dimensional setting (p > N) the underlying projection estimator degenerates. Moreover, any linear discriminate function involving a large number of features may be difficult to interpret. To ameliorate these issues, two general categories of sparse LDA modifications have been proposed, both to reduce the number of active features and to stabilize the resulting projections. The first, based on optimal scoring, is more straightforward to implement and analyze but has been heavily criticized for its ambiguous connection with the original LDA formulation. In contrast, a second strategy applies sparse penalty functions directly to the original LDA objective but requires additional heuristic trade-off parameters, has unknown global and local minima properties, and requires a greedy sequential optimization procedure. In all cases the choice of sparse regularizer can be important, but no rigorous guidelines have been provided regarding which penalty might be preferable. Against this backdrop, we winnow down the broad space of candidate sparse LDA algorithms and promote a specific selection based on optimal scoring coupled with a particular, complementary sparse regularizer. This overall process ultimately progresses our understanding of sparse LDA in general, while leading to targeted modifications of existing algorithms that produce superior results in practice on three high-dimensional gene data sets.}

We propose a new MM procedure that yields fast MM algorithms for a wide variety of manifold embedding problems. In our majorization step, two parts of the cost function are respectively upper bounded by quadratic and Lipschitz surrogates, and the resulting upper bound can be minimized in closed form. For cost functions amenable to such QL-majorization, the MM yields monotonic improvement and is efficient: in experiments the newly developed MM algorithms outperform five state-of-the-art optimization approaches in manifold embedding tasks.}

Despite the success of existing tensor factorization approaches, they are either unable to capture nonlinear interactions, or computationally expensive to handle massive data. In addition, most of the existing methods lack a principled way to discover latent clusters, which is important for better understanding of the data. To address these issues, we propose a scalable nonparametric tensor decomposition model. It employs Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) prior to model the latent clusters; it uses local Gaussian processes (GPs) to capture nonlinear relationships and to improve scalability. An efficient online variational Bayes Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed to learn the model. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed model is able to discover latent clusters with higher prediction accuracy than competitive methods. Furthermore, the proposed model obtains significantly better predictive performance than the state-of-the-art large scale tensor decomposition algorithm, GigaTensor, on two large datasets with billions of entries.}

Despite strong performance for a number of clustering tasks, spectral graph cut algorithms still suffer from several limitations: first, they require the number of clusters to be known in advance, but this information is often unknown a priori; second, they tend to produce clusters with uniform sizes. In some cases, the true clusters exhibit a known size distribution; in image segmentation, for instance, human- segmented images tend to yield segment sizes that follow a power-law distribution. In this paper, we propose a general framework of power-law graph cut algorithms that produce clusters whose sizes are power-law distributed, and also does not fix the number of clusters upfront. To achieve our goals, we treat the Pitman-Yor exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) as a regularizer to graph cut objectives. Because the result- ing objectives cannot be solved by relaxing via eigenvectors, we derive a simple iterative algorithm to locally optimize the objectives. Moreover, we show that our proposed algorithm can be viewed as performing MAP inference on a particular Pitman-Yor mixture model. Our experiments on various data sets show the effectiveness of our algorithms.}

  abstract = 	 {Sparse Gaussian graphical models characterize sparse dependence relationships between random variables in a network. To estimate multiple related Gaussian graphical models on the same set of variables, we formulate a hierarchical model, which leads to an optimization problem with a nonconvex log-shift penalty function. We show that under mild conditions the optimization problem is convex despite the inclusion of a nonconvex penalty, and derive an efficient optimization algorithm. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that the proposed method is able to achieve good selection and estimation performance simultaneously, because the nonconvexity of the log-shift penalty allows for weak signals to be thresholded to zero without excessive shrinkage on the strong signals.}
