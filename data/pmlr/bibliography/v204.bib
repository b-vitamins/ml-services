  abstract = 	 {UCI WorldTour races, the premier menâs elite road cycling tour, are grueling events that put physical fitness and endurance of riders to the test. The coaches of Team Jumbo-Visma have long been responsible for predicting the energy needs of each rider of the Dutch team for every race on the calendar. Those must be estimated to ensure riders have the energy and resources necessary to maintain a high level of performance throughout a race. This task, however, is both time-consuming and challenging, as it requires precise estimates of race speed and power output. Traditionally, the approach to predicting energy needs has relied on judgement and experience of coaches, but this method has its limitations and often leads to inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a new, more effective approach to predicting energy needs for cycling races. By predicting the speed and power with regression models, we provide the coaches with calorie needs estimates for each individual rider per stage instantly. In addition, we compare methods to quantify uncertainty using conformal prediction. The empirical analysis of the jackknife+, jackknife-minmax, jackknife-minmax-after-bootstrap, CV+, CV-minmax, conformalized quantile regression, and inductive conformal prediction methods in conformal prediction reveals that all methods achieve valid prediction intervals. All but minmax-based methods also produce sufficiently narrow prediction intervals for decision-making. Furthermore, methods computing prediction intervals of fixed size produce tighter intervals for low significance values.  Among the methods computing intervals of varying length across the input space, inductive conformal prediction computes narrower prediction intervals at larger significance level.}

While developing ASR models adapted to such context, a range of techniques are being explored to measure the uncertainty of their predictions.  In this paper, we present two algorithms: the first one applies the Conformal Risk Control paradigm to predict a set of sentences that controls the Word Error Rate (WER) to an adjustable level of guarantee. The second algorithm uses Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) to predict uncertain words in an automatic transcription. We analyze the performance of the three algorithms using an open-source ASR model based on Wav2vec 2.0. The CP algorithms were trained on the âclean testâ part of the LibriSpeech corpus that contains approximately 2,600 sentences. The results show that the three algorithms provide valid and efficient prediction sets. We guarantee that the WER is below 2% with a confidence level of 80% and an average set size of 29 sentences and we detect 90% of the badly transcripted words.}

  abstract = 	 {Disk scrubbing is a process aimed at resolving read errors on disks by reading data from the disk. However, scrubbing the entire storage array at once can adversely impact system performance, particularly during periods of high input/output operations. Additionally, the continuous reading of data from disks when scrubbing can result in wear and tear, especially on larger capacity disks, due to the significant time and energy consumption involved. To address these issues, we propose a selective disk scrubbing method that enhances the overall reliability and power efficiency in data centers. Our method employs a Machine Learning model based on Mondrian Conformal prediction to identify specific disks for scrubbing, by proactively predicting the health status of each disk in the storage pool, forecasting n-days in advance, and using an open-source dataset. For disks predicted as non-healthy, we mark them for replacement without further action. For healthy drives, we create a set and quantify their relative health across the entire storage pool based on the predictorâs confidence. This enables us to prioritize selective scrubbing for drives with established scrubbing frequency based on the scrub cycle. The method we propose provides an efficient and dependable solution for managing enterprise disk drives. By scrubbing just 22.7% of the total storage disks, we can achieve optimized energy consumption and reduce the carbon footprint of the data center. }

  abstract = 	 {Neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is considered the gold standard preoperative treatment for reducing tumor charge in breast cancer. However, the tumorâs pathological response highly depends on patient conditions and clinical factors. There is a dire need to develop modeling tools to predict a patient response to NAT and thus improve personalized medical care plans. Recent studies have shown promising results of machine learning (ML) methodologies in breast cancer prognosis through the combination of several modalities, including imaging and molecular features derived from biopsy analyses. We here present a ML model to predict response to NAT through two sequential prediction stages. First, a pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging model is trained, followed by a second model with molecular biomarkers-enriched data. We propose the integration of the Conformal Prediction (CP) framework in the first non-invasive model to identify patients whose predicted responses show large uncertainty and refer them to the second model that includes data from invasive tests. The major advantage of this procedure is in the reduction of unnecessary biopsies. Different alternatives for the standard ML algorithms and the CP functions are explored on a publicly available clinical dataset. Results clearly show the potential of our uncertainty-aware clinical predictive tool in such real scenarios.}

A short-term forecast is available from a few hours before the forecasted time period and is only extended a couple days into the future.  The methods are supplied ensemble forecasts as input and additionally the Conformal methods are supplied with post-processed point forecasts for generating the probability distributions. In the NECP case we propose a method of producing probability distributions by creating sequentially larger prediction intervals. The methods are compared through a teaching schedule, to mimic a real-world setting. For each model update in the teaching schedule a grid-search approach is applied to select each methodâs optimal hyperparameters, respectively. The methods are tested out of the box with tweaks to few hyperparameters. We also introduce a normalized nonconformity score and use it with the conformal method that handles data that violates the exchangeability assumption. The resulting probability distributions are compared to actual wind measurements through Continuous Ranked Probability Scores (CRPS) as well as their validity and efficiency of certain prediction intervals.  Our results suggest that the conformal based methods, with the pre-trained underlying model, produce slightly more conservative but more efficient probability distributions than QRF at a lower computational cost. We further propose how the conformal-based methods could be improved for the application to real-world scenarios. }

We start by using unsupervised learning with the cosine metric to provide clear indications if it is possible to classify the data into the different security events occurring at the time of capture. We then build a model, designed to be robust in terms of the orientation of the device, to evaluate the risk of sensitive data being correctly identified from magnetometer data despite the limited sampling rate. Using a model trained with LSTM on the whole data set with an 80/20 split, our results show 100% accuracy on our reverse Turing test and 67.5% on the key press test.  We also show that when analysing the captured magnetometer responses to playing sound samples from the loudspeaker it is very difficult to infer the original sound. We extend the work using Inductive Conformal Prediction by examining the property of uncertainty for different confidence levels. We also show that despite a high degree of uncertainty there is the potential to infer security properties such as the layout of a screen. To this end we show that the number 5 in the center of a keypad occurs a disproportionately high number of times in the prediction set (68.3%).}

  abstract = 	 {The widespread use of machine learning models has achieved considerable success across various domains. Nevertheless, their deployment in safety-critical systems can result in catastrophic consequences if uncertainties are not handled properly. This study is concerned with the simulation of the physical response of a subsea pipeline when it is hooked by an anchor. Predicting this response is crucial for risk assessment, however, it is computationally unfeasible to run a significant amount of input sets to compute the probability of failure of the system. Therefore, the use of a surrogate model becomes essential. In this context, a surrogate model is a machine learning model trained on data from a physicsbased simulation. This is achieved by neural network based surrogate models, as they are capable of modelling complex relationships and provide greater accuracy than other machine learning models in many use cases. However, to ensure the safe use of these models, it is important to understand the uncertainty associated with their predictions. Therefore, we apply the conformal prediction framework to provide valid prediction intervals and improve the uncertainty quantification of the neural network models. In order to create adaptive conformal prediction intervals, we employ multilayer perceptron neural network models that provide uncertainty estimates through both the Monte Carlo dropout technique and treating the output as a Gaussian distribution, with the neural network providing estimates for both mean and variance. The conformal prediction procedure improves the uncertainty estimation of uncalibrated models and guarantees new test samples are within the predicted intervals with the corresponding selected confidence level.}

This set is difficult to compute for complex systems even if the system dynamics are known and given by a system of ordinary differential equations with known coefficients. In practice, parameters are often unknown and mathematical models difficult to obtain. Data-based approaches are promised to avoid these difficulties by estimating the reach set based on a sample of states. If a model is available, this training set can be obtained through numerical simulation. In the absence of a model, real-life observations can be used instead. A recently proposed approach for data-based reach set approximation uses Christoffel functions to approximate the reach set. Under certain assumptions, the approximation is guaranteed to converge to the true solution. In this paper, we improve upon these results by notably improving the sample efficiency and relaxing some of the assumptions by exploiting statistical guarantees from conformal prediction with training and calibration sets. In addition, we exploit an incremental way to compute the Christoffel function to avoid the calibration set while maintaining the statistical convergence guarantees.

  abstract = 	 {In semi-supervised learning, the paradigm of self-training refers to the idea of learning from pseudo-labels suggested by the learner itself. Recently, corresponding methods have proven effective and achieve state-of-the-art performance, e.g., when applied to image classification problems. However, pseudo-labels typically stem from ad-hoc heuristics, relying on the quality of the predictions though without guaranteeing their validity. One such method, so-called credal self-supervised learning, maintains pseudo-supervision in the form of sets of (instead of single) probability distributions over labels, thereby allowing for a flexible yet uncertainty-aware labeling. Again, however, there is no justification beyond empirical effectiveness. To address this deficiency, we make use of conformal prediction, an approach that comes with guarantees on the validity of set-valued predictions. As a result, the construction of credal sets of labels is supported by a rigorous theoretical foundation, leading to better calibrated and less error-prone supervision for unlabeled data. Along with this, we present effective algorithms for learning from credal self-supervision. An empirical study demonstrates excellent calibration properties of the pseudo-supervision, as well as the competitiveness of our method on several image classification benchmark datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {In supervised learning problems, it is common to have a lot of unlabeled data, but little labeled data. It is then desirable to leverage the unlabeled data to improve the learning procedure. One way to do this is to have a model predict âpseudolabelsâ for the unlabeled data, so as to use them for learning. In self-learning, the pseudo-labels are provided by the very same model to which they are fed. As these pseudo-labels are by nature uncertain and only partially reliable, it is then natural to model this uncertainty and take it into account in the learning process, if only to robustify the self-learning procedure. This paper describes such an approach, where we use Venn-Abers Predictors to produce calibrated credal labels so as to quantify the pseudo-labeling uncertainty. These labels are then included in the learning process by optimizing an adapted loss. Experiments show that taking into account pseudo-label uncertainty both robustifies the self-learning procedure and allows it to converge faster in general.}

Although the effectiveness of the framework has been thoroughly demonstrated, current investigations have provided limited insights only regarding what parts of the transferred PI contribute to the improved performance. A better understanding of this could not only lead to computational savings but potentially also to novel strategies for exploiting PI.

We present results from experiments with five classification and three regression datasets, in which we compare the Shapley values of the PI computed in two different settings; one where the PI is assumed to be available during both training and testing, hence representing an ideal scenario, and a second setting, in which the PI is available during training only but is transferred to test objects, through KT-LUPI.

  abstract = 	 {Multi-label classification is a common challenge in various machine learning applications, where a single data instance can be associated with multiple classes simultaneously. The current paper proposes a novel tree-based method for multi-label classification using conformal prediction and multiple hypothesis testing. The proposed method employs hierarchical clustering with labelsets to develop a hierarchical tree, which is then formulated as a multiple-testing problem with a hierarchical structure. The split-conformal prediction method is used to obtain marginal conformal p-values for each tested hypothesis, and two hierarchical testing procedures are developed based on marginal conformal p-values, including a hierarchical Bonferroni procedure and its modification for controlling the family-wise error rate. The prediction sets are thus formed based on the testing outcomes of these two procedures. We establish a theoretical guarantee of valid coverage for the prediction sets through proven family-wise error rate control of those two procedures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a simulation study and two real data analysis compared to other conformal methods for multi-label classification.}

  abstract = 	 {In many situations, probabilistic predictors have replaced conformal classifiers. The main reason is arguably that the set predictions of conformal classifiers, with the accompanying significance level, are hard to interpret. In this paper, we demonstrate how conformal classification can be used as a basis for a classifier with reject option. Specifically, we introduce and evaluate two algorithms that are able to perfectly estimate accuracy or precision for a set of test instances, in a classifier with reject scenario. In the empirical investigation, the suggested algorithms are shown to clearly outperform both calibrated and uncalibrated probabilistic predictors.}

We show that by plotting the performance of each predictor for different significance levels in $\epsilon$ $\in$ [0, 1], we receive a coverage vs acceptanceerror curve for that predictor. The area under this curve represents the probability that the p-value of randomly chosen true class-label of any test instance is greater than the p-value of any other false class-label for the same or any other test instance. This area can be used as a metric for predictive efficiency of a conformal predictor, when the validity has been established. The new metric is unique in that it is related to the empirical coverage rate, and extensive experiments confirmed its utility and difference from existing predictive efficiency criteria.}

  abstract = 	 {Conformal Prediction (CP) offers a shift on the traditional supervised classification paradigm. Whereas in supervised learning one generally aims to optimize the error of a classifier at predicting the label correctly (prediction error), in CP one aims to optimize the size of a prediction set (efficiency), where this set is guaranteed to contain the true label with probability $\geq 1-\varepsilon$, for a user-defined $\varepsilon \in[0,1]$. CP works as a wrapper around a traditional learning model; yet, it is unclear how the prediction error of the underlying model affects the efficiency of the CP. In this note, we study a simple class of CPs whose efficiency is proportional to the prediction error of the underlying model.}

CP methods can be abstracted into building blocks that can be deployed on any type of data, model, or task. In this work, we contribute to the wide diffusion of the CP framework by developing the library MAPIE1 that implements such principles and can address seamlessly different tasks (e.g. classification, regression, time-series) and in different settings (split and cross-conformal). All these concepts are under a common umbrella with an emphasis on readability, transparency, and reliability, hence supporting the principles of trustworthy AI. An original feature of MAPIE is to offer the possibility of designing tailored-made non-conformity scores in particular p-normalized residual non-conformal scores that can be defined to account for asymmetric errors. We show theoretically the marginal coverage guarantee in several settings. We highlight through applications the interest of choosing different non-conformity scores for tabular data when considering local coverage.}
