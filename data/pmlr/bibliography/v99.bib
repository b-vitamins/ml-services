 abstract = {Multiple users getting one sample each from an unknown  distribution seek to enable a central server to conduct statistical inference. However, each player can only provide limited amount of information about its sample to the server.  We propose a unified framework to study such distributed inference problems under local information constraints.  We model the local information constraints by a set of channels $\mathcal{W}$: each player chooses a channel from $\mathcal{W}$, and then passes their data through this channel before transmitting the output to the server. The goal in this distributed setting is to understand the blow-up in data requirement imposed by the information constraints, compared to the centralized setting where all data samples are available to the server.  We introduce two notions of \emph{chi-square fluctuations} which provide bounds for the  average distance and the distance to the  average of a local perturbation. When information constraints are imposed, by the standard data-processing inequality, pairwise distances contract and so do our chi-square fluctuations. We provide a precise characterization of this contraction for discrete $k$-ary distributions and use it to obtain to general lower bounds for distribution learning and testing under information constraints. Our results involve  notions of minmax and maxmin chi-square fluctuations, where  the maximum is over the choice of channels and the minimum is over perturbations. The former emerges when considering public-coin protocols for testing and is bounded in terms of Frobenius norm of a positive semidefinite matrix $H$, a function of the channel family $\mathcal{W}$. The latter appears for private-coin protocols and is bounded by the nuclear norm of $H$ which is smaller than its Frobenius norm, establishing a separation between the sample complexity of testing using public and private coins.},

 abstract = {We consider online learning in an adversarial, non-convex setting under the assumption that the learner has an access to an offline optimization oracle. In the general setting of prediction with expert advice, Hazan et al. (2016) established that in the optimization-oracle model, online learning requires exponentially more computation than statistical learning. In this paper we show that by slightly strengthening the oracle model, the online and the statistical learning models become computationally equivalent. Our result holds for any Lipschitz and bounded (but not necessarily convex) function. As an application we demonstrate how the offline oracle enables efficient computation of an equilibrium in non-convex games, that include GAN (generative adversarial networks) as a special case.},

 abstract = {It is common to encounter situations where one must solve a sequence of similar computational problems. Running a standard algorithm with worst-case runtime guarantees on each instance will fail to take advantage of valuable structure shared across the problem instances. For example, when a commuter drives from work to home, there are typically only a handful of routes that will ever be the shortest path. A naive algorithm that does not exploit this common structure may spend most of its time checking roads that will never be in the shortest path. More generally, we can often ignore large swaths of the search space that will likely never contain an optimal solution. 
We present an algorithm that learns to maximally prune the search space on repeated computations, thereby reducing runtime while provably outputting the correct solution each period with high probability. Our algorithm employs a simple explore-exploit technique resembling those used in online algorithms, though our setting is quite different. We prove that, with respect to our model of pruning search spaces, our approach is optimal up to constant factors. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our model and algorithm to three classic problems: shortest-path routing, string search, and linear programming. We present experiments confirming that our simple algorithm is effective at significantly reducing the runtime of solving repeated computations.},

 abstract = {In this work, we consider the sample complexity required for testing the monotonicity of distributions over partial orders. A distribution $p$ over a poset is monotone if, for any pair of domain elements $x$ and $y$ such that $x \preceq y$, $p(x) \leq p(y)$. To understand the sample complexity of this problem, we introduce a new property called bigness over a finite domain, where the distribution is $T$-big if the minimum probability for any domain element is at least $T$. We establish a lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log n)$ for testing bigness of distributions on domains of size $n$. We then build on these lower bounds to give $\Omega(n/\log{n})$ lower bounds for testing monotonicity over a matching poset of size $n$ and significantly improved lower bounds over the hypercube poset. We give sublinear sample complexity bounds for testing bigness and for testing monotonicity over the matching poset. 
We then give a number of tools for analyzing upper bounds on the sample complexity of 
the monotonicity testing problem.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v99-aliakbarpour19b,
 abstract = { There has been significant study on the sample complexity of testing properties of distributions over large domains.  For many properties, it is known that the sample complexity can be substantially smaller than the domain size. For example, over a domain of size $n$, distinguishing the uniform distribution from distributions that are far from uniform in $\ell_1$-distance uses only $O(\sqrt{n})$ samples.  However, the picture is very different in the presence of arbitrary noise, even when the amount of noise is quite small.  In this case, one must distinguish if samples are coming from a distribution that is $\epsilon$-close to uniform from the case where the distribution is $(1-\epsilon)$-far from uniform.  The latter task requires nearly linear in $n$ samples (Valiant, 2008; Valiant and Valiant, 2017a). In this work, we present a noise model that on one hand is more tractable for the testing problem, and on the other hand represents a rich class of noise families.   In our model, the noisy distribution is a mixture of the original distribution and noise, where the latter is known to the tester either explicitly or via sample access; the form of the noise is also known \emph{a priori}.  Focusing on the identity and closeness testing problems leads to the following mixture testing question:  Given samples of distributions $p, q_1,q_2$, can we test if $p$ is a mixture of $q_1$ and $q_2$?  We consider this general question in various scenarios that differ in terms of how the tester can access the distributions, and show that indeed this problem is more tractable.  Our results  show that the sample complexity of our testers are exactly the same as for the classical non-mixture case. },

A crucial intermediate step is proving a non-asymptotic martingale central limit theorem (CLT), i.e., establishing the rates of convergence of a multivariate martingale difference sequence to a normal random vector, which might be of independent interest. We obtain the explicit rates for the multivariate martingale CLT using a combination of Stein's method and Lindeberg's argument, which is then used in conjunction with a non-asymptotic analysis of averaged SGD proposed in [PJ92]. Our results have potentially interesting consequences for computing confidence intervals for parameter estimation with SGD and constructing hypothesis tests with SGD that are valid in a non-asymptotic sense.},

 abstract = {We consider variational inequalities coming from monotone operators, a setting that includes convex minimization and convex-concave saddle-point problems. We assume an access to potentially noisy unbiased values of the monotone operators and assess convergence through a compatible gap function which corresponds to the standard optimality criteria in the aforementioned subcases. We present a universal algorithm for these inequalities based on the Mirror-Prox algorithm. Concretely, our algorithm simultaneously achieves the optimal rates for the smooth/non-smooth, and noisy/noiseless settings. This is done without any prior knowledge of these properties, and in the general set-up of arbitrary norms and compatible Bregman divergences. For convex minimization and convex-concave saddle-point problems, this leads to new adaptive algorithms. Our method relies on a novel yet simple adaptive choice of the step-size, which can be seen as the appropriate extension of AdaGrad to handle constrained problems.},

 abstract = {Consider the following fundamental learning problem: given input examples $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and their vector-valued labels, as defined by an underlying generative neural network, recover the weight matrices of this network. We consider two-layer networks, mapping $\mathbb{R}^d$ to $\mathbb{R}^m$, with $k$ non-linear activation units $f(\cdot)$, where $f(x) = \max \{x , 0\}$ is the ReLU. Such a network is specified by two weight matrices, $\mathbf{U}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times k}, \mathbf{V}^* \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times d}$, such that the label of an example $x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$ is given by $\mathbf{U}^* f(\mathbf{V}^* x)$, where $f(\cdot)$ is applied coordinate-wise. Given $n$ samples as a matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$ and the (possibly noisy) labels $\mathbf{U}^* f(\mathbf{V}^* \mathbf{X}) + \mathbf{E}$ of the network on these samples, where $\mathbf{E}$ is a noise matrix, our goal is to recover the weight matrices $\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\mathbf{V}^*$. 
In this work, we develop algorithms and hardness results under varying assumptions on the input and noise. Although the problem is NP-hard even for $k=2$, by assuming Gaussian marginals over the input $\mathbf{X}$ we are able to develop polynomial time algorithms for the approximate recovery of $\mathbf{U}^*$ and $\mathbf{V}^*$. Perhaps surprisingly, in the noiseless case our algorithms recover $\mathbf{U}^*,\mathbf{V}^*$ exactly, i.e., with no error. To the best of the our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to accomplish exact recovery. For the noisy case, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that approximately recovers the weights in the presence of mean-zero noise $\mathbf{E}$. Our algorithms generalize to a larger class of rectified activation functions, $f(x) = 0$ when $x\leq 0$, and $f(x) > 0$ otherwise.},

 abstract = {We present a private learner for halfspaces over an arbitrary finite domain $X\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with sample complexity $mathrm{poly}(d,2^{\log^*|X|})$. The building block for this learner is a differentially private algorithm for locating an approximate center point of $m>\mathrm{poly}(d,2^{\log^*|X|})$ points -- a high dimensional generalization of the median function. Our construction establishes a relationship between these two problems that is reminiscent of the relation between the median and learning one-dimensional thresholds [Bun et al. FOCS '15]. This relationship suggests that the problem of privately locating a center point may have further applications in the design of differentially private algorithms. 
We also provide a lower bound on the sample complexity for privately finding a point in the convex hull. For approximate differential privacy, we show a lower bound of $m=\Omega(d+\log^*|X|)$, whereas for pure differential privacy $m=\Omega(d\log|X|)$.},

 abstract = { We study the identity testing problem in the context of spin systems or undirected graphical models, where it takes the following form: given the parameter specification of the model $M$ and a sampling oracle for the  distribution $\mu_{M^*}$ of an unknown model $M^*$, can we efficiently determine if the two models $M$ and $M^*$ are the same? We consider identity testing for both soft-constraint and hard-constraint systems. In particular, we prove hardness results in two prototypical cases, the \emph{Ising model} and \emph{proper colorings}, and explore whether identity testing is easier than structure learning. For the ferromagnetic (attractive) Ising model, Daskalasis et al. (2018) presented a polynomial time algorithm for identity testing. We prove hardness results in the antiferromagnetic (repulsive) setting in the same regime of parameters where structure learning is known to require a super-polynomial number of samples. Specifically, for $n$-vertex graphs of maximum degree $d$, we prove that if $|\beta| d = \omega(\log{n})$ (where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature parameter), then there is no identity testing algorithm  for the antiferromagnetic Ising model  that runs in polynomial time unless $RP\!=\!NP$. We also establish computational lower bounds for a broader set of parameters under the (randomized) exponential time hypothesis. In our proofs, we  use random graphs as gadgets; this is inspired by similar constructions in seminal works on the hardness of approximateÂ counting. In the hard-constraint setting, we present hardness results  for identity testing for proper colorings.   Our results are based on the presumed hardness of \textsc{#BIS}, the problem of (approximately) counting independent sets in bipartite graphs. In particular, we prove that identity testing for colorings is hard in the same range of parameters  where structure learning is known to be hard, which in turn matches the parameter regime for  NP-hardness of the corresponding decision problem. },

 abstract = {In the dictionary learning (or sparse coding) problem, we are given a collection of signals (vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$), and the goal is to find a basis in which the signals have a sparse (approximate) representation. The problem has received a lot of attention in signal processing, learning, and theoretical computer science. The problem is formalized as factorizing a matrix $X (d \times n)$ (whose columns are the signals) as $X = AY$, where $A$ has a prescribed number $m$ of columns (typically $m \ll n$), and $Y$ has columns that are $k$-sparse (typically $k \ll d$). Most of the known theoretical results involve assuming that the columns of the unknown $A$ have certain incoherence properties, and that the coefficient matrix $Y$ has random (or partly random) structure. 
The goal of our work is to understand what can be said in the absence of such assumptions. Can we still find $A$ and $Y$ such that $X \approx AY$? We show that this is possible, if we allow violating the bounds on $m$ and $k$ by appropriate factors that depend on $k$ and the desired approximation. Our results rely on an algorithm for what we call the threshold correlation problem, which turns out to be related to hypercontractive norms of matrices. We also show that our algorithmic ideas apply to a setting in which some of the columns of $X$ are outliers, thus giving similar guarantees even in this challenging setting.},

 abstract = {Consider the following problem: given two arbitrary densities $q_1,q_2$ and a sample-access to an unknown target density $p$, find which of the $q_i$'s is closer to $p$ in total variation. 
A remarkable result due to Yatracos shows that this problem is tractable in the following sense: there exists an algorithm that uses $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples from $p$ and outputs~$q_i$ such that with high probability, $TV(q_i,p) \leq 3\cdot\mathsf{opt} + \epsilon$, where $\mathsf{opt}= \min\{TV(q_1,p),TV(q_2,p)\}$. Moreover, this result extends to any finite class of densities $\mathcal{Q}$: there exists an algorithm that outputs the best density in $\mathcal{Q}$ up to a multiplicative approximation factor of 3. 
We complement and extend this result by showing that: (i) the factor 3 can not be improved if one restricts the algorithm to output a density from $\mathcal{Q}$, and (ii) if one allows the algorithm to output arbitrary densities (e.g. a mixture of densities from $\mathcal{Q}$), then the approximation factor can be reduced to 2, which is optimal. In particular this demonstrates an advantage of improper learning over proper in this setup. 
We develop two approaches to achieve the optimal approximation factor of 2: an adaptive one and a static one. Both approaches are based on a geometric point of view of the problem and rely on estimating surrogate metrics to the total variation. Our sample complexity bounds exploit techniques from {\it Adaptive Data Analysis}.},

 abstract = {We consider the sorted top-$k$ problem whose goal is to recover the top-$k$ items with the correct order out of $n$ items using pairwise comparisons. In many applications, multiple rounds of interaction can be costly. We restrict our attention to algorithms with a constant number of rounds $r$ and try to minimize the sample complexity, i.e. the number of comparisons. 
When the comparisons are noiseless, we characterize how the optimal sample complexity depends on the number of rounds (up to a polylogarithmic factor for general $r$ and up to a constant factor for $r=1$ or 2). In particular, the sample complexity is $\Theta(n^2)$ for $r=1$, $\Theta(n\sqrt{k} + n^{4/3})$ for $r=2$ and $\tilde{\Theta}\left(n^{2/r} k^{(r-1)/r} + n\right)$ for $r \geq 3$. 
We extend our results of sorted top-$k$ to the noisy case where each comparison is correct with probability $2/3$. When $r=1$ or 2, we show that the sample complexity gets an extra $\Theta(\log(k))$ factor when we transition from the noiseless case to the noisy case. 
We also prove new results for top-$k$ and sorting in the noisy case. We believe our techniques can be generally useful for understanding the trade-off between round complexities and sample complexities of rank aggregation problems.},

 abstract = {We study a strategic version of the multi-armed bandit problem, where each arm is an individual strategic agent and we, the principal, pull one arm each round. When pulled, the arm receives some private reward $v_a$ and can choose an amount $x_a$ to pass on to the principal (keeping $v_a-x_a$ for itself). All non-pulled arms get reward $0$. Each strategic arm tries to maximize its own utility over the course of $T$ rounds. Our goal is to design an algorithm for the principal incentivizing these arms to pass on as much of their private rewards as possible. 
When private rewards are stochastically drawn each round ($v_a^t \leftarrow D_a$), we show that: 
- Algorithms that perform well in the classic adversarial multi-armed bandit setting necessarily perform poorly: For all algorithms that guarantee low regret in an adversarial setting, there exist distributions $D_1,\ldots,D_k$ and an approximate Nash equilibrium for the arms where the principal receives reward $o(T)$. 
- Still, there exists an algorithm for the principal that induces a game among the arms where each arm has a dominant strategy. When each arm plays its dominant strategy, the principal sees expected reward $\mu'T - o(T)$, where $\mu'$ is the second-largest of the means $\mathbb{E}[D_{a}]$. This algorithm maintains its guarantee if the arms are non-strategic ($x_a = v_a$), and also if there is a mix of strategic and non-strategic arms.},

 abstract = {In the general submatrix detection problem, the task is to detect the presence of a small $k \times k$ submatrix with entries sampled from a distribution $\mathcal{P}$ in an $n \times n$ matrix of samples from $\mathcal{Q}$. This formulation includes a number of well-studied problems, such as biclustering when $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Gaussians and the planted dense subgraph formulation of community detection when the submatrix is a principal minor and $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ are Bernoulli random variables. These problems all seem to exhibit a universal phenomenon: there is a statistical-computational gap depending on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ between the minimum $k$ at which this task can be solved and the minimum $k$ at which it can be solved in polynomial time. Our main result is to tightly characterize this computational barrier as a tradeoff between $k$ and the KL divergences between $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ through average-case reductions from the planted clique conjecture. These computational lower bounds hold given mild assumptions on $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ arising naturally from classical binary hypothesis testing. Our results recover and generalize the planted clique lower bounds for Gaussian biclustering in Ma-Wu (2015) and Brennan et al. (2018) and for the sparse and general regimes of planted dense subgraph in Hajek et al. (2015) and Brennan et al. (2018). This yields the first universality principle for computational lower bounds obtained through average-case reductions.},

 abstract = {In the past decade, sparse principal component analysis has emerged as an archetypal problem for illustrating statistical-computational tradeoffs. This trend has largely been driven by a line of research aiming to characterize the average-case complexity of sparse PCA through reductions from the planted clique (PC) conjecture - which conjectures that there is no polynomial-time algorithm to detect a planted clique of size $K = o(N^{1/2})$ in $\mathcal{G}(N, \frac{1}{2})$. All previous reductions to sparse PCA either fail to show tight computational lower bounds matching existing algorithms or show lower bounds for formulations of sparse PCA other than its canonical generative model, the spiked covariance model. Also, these lower bounds all quickly degrade with the exponent in the PC conjecture. Specifically, when only given the PC conjecture up to $K = o(N^α)$ where $α&lt; 1/2$, there is no sparsity level $k$ at which these lower bounds remain tight. If $α\le 1/3$ these reductions fail to even show the existence of a statistical-computational tradeoff at any sparsity $k$. We give a reduction from PC that yields the first full characterization of the computational barrier in the spiked covariance model, providing tight lower bounds at all sparsities $k$. We also show the surprising result that weaker forms of the PC conjecture up to clique size $K = o(N^α)$ for any given $α\in (0, 1/2]$ imply tight computational lower bounds for sparse PCA at sparsities $k = o(n^{α/3})$. This shows that even a mild improvement in the signal strength needed by the best known polynomial-time sparse PCA algorithms would imply that the hardness threshold for PC is subpolynomial. This is the first instance of a suboptimal hardness assumption implying optimal lower bounds for another problem in unsupervised learning.},

 abstract = {We study adaptive regret bounds in terms of the variation of the losses (the so-called path-length bounds) for both multi-armed bandit and more generally linear bandit. We first show that the seemingly suboptimal path-length bound of (Wei and Luo, 2018) is in fact not improvable for adaptive adversary. Despite this negative result, we then develop two new algorithms, one that strictly improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) with a smaller path-length measure, and the other which improves over (Wei and Luo, 2018) for oblivious adversary when the path-length is large. Our algorithms are based on the well-studied optimistic mirror descent framework, but importantly with several novel techniques, including new optimistic predictions, a slight bias towards recently selected arms, and the use of a hybrid regularizer similar to that of (Bubeck et al., 2018). Furthermore, we extend our results to linear bandit by showing a reduction to obtaining dynamic regret for a full-information problem, followed by a further reduction to convex body chasing. We propose a simple greedy chasing algorithm for squared 2-norm, leading to new dynamic regret results and as a consequence the first path-length regret for general linear bandit as well.},

 abstract = {The Mallows model, introduced in the seminal paper of Mallows 1957, is one of the most fundamental ranking distribution over the symmetric group $S_m$. To analyze more complex ranking data, several studies considered the Generalized Mallows model defined by Fligner and Verducci 1986. Despite the significant research interest of ranking distributions, the exact sample complexity of estimating the parameters of a Mallows and a Generalized Mallows Model is not well-understood. The main result of the paper is a tight sample complexity bound for learning Mallows and Generalized Mallows Model. We approach the learning problem by analyzing a more general model which interpolates between the single parameter Mallows Model and the $m$ parameter Mallows model. We call our model Mallows Block Model -- referring to the Block Models that are a popular model in theoretical statistics. Our sample complexity analysis gives tight bound for learning the Mallows Block Model for any number of blocks. We provide essentially matching lower bounds for our sample complexity results. As a corollary of our analysis, it turns out that, if the central ranking is known, one single sample from the Mallows Block Model is sufficient to estimate the spread parameters with error that goes to zero as the size of the permutations goes to infinity. In addition, we calculate the exact rate of the parameter estimation error.},

 abstract = {Gaussian processes (GP) are a well studied Bayesian approach for the optimization of black-box functions. Despite their effectiveness in simple problems, GP-based algorithms hardly scale to high-dimensional functions, as their per-iteration time and space cost is at least quadratic in the number of dimensions $d$ and iterations $t$. Given a set of $A$ alternatives to choose from, the overall runtime $O(t^3A)$ is prohibitive. In this paper we introduce BKB (budgeted kernelized bandit), a new approximate GP algorithm for optimization under bandit feedback that achieves near-optimal regret (and hence near-optimal convergence rate) with near-constant per-iteration complexity and remarkably no assumption on the input space or covariance of the GP. We combine a kernelized linear bandit algorithm (GP-UCB) with randomized matrix sketching based on leverage score sampling, and we prove that randomly sampling inducing points based on their posterior variance gives an accurate low-rank approximation of the GP, preserving variance estimates and confidence intervals. As a consequence, BKB does not suffer from variance starvation, an important problem faced by many previous sparse GP approximations. Moreover, we show that our procedure selects at most $\tilde{O}(d_{eff})$ points, where $d_{eff}$ is the effective dimension of the explored space, which is typically much smaller than both $d$ and $t$. This greatly reduces the dimensionality of the problem, thus leading to a $O(TAd_{eff}^2)$ runtime and $O(A d_{eff})$ space complexity.},

1) Algorithmic robustness: Chaos is robust to agents using any of a general sub-family of Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithms, the well known regret-minimizing dynamics, even when agents mix-and-match dynamics, use different or slowly decreasing step-sizes. 
2) Game theoretic robustness: Chaos is robust to all affine variants of zero-sum games (strictly competitive games), network variants with arbitrary large number of agents and even to competitive settings beyond these. 
Our result is in stark contrast with the time-average convergence of online learning to (approximate) Nash equilibrium, a result widely reported as (weak) convergence to equilibrium.},

 abstract = {We show that on every $n$-point HST metric, there is a randomized online algorithm for metrical task systems (MTS) that is $1$-competitive for service costs and $O(\log n)$-competitive for movement costs. In general, these refined guarantees are optimal up to the implicit constant. While an $O(\log n)$-competitive algorithm for MTS on HST metrics was developed by Bubeck et al. (SODA 2019), that approach could only establish an $O((\log n)^2)$-competitive ratio when the service costs are required to be $O(1)$-competitive. Our algorithm can be viewed as an instantiation of online mirror descent with the regularizer derived from a multiscale conditional entropy. 
In fact, our algorithm satisfies a set of even more refined guarantees; we are able to exploit this property to combine it with known random embedding theorems and obtain, for any $n$-point metric space, a randomized algorithm that is $1$-competitive for service costs and $O((\log n)^2)$-competitive for movement costs.},

 abstract = {Statistical learning theory has largely focused on learning and generalization given independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. Motivated by applications involving time-series data, there has been a growing literature on learning and generalization in settings where data is sampled from an ergodic process. This work has also developed complexity measures, which appropriately extend the notion of Rademacher complexity to bound the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in this setting. Rather than time-series data, our work is  motivated  by settings where data  is sampled on a network or a spatial domain, and thus do not fit well within the framework of prior work. We provide learning and generalization bounds for data that are complexly dependent, yet their distribution satisfies the standard Dobrushinâs condition. Indeed, we show that the standard complexity measures of Gaussian and Rademacher complexities and VC dimension are sufficient measures of complexity for the purposes of bounding the generalization error and learning rates of hypothesis classes in our setting. Moreover, our generalization bounds only degrade by constant factors compared to their i.i.d.Â analogs, and our learnability bounds degrade by log factors in the size of the training set.},

This problem has remained a challenge since the early works of [Tobin 1958, Amemiya 1973, Hausman and Wise 1977], its applications are abundant, and its history dates back even further to the work of Galton, Pearson, Lee, and Fisher. While consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the error rates are not well-understood, especially in high dimensions. Under a thickness assumption about the covariance matrix of the covariates in the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the coefficient vector $w$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $l_2$ error $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k/n})$. Our estimator uses Projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (PSGD) without replacement on the negative log-likelihood of the truncated sample. For the statistically efficient estimation we only need oracle access to the set $S$.In order to achieve computational efficiency we need to assume that $S$ is a union of a finite number of intervals but still can be complicated. PSGD without replacement must be restricted to an appropriately defined convex cone to guarantee that the negative log-likelihood is strongly convex, which in turn is established using concentration of matrices on variables with sub-exponential tails. We perform experiments on simulated data to illustrate the accuracy of our estimator. As a corollary, we show that SGD learns the parameters of single-layer neural networks with noisy activation functions.},

We call a function $f$ a linear $k$-junta if it is completely determined by some $k$-dimensional subspace of the input space. In this paper, we study the problem of testing whether a given $n$ variable function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \{0,1\}$, is a linear $k$-junta or $\epsilon$-far from all linear $k$-juntas, where the closeness is measured with respect to the Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Linear $k$-juntas are a common generalization of two fundamental classes from Boolean function analysis (both of which have been studied in property testing) $\textbf{1.}$ $k$- juntas which are functions on the Boolean cube which depend on at most k of the variables and $\textbf{2.}$ intersection of $k$ halfspaces, a fundamental geometric concept class. 
We show that the class of linear $k$-juntas is not testable, but adding a surface area constraint makes it testable: we give a $\mathsf{poly}(k \cdot s/\epsilon)$-query non-adaptive tester for linear $k$-juntas with surface area at most $s$. We show that the polynomial dependence on $s$ is necessary. Moreover, we show that if the function is a linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$, we give a $(s \cdot k)^{O(k)}$-query non-adaptive algorithm to learn the function up to a rotation of the basis. In particular, this implies that we can test the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with query complexity independent of $n$.},

 abstract = {We continue the study of statistical/computational tradeoffs in learning robust classifiers, following the recent work of Bubeck, Lee, Price and Razenshteyn who showed examples of classification tasks where (a) an efficient robust classifier exists, in the small-perturbation regime; (b) a non-robust classifier can be learned efficiently; but (c) it is computationally hard to learn a robust classifier, assuming the hardness of factoring large numbers. The question of whether a robust classifier for their task exists in the large perturbation regime seems related to important open questions in computational number theory. In this work, we extend their work in three directions. 
First, we demonstrate classification tasks where computationally efficient robust classification is impossible, even when computationally unbounded robust classifiers exist. For this, we rely on the existence of average-case hard functions. 
Second, we show hard-to-robustly-learn classification tasks in the large-perturbation regime. Namely, we show that even though an efficient classifier that is robust to large perturbations exists, it is computationally hard to learn any non-trivial robust classifier. Our first construction relies on the existence of one-way functions, and the second on the hardness of the learning parity with noise problem. In the latter setting, not only does a non-robust classifier exist, but also an efficient algorithm that generates fresh new labeled samples given access to polynomially many training examples (termed as generation by Kearns et. al. (1994)). 
Third, we show that any such counterexample implies the existence of cryptographic primitives such as one-way functions. This leads us to a win-win scenario: either we can learn an efficient robust classifier, or we can construct new instances of cryptographic primitives.},

 abstract = {Given a fixed $n\times d$ matrix $\mathbf{X}$, where $n\gg d$, we study the complexity of sampling from a distribution over all subsets of rows where the probability of a subset is proportional to the squared volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the rows (a.k.a. a determinantal point process). In this task, it is important to minimize the preprocessing cost of the procedure (performed once) as well as the sampling cost (performed repeatedly). To that end, we propose a new determinantal point process algorithm which has the following two properties, both of which are novel: (1) a preprocessing step which runs in time $O(\text{number-of-non-zeros}(\mathbf{X})\cdot\log n)+\text{poly}(d)$, and (2) a sampling step which runs in $\text{poly}(d)$ time, independent of the number of rows $n$. We achieve this by introducing a new regularized determinantal point process (R-DPP), which serves as an intermediate distribution in the sampling procedure by reducing the number of rows from $n$ to $\text{poly}(d)$. Crucially, this intermediate distribution does not distort the probabilities of the target sample. Our key novelty in defining the R-DPP is the use of a Poisson random variable for controlling the probabilities of different subset sizes, leading to new determinantal formulas such as the normalization constant for this distribution. Our algorithm has applications in many diverse areas where determinantal point processes have been used, such as machine learning, stochastic optimization, data summarization and low-rank matrix reconstruction.},

 abstract = {In experimental design, we are given a large collection of vectors, each with a hidden response value that we assume derives from an underlying linear model, and we wish to pick a small subset of the vectors such that querying the corresponding responses will lead to a good estimator of the model. A classical approach in statistics is to assume the responses are linear, plus zero-mean i.i.d. Gaussian noise, in which case the goal is to provide an unbiased estimator with smallest mean squared error (A-optimal design). A related approach, more common in computer science, is to assume the responses are arbitrary but fixed, in which case the goal is to estimate the least squares solution using few responses, as quickly as possible, for worst-case inputs. Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive. We address this by proposing a framework for experimental design where the responses are produced by an arbitrary unknown distribution. We show that there is an efficient randomized experimental design procedure that achieves strong variance bounds for an unbiased estimator using few responses in this general model. Nearly tight bounds for the classical A-optimality criterion, as well as improved bounds for worst-case responses, emerge as special cases of this result. In the process, we develop a new algorithm for a joint sampling distribution called volume sampling, and we propose a new i.i.d. importance sampling method: inverse score sampling. A key novelty of our analysis is in developing new expected error bounds for worst-case regression by controlling the tail behavior of i.i.d. sampling via the jointness of volume sampling. Our result motivates a new minimax-optimality criterion for experimental design which can be viewed as an extension of both A-optimal design and sampling for worst-case regression.},

 abstract = {We investigate the problem of identity testing for multidimensional histogram distributions. A distribution $p: D \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, where $D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, is called a $k$-histogram if there exists a partition of the domain into $k$ axis-aligned rectangles such that $p$ is constant within each such rectangle. Histograms are one of the most fundamental nonparametric families of distributions and have been extensively studied in computer science and statistics. We give the first identity tester for this problem with {\em sub-learning} sample complexity in any fixed dimension and a nearly-matching sample complexity lower bound. 
In more detail, let $q$ be an unknown $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram distribution in fixed dimension $d$, and $p$ be an explicitly given $d$-dimensional $k$-histogram. We want to correctly distinguish, with probability at least $2/3$, between the case that $p = q$ versus $\|p-q\|_1 \geq \epsilon$. We design an algorithm for this hypothesis testing problem with sample complexity $O((\sqrt{k}/\epsilon^2) 2^{d/2} \log^{2.5 d}(k/\epsilon))$ that runs in sample-polynomial time. Our algorithm is robust to model misspecification, i.e., succeeds even if $q$ is only promised to be {\em close} to a $k$-histogram. Moreover, for $k = 2^{\Omega(d)}$, we show a sample complexity lower bound of $(\sqrt{k}/\epsilon^2) \cdot \Omega(\log(k)/d)^{d-1}$ when $d\geq 2$. That is, for any fixed dimension $d$, our upper and lower bounds are nearly matching. Prior to our work, the sample complexity of the $d=1$ case was well-understood, but no algorithm with sub-learning sample complexity was known, even for $d=2$. Our new upper and lower bounds have interesting conceptual implications regarding the relation between learning and testing in this setting.},

In particular, we show that it is not possible to obtain a polylogarithmic (in the sequential complexity of the problem) number of parallel rounds with a polynomial (in the dimension) number of queries per round. In the majority of these settings and when the dimension of the space is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy, our lower bounds match the oracle complexity of sequential convex optimization, up to at most a logarithmic factor in the dimension, which makes them (nearly) tight.

 abstract = {We study the logistic bandit, in which rewards are binary with success probability $\exp(\beta a^\top \theta) / (1 + \exp(\beta a^\top \theta))$ and actions $a$ and coefficients $\theta$ are within the $d$-dimensional unit ball. While prior regret bounds for algorithms that address the logistic bandit exhibit exponential dependence on the slope parameter $\beta$, we establish a regret bound for Thompson sampling that is independent of $\beta$. Specifically, we establish that, when the set of feasible actions is identical to the set of possible coefficient vectors, the Bayesian regret of Thompson sampling is $\tilde{O}(d\sqrt{T})$. We also establish a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d\eta T}/\lambda)$ bound that applies more broadly, where $\lambda$ is the worst-case optimal log-odds and $\eta$ is the dimension, a new statistic we define to capture the degree to which an optimal action for one model fails to satisfice for others. We demonstrate that the fragility dimension plays an essential role by showing that, for any $\epsilon > 0$, no algorithm can achieve $\mathrm{poly}(d, 1/\lambda)\cdot T^{1-\epsilon}$ regret.},

This result subverts the classical belief that SGD requires at least $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ stochastic gradient computations for obtaining an $(\epsilon,O(\epsilon^{0.5}))$-approximate second-order stationary point. Such SGD rate matches, up to a polylogarithmic factor of problem-dependent parameters, the rate of most accelerated nonconvex stochastic optimization algorithms that adopt additional techniques, such as Nesterov's momentum acceleration, negative curvature search, as well as quadratic and cubic regularization tricks. Our novel analysis gives new insights into nonconvex SGD and can be potentially generalized to a broad class of stochastic optimization algorithms.},

This bound matches the minimax lower bound on the optimal Bayes error rate for this problem, and improves upon existing results that are sub-optimal by a multiplicative constant in the exponent. As a corollary, our result implies that SDP achieves the optimal exact recovery threshold with the correct leading constant. We further show that this error rate of SDP is robust; that is, it remains unchanged under the so-called semirandom model where the graph is modified by a monotone adversary, as well as under the setting with heterogeneous edge probabilities. Our proof is based on a novel primal-dual analysis of the SDP.},

 abstract = {Algorithmic stability is a classical approach to understanding and analysis of the generalization error of learning algorithms. A notable weakness of most stability-based generalization bounds is that they hold only in expectation. Generalization with high probability has been established in a landmark paper of Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002) albeit at the expense of an additional $\sqrt{n}$ factor in the bound. Specifically, their bound on the estimation error of any $γ$-uniformly stable learning algorithm on $n$ samples and range in $[0,1]$ is $O(γ\sqrt{n \log(1/δ)} + \sqrt{\log(1/δ)/n})$ with probability $\geq 1-δ$. The $\sqrt{n}$ overhead makes the bound vacuous in the common settings where $γ\geq 1/\sqrt{n}$. A stronger bound was recently proved by the authors (Feldman and Vondrak, 2018) that reduces the overhead to at most $O(n^{1/4})$. Still, both of these results give optimal generalization bounds only when $γ= O(1/n)$. We prove a nearly tight bound of $O(γ\log(n)\log(n/δ) + \sqrt{\log(1/δ)/n})$ on the estimation error of any $γ$-uniformly stable algorithm. It implies that for algorithms that are uniformly stable with $γ= O(1/\sqrt{n})$, estimation error is essentially the same as the sampling error. Our result leads to the first high-probability generalization bounds for multi-pass stochastic gradient descent and regularized ERM for stochastic convex problems with nearly optimal rate --- resolving open problems in prior work. Our proof technique is new and we introduce several analysis tools that might find additional applications.},

 abstract = {We study tensor completion in the agnostic setting. In the classical tensor completion problem, we receive $n$ entries of an unknown rank-$r$ tensor and wish to exactly complete the remaining entries. In agnostic tensor completion, we make no assumption on the rank of the unknown tensor, but attempt to predict unknown entries as well as the best rank-$r$ tensor. For agnostic learning of third-order tensors with the square loss, we give the first polynomial time algorithm that obtains a "fast" (i.e., $O(1/n)$-type) rate improving over the rate obtained by reduction to matrix completion. Our prediction error rate to compete with the best $d\times{}d\times{}d$ tensor of rank-$r$ is $\tilde{O}(r^{2}d^{3/2}/n)$. We also obtain an exact oracle inequality that trades off estimation and approximation error. Our algorithm is based on the degree-six sum-of-squares relaxation of the tensor nuclear norm. The key feature of our analysis is to show that a certain characterization for the subgradient of the tensor nuclear norm can be encoded in the sum-of-squares proof system. This unlocks the standard toolbox for localization of empirical processes under the square loss, and allows us to establish restricted eigenvalue-type guarantees for various tensor regression models, with tensor completion as a special case. The new analysis of the relaxation complements Barak and Moitra (2016), who gave slow rates for agnostic tensor completion, and Potechin and Steurer (2017), who gave exact recovery guarantees for the noiseless setting. Our techniques are user-friendly, and we anticipate that they will find use elsewhere.},

 abstract = {We give nearly matching upper and lower bounds on the oracle complexity of finding $\epsilon$-stationary points ($\| \nabla F(x) \| \leq\epsilon$) in stochastic convex optimization. We jointly analyze the oracle complexity in both the local stochastic oracle model and the global oracle (or, statistical learning) model. This allows us to decompose the complexity of finding near-stationary points into optimization complexity and sample complexity, and reveals some surprising differences between the complexity of stochastic optimization versus learning. Notably, we show that in the global oracle/statistical learning model, only logarithmic dependence on smoothness is required to find a near-stationary point, whereas polynomial dependence on smoothness is necessary in the local stochastic oracle model. In other words, the separation in complexity between the two models can be exponential, and that the folklore understanding that smoothness is required to find stationary points is only weakly true for statistical learning. 
Our upper bounds are based on extensions of a recent recursive regularization technique proposed by Allen-Zhu (2018). We show how to extend the technique to achieve near-optimal rates, and in particular show how to leverage the extra information available in the global oracle model. Our algorithm for the global model can be implemented efficiently through finite sum methods, and suggests an interesting new computational-statistical tradeoff.},

 abstract = {We provide excess risk guarantees for statistical learning in a setting where the population risk with respect to which we evaluate the target model depends on an unknown model that must be to be estimated from data (a ânuisance modelâ). We analyze a two-stage sample splitting meta-algorithm that takes as input two arbitrary estimation algorithms: one for the target model and one for the nuisance model. We show that if the population risk satisfies a condition called Neyman orthogonality, the impact of the nuisance estimation error on the excess risk bound achieved by the meta-algorithm is of second order. Our theorem is agnostic to the particular algorithms used for the target and nuisance and only makes an assumption on their individual performance. This enables the use of a plethora of existing results from statistical learning and machine learning literature to give new guarantees for learning with a nuisance component. Moreover, by focusing on excess risk rather than parameter estimation, we can give guarantees under weaker assumptions than in previous works and accommodate the case where the target parameter belongs to a complex nonparametric class. We characterize conditions on the metric entropy such that oracle ratesârates of the same order as if we knew the nuisance modelâare achieved. We also analyze the rates achieved by specific estimation algorithms such as variance-penalized empirical risk minimization, neural network estimation and sparse high-dimensional linear model estimation. We highlight the applicability of our results in four settings of central importance in the literature: 1) heterogeneous treatment effect estimation, 2) offline policy optimization, 3) domain adaptation, and 4) learning with missing data.},

 abstract = {In this paper we focus on the problem of Online Principal Component Analysis in the regret minimization framework. For this problem, all existing regret minimization algorithms for the fully-adversarial setting are based on a positive semidefinite convex relaxation, and hence require quadratic memory and SVD computation (either thin of full) on each iteration, which amounts to at least quadratic runtime per iteration. This is in stark contrast to a corresponding stochastic i.i.d. variant of the problem, which was studied extensively lately, and admits very efficient gradient ascent algorithms that work directly on the natural non-convex formulation of the problem, and hence require only linear memory and linear runtime per iteration. This raises the question: can non-convex online gradient ascent algorithms be shown to minimize regret in online adversarial settings? In this paper we take a step forward towards answering this question. We introduce an \textit{adversarially-perturbed spiked-covariance model} in which, each data point is assumed to follow a fixed stochastic distribution with a non-zero spectral gap in the covariance matrix, but is then perturbed with some adversarial vector. This model is a natural extension of a well studied standard stochastic setting that allows for non-stationary (adversarial) patterns to arise in the data and hence, might serve as a significantly better approximation for real-world data-streams. We show that in an interesting regime of parameters, when the non-convex online gradient ascent algorithm is initialized with a warm-start vector, it provably minimizes the regret with high probability. We further discuss the possibility of computing such a warm-start vector, and also the use of regularization to obtain fast regret rates. Our theoretical findings are supported by empirical experiments on both synthetic and real-world data.},

Our analysis focuses on improvements in the minimax learning rate in terms of the number of labeled examples (with the number of unlabeled examples being allowed to depend on the number of labeled ones). We argue that for such improvements to be realistic and indisputable, certain specific conditions should be satisfied and previous analyses have failed to meet those conditions. We then demonstrate examples where these conditions can be met, in particular showing rate changes from $1/\sqrt{\ell}$ to $e^{-c\ell}$ and from $1/\sqrt{\ell}$ to $1/\ell$.

Extensively studied computational problems such as convex optimization and sampling in convex sets also have meaningful counterparts in the manifold setting. Geodesically convex optimization is a well-studied problem with ongoing research and considerable recent interest in machine learning and theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study sampling and convex optimization problems over manifolds of non-negative curvature proving polynomial running time in the dimension and other relevant parameters. Our algorithms assume a warm start. We first present a random walk based sampling algorithm and then combine it with simulated annealing for solving convex optimization problems. To our knowledge, these are the first algorithms in the general setting of positively curved manifolds with provable polynomial guarantees under reasonable assumptions, and the first study of the connection between sampling and optimization in this setting.},

 abstract = {Consider the problem of minimizing functions that are Lipschitz and strongly convex, but not necessarily differentiable. We prove that after $T$ steps of stochastic gradient descent, the error of the final iterate is $O(\log(T)/T)$ with high probability. We also construct a function from this class for which the error of the final iterate of deterministic gradient descent is $\Omega(\log(T)/T)$. This shows that the upper bound is tight and that, in this setting, the last iterate of stochastic gradient descent has the same general error rate (with high probability) as deterministic gradient descent. This resolves both open questions posed by Shamir (2012). 
An intermediate step of our analysis proves that the suffix averaging method achieves error $O(1/T)$ with high probability, which is optimal (for any first-order optimization method). This improves results of Rakhlin (2012) and Hazan and Kale (2014), both of which achieved error $O(1/T)$, but only in expectation, and achieved a high probability error bound of $O(\log \log(T)/T)$, which is suboptimal. 
We prove analogous results for functions that are Lipschitz and convex, but not necessarily strongly convex or differentiable. After $T$ steps of stochastic gradient descent, the error of the final iterate is $O(\log(T)/\sqrt{T})$ with high probability, and there exists a function for which the error of the final iterate of deterministic gradient descent is $\Omega(\log(T)/\sqrt{T})$.},

In this model, the agents receive private signals that are indicative of an unknown state of the world.  Then, they repeatedly announce the state of the world they consider most likely to their neighbors, at the same time updating their beliefs based on their neighborsâ announcements. This model is extensively studied in economics since the work of Aumann (1976) and Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1982). It is known that the agents eventually agree with high probability on any network. It is often argued that the computations needed by agents in this model are difficult, but prior to our results there was no rigorous work showing this hardness.  We show that it is  $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard for the agents to compute their actions in this model. Furthermore, we show that it is equally difficult even to approximate an agentâs posterior: It is $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hard to distinguish between the posterior being almost entirely concentrated on one state of the world or another.  },

 abstract = {Robust mean estimation is the problem of estimating the mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^d$ of a $d$-dimensional distribution $D$ from a list of independent samples, an $\epsilon$-fraction of which have been arbitrarily corrupted by a malicious adversary. Recent algorithmic progress has resulted in the first polynomial-time algorithms which achieve \emph{dimension-independent} rates of error: for instance, if $D$ has covariance $I$, in polynomial-time one may find $\hat{\mu}$ with $\|\mu - \hat{\mu}\| \leq O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$. However, error rates achieved by current polynomial-time algorithms, while dimension-independent, are sub-optimal in many natural settings, such as when $D$ is sub-Gaussian, or has bounded $4$-th moments. In this work we give worst-case complexity-theoretic evidence that improving on the error rates of current polynomial-time algorithms for robust mean estimation may be computationally intractable in natural settings. We show that several natural approaches to improving error rates of current polynomial-time robust mean estimation algorithms would imply efficient algorithms for the small-set expansion problem, refuting Raghavendra and Steurer's small-set expansion hypothesis (so long as $P \neq NP$). We also give the first direct reduction to the robust mean estimation problem, starting from a plausible but nonstandard variant of the small-set expansion problem.},

Our algorithm is robust to adversarial perturbations of bounded spectral norm. Our algorithm is inspired by one which uses the sum-of-squares semidefinite programming hierarchy (Ma, Shi, and Steurer STOC'16, arXiv:1610.01980), and we achieve comparable robustness and overcompleteness guarantees under similar algebraic assumptions. However, our algorithm avoids semidefinite programming and may be implemented as a series of basic linear-algebraic operations. We consequently obtain a much faster running time than semidefinite programming methods: our algorithm runs in time $\tilde O(n^2d^3) \le \tilde O(d^7)$, which is subquadratic in the input size $d^4$ (where we have suppressed factors related to the condition number of the input tensor).},

Such matrices arise in various computational contexts such as learning image manifolds, handwriting recognition, and multi-dimensional unfolding. 
In this work we study algorithms for low-rank approximation of distance matrices. Recent work by Bakshi and Woodruff (NeurIPS 2018) showed it is possible to compute a rank-$k$ approximation of a distance matrix in time $O((n+m)^{1+\gamma}) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$, where $\epsilon>0$ is an error parameter and $\gamma>0$ is an arbitrarily small constant. Notably, their bound is sublinear in the matrix size, which is unachievable for general matrices. 
We present an algorithm that is both simpler and more efficient. It reads only $O((n+m) k/\epsilon)$ entries of the input matrix, and has a running time of $O(n+m) \cdot \mathrm{poly}(k,1/\epsilon)$. We complement the sample complexity of our algorithm with a matching lower bound on the number of entries that must be read by any algorithm. We provide experimental results to validate the approximation quality and running time of our algorithm.},

 abstract = {This paper is concerned with finding an optimal algorithm for minimizing a composite convex objective function. The basic setting is that the objective is the sum of two convex functions: the first function is smooth with up to the d-th order derivative information available, and the second function is possibly non-smooth, but its proximal tensor mappings can be computed approximately in an efficient manner. The problem is to find -- in that setting -- the best possible (optimal) iteration complexity for convex optimization. Along that line, for the smooth case (without the second non-smooth part in the objective), Nesterov (1983) proposed an optimal algorithm for the first-order methods (d=1) with iteration complexity O( 1 / k^2 ). A high-order tensor algorithm with iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{d+1} ) was proposed by Baes (2009) and Nesterov (2018). In this paper, we propose a new high-order tensor algorithm for the general composite case, with the iteration complexity of O( 1 / k^{(3d+1)/2} ), which matches the lower bound for the d-th order methods as established in Nesterov (2018), and Shamir et al. (2018), and hence is optimal. Our approach is based on the Accelerated Hybrid Proximal Extragradient (A-HPE) framework proposed in Monteiro and Svaiter (2013), where a bisection procedure is installed for each A-HPE iteration. At each bisection step a proximal tensor subproblem is approximately solved, and the total number of bisection steps per A-HPE iteration is bounded by a logarithmic factor in the precision required.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with sub-exponential noise, a strictly more general problem than the standard OCO. In this setting, the learner receives a subgradient of the loss functions corrupted by sub-exponential noise and strives to achieve optimal regret guarantee, without knowledge of the competitor norm, i.e., in a parameter-free way. Recently, Cutkosky and Boahen (COLT 2017) proved that, given unbounded subgradients, it is impossible to guarantee a sublinear regret due to an exponential penalty. This paper shows that it is possible to go around the lower bound by allowing the observed subgradients to be unbounded via stochastic noise. However, the presence of unbounded noise in unconstrained OCO is challenging; existing algorithms do not provide near-optimal regret bounds or fail to have a guarantee. So, we design a novel parameter-free OCO algorithm for Banach space, which we call BANCO, via a reduction to betting on noisy coins. We show that BANCO achieves the optimal regret rate in our problem. Finally, we show the application of our results to obtain a parameter-free locally private stochastic subgradient descent algorithm, and the connection to the law of iterated logarithms.},

We study this as a pure exploration problem in multi armed bandit settings and develop sample complexity bounds on the total mean number of samples required for identifying the correct partition with high probability. This framework subsumes well studied problems such as finding the best arm or the best few arms. We consider distributions belonging to the single parameter exponential family and primarily consider partitions where the vector of means of arms lie either in a given set or its complement. The sets considered correspond to distributions where there exists a mean above a specified threshold, where the set is a half space and where either the set or its complement is a polytope, or more generally, a convex set. In these settings, we characterize the lower bounds on mean number of samples for each arm highlighting their dependence on the problem geometry. Further, inspired by the lower bounds, we propose algorithms that can match these bounds asymptotically with decreasing probability of error. Applications of this framework may be diverse. We briefly discuss one associated with finance.},

 abstract = {This work introduces a model of distributed learning in the spirit of Yao's communication complexity model. We consider a two-party setting, where each of the players gets a list of labelled examplesand they communicate in order to jointly perform some learning task. To naturally fit into the framework of learning theory, we allow the players to send each other labelled examples, where each example costs one unit of communication. This model can also be thought of as a distributed version of sample compression schemes. 
We study several fundamental questions in this model. For example, we define the analogues of the complexity classes P, NP and coNP, and show that in this model P equals the intersection of NP and coNP. The proof does not seem to follow from the analogous statement in classical communication complexity; in particular, our proof uses different techniques, including boosting and metric properties of VC classes. 
This framework allows to prove, in the context of distributed learning, unconditional separations between various learning contexts, like realizable versus agnostic learning, and proper versus improper learning. The proofs here are based on standard ideas from communication complexity as well as learning theory and geometric constructions in Euclidean space. As a corollary, we also obtain lower bounds that match the performance of algorithms from previous works on distributed classification.},

These restrictions are all essentially relaxed in this work. In particular, we analyze a general SA scheme to minimize a non-convex, smooth objective function. We consider update procedure whose drift term depends on a state-dependent Markov chain and the mean field is not necessarily of gradient type, covering approximate second-order method and allowing asymptotic bias for the one-step updates.

Our results prove the existence of epsilon-approximation O(sqrt{d}/epsilon) sized coresets for the above problems. This resolves the long-standing open problem regarding the coreset complexity of Gaussian kernel density estimation. We provide two more related but independent results. First, an exponential improvement of the widely used merge-and-reduce trick which gives improved streaming sketches for any low discrepancy problem. Second, an extremely simple deterministic algorithm for finding low discrepancy sequences (and therefore coresets) for any positive semi-definite kernel.

We obtain two qualitatively different regret bounds: one competes with a smoothed version of the policy class under no continuity assumptions, while the other requires standard Lipschitz assumptions. Both bounds exhibit data-dependent “zooming” behavior and, with no tuning, yield improved guarantees for benign problems. We also study adapting to unknown smoothness parameters, establishing a price-of-adaptivity and deriving optimal adaptive algorithms that require no additional information.},

 abstract = {Gibbs-ERM learning is a natural idealized model of learning with stochastic optimization algorithms (such as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics and ---to some extent--- Stochastic Gradient Descent), while it also arises in other contexts, including PAC-Bayesian theory, and sampling mechanisms. In this work we study the excess risk suffered by a Gibbs-ERM learner that uses non-convex, regularized empirical risk with the goal to understand the interplay between the data-generating distribution and learning in large hypothesis spaces. Our main results are distribution-dependent upper bounds on several notions of excess risk. We show that, in all cases, the distribution-dependent excess risk is essentially controlled by the effective dimension $\mathrm{tr}\left(\boldsymbol{H}^{\star} (\boldsymbol{H}^{\star} + λ\boldsymbol{I})^{-1}\right)$ of the problem, where $\boldsymbol{H}^{\star}$ is the Hessian matrix of the risk at a local minimum. This is a well-established notion of effective dimension appearing in several previous works, including the analyses of SGD and ridge regression, but ours is the first work that brings this dimension to the analysis of learning using Gibbs densities. The distribution-dependent view we advocate here improves upon earlier results of Raginsky et al. (2017), and can yield much tighter bounds depending on the interplay between the data-generating distribution and the loss function. The first part of our analysis focuses on the localized excess risk in the vicinity of a fixed local minimizer. This result is then extended to bounds on the global excess risk, by characterizing probabilities of local minima (and their complement) under Gibbs densities, a results which might be of independent interest.},

 abstract = {The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is perhaps the most broadly used algorithm for inference of latent variable problems. A theoretical understanding of its performance, however, largely remains lacking. Recent results established that EM enjoys global convergence for Gaussian Mixture Models. For Mixed Linear Regression, however, only local convergence results have been established, and those only for the high SNR regime. We show here that EM converges for mixed linear regression with two components (it is known that it may fail to converge for three or more), and moreover that this convergence holds for random initialization. Our analysis reveals that EM exhibits very different behavior in Mixed Linear Regression from its behavior in Gaussian Mixture Models, and hence our proofs require the development of several new ideas.},

We then generalise the information-theoretic tools of Russo and Van Roy (2016) for proving Bayesian regret bounds and combine them with the minimax theorem to derive minimax regret bounds for various partial monitoring settings. The highlight is a clean analysis of `non-degenerate easy' and `hard' finite partial monitoring, with new regret bounds that are independent of arbitrarily large game-dependent constants. The power of the generalised machinery is further demonstrated by proving that the minimax regret for k-armed adversarial bandits is at most sqrt{2kn}, improving on existing results by a factor of 2. Finally, we provide a simple analysis of the cops and robbers game, also improving best known constants.},

 abstract = {Many convex problems in machine learning and computer science share the same form: \begin{align*} \min_{x} \sum_{i} f_i( A_i x + b_i), \end{align*} where $f_i$ are convex functions on $\mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ with constant $n_i$, $A_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d}$, $b_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i}$ and $\sum_i n_i = n$. This problem generalizes linear programming and includes many problems in empirical risk minimization. In this paper, we give an algorithm that runs in time \begin{align*} O^* ( ( n^{\omega} + n^{2.5 - \alpha/2} + n^{2+ 1/6} ) \log (n / \delta) ) \end{align*} where $\omega$ is the exponent of matrix multiplication, $\alpha$ is the dual exponent of matrix multiplication, and $\delta$ is the relative accuracy. Note that the runtime has only a log dependence on the condition numbers or other data dependent parameters and these are captured in $\delta$. For the current bound $\omega \sim 2.38$ [Vassilevska Williams'12, Le Gall'14] and $\alpha \sim 0.31$ [Le Gall, Urrutia'18], our runtime $O^* ( n^{\omega} \log (n / \delta))$ matches the current best for solving a dense least squares regression problem, a special case of the problem we consider. Very recently, [Alman'18] proved that all the current known techniques can not give a better $\omega$ below $2.168$ which is larger than our $2+1/6$. Our result generalizes the very recent result of solving linear programs in the current matrix multiplication time [Cohen, Lee, Song'19] to a more broad class of problems. Our algorithm proposes two concepts which are different from [Cohen, Lee, Song'19] : 
$\bullet$ We give a robust deterministic central path method, whereas the previous one is a stochastic central path which updates weights by a random sparse vector. 
$\bullet$ We propose an efficient data-structure to maintain the central path of interior point methods even when the weights update vector is dense.},

When $\Phi(M) = Determinant(M)^{1/d}$, the problem is known as the D-optimal design problem, and when $\Phi(M) = Trace(M)$, it is known as the A-optimal design problem. One of the most common heuristics used in practice to solve these problems is the local search heuristic, also known as the Fedorovâs exchange method (Fedorov, 1972). This is due to its simplicity and its empirical performance (Cook and Nachtrheim, 1980; Miller and Nguyen, 1994; Atkinson et al., 2007).  However, despite its wide usage no theoretical bound has been proven for this algorithm. In this paper, we bridge this gap and prove approximation guarantees for the local search algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems. We show that the local search algorithms are asymptotically optimal when $\frac{k}{d}$ is large. In addition to this, we also prove similar approximation guarantees for the greedy algorithms for D-optimal design and A-optimal design problems when $\frac{k}{d}$ is large.},

 abstract = {The Langevin Markov chain algorithms are widely deployed methods to sample from distributions in challenging high-dimensional and non-convex statistics and machine learning applications. Despite this, current bounds for the Langevin algorithms are slower than those of competing algorithms in many important situations, for instance when sampling from weakly log-concave distributions, or when sampling or optimizing non-convex log-densities. In this paper, we obtain improved bounds in many of these situations, showing that the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) is faster than the best bounds for its competitor algorithms when the target distribution satisfies weak third- and fourth- order regularity properties associated with the input data. In many settings, our regularity conditions are weaker than the usual Euclidean operator norm regularity properties, allowing us to show faster bounds for a much larger class of distributions than would be possible with the usual Euclidean operator norm approach, including in statistics and machine learning applications where the data satisfy a certain incoherence condition. In particular, we show that using our regularity conditions one can obtain faster bounds for applications which include sampling problems in Bayesian logistic regression with weakly convex priors, and the nonconvex optimization problem of learning linear classifiers with zero-one loss functions. 
Our main technical contribution in this paper is our analysis of the Metropolis acceptance probability of MALA in terms of its energy-conservation error, and our bound for this error in terms of third- and fourth- order regularity conditions. Our combination of this higher-order analysis of the energy conservation error with the conductance method is key to obtaining bounds which have a sub-linear dependence on the dimension $d$ in the non-strongly logconcave setting.},

Motivated by a problem of communication security, we focus on planted structures that consist in a tree graph. For planted line graphs, we establish the following phase diagram. In a low density region where the average degree $\lambda$ of the initial graph is below some critical value $\lambda_c=1$, detection and reconstruction go from impossible to easy as the line length $K$ crosses some critical value $f(\lambda)\ln(n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph. In the high density region $\lambda>\lambda_c$, detection goes from impossible to easy as $K$ goes from $o(\sqrt{n})$ to $\omega(\sqrt{n})$, and reconstruction remains impossible so long as $K=o(n)$. For $D$-ary trees of varying depth $h$ and $2\le D\le O(1)$, we identify a low-density region $\lambda<\lambda_D$, such that the following holds. There is a threshold $h*=g(D)\ln(\ln(n))$ with the following properties. Detection goes from feasible to impossible as $h$ crosses $h*$. We also show that only partial reconstruction is feasible at best for $h\ge h*$. We conjecture a similar picture to hold for $D$-ary trees as for lines in the high-density region $\lambda>\lambda_D$, but confirm only the following part of this picture: Detection is easy for $D$-ary trees of size $\omega(\sqrt{n})$, while at best only partial reconstruction is feasible for $D$-ary trees of any size $o(n)$. These results are in contrast with the corresponding picture for detection and reconstruction of {\em low rank} planted structures, such as dense subgraphs and block communities: We observe a discrepancy between detection and reconstruction, the latter being impossible for a wide range of parameters where detection is easy. This property does not hold for previously studied low rank planted structures.},

 abstract = {We consider learning two layer neural networks using stochastic gradient descent. The mean-field description of this learning dynamics approximates the evolution of the network weights by an evolution in the space of probability distributions in $R^D$ (where $D$ is the number of parameters associated to each neuron). This evolution can be defined through a partial differential equation or, equivalently, as the gradient flow in the Wasserstein space of probability distributions. Earlier work shows that (under some regularity assumptions), the mean field description is accurate as soon as the number of hidden units is much larger than the dimension $D$. In this paper we establish stronger and more general approximation guarantees. First of all, we show that the number of hidden units only needs to be larger than a quantity dependent on the regularity properties of the data, and independent of the dimensions. Next, we generalize this analysis to the case of unbounded activation functions, which was not covered by earlier bounds. We extend our results to noisy stochastic gradient descent. Finally, we show that kernel ridge regression can be recovered as a special limit of the mean field analysis.},

 abstract = {We consider the combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem, where the reward function is nonlinear. In this setting, the agent chooses a batch of arms on each round and receives feedback from each arm of the batch. The reward that the agent aims to maximize is a function of the selected arms and their expectations. In many applications, the reward function is highly nonlinear, and the performance of existing algorithms relies on a global Lipschitz constant to encapsulate the function's nonlinearity. This may lead to loose regret bounds, since by itself, a large gradient does not necessarily cause a large regret, but only in regions where the uncertainty in the reward's parameters is high. To overcome this problem, we introduce a new smoothness criterion, which we term \emph{Gini-weighted smoothness}, that takes into account both the nonlinearity of the reward and concentration properties of the arms. We show that a linear dependence of the regret in the batch size in existing algorithms can be replaced by this smoothness parameter. This, in turn, leads to much tighter regret bounds when the smoothness parameter is batch-size independent. For example, in the probabilistic maximum coverage (PMC) problem, that has many applications, including influence maximization, diverse recommendations and more, we achieve dramatic improvements in the upper bounds. We also prove matching lower bounds for the PMC problem and show that our algorithm is tight, up to a logarithmic factor in the problem's parameters.},

A fundamental obstacle that comes up in the design of such adaptive algorithms is to calibrate
a so-called step-size or learning rate hyperparameter depending on variance, gradient norms, etc.
A recent technique promises to overcome this difficulty by maintaining multiple learning rates in
parallel. This technique has been applied in the MetaGrad algorithm for online convex optimization
and the Squint algorithm for prediction with expert advice. However, in both cases the user still has
to provide in advance a Lipschitz hyperparameter that bounds the norm of the gradients. Although
this hyperparameter is typically not available in advance, tuning it correctly is crucial: if it is set
too small, the methods may fail completely; but if it is taken too large, performance deteriorates
significantly. In the present work we remove this Lipschitz hyperparameter by designing new
versions of MetaGrad and Squint that adapt to its optimal value automatically. We achieve this
by dynamically updating the set of active learning rates. For MetaGrad, we further improve the
computational efficiency of handling constraints on the domain of prediction, and we remove the
need to specify the number of rounds in advance.},

More generally, we can allow for regularization with level $λ$, then $d$ gets replaced with the degrees of freedom number. Denoting $\text{cond}(\mathbf{S})$ the condition number of $\mathbf{S}$, the computational cost of the novel estimator is $O(d^2 n + d^3\log(\text{cond}(\mathbf{S})))$, which is comparable to the cost of the sample covariance estimator in the statistically interesing regime $n \ge d$. We consider applications of our estimator to eigenvalue estimation with relative error, and to ridge regression with heavy-tailed random design.},

In a S-MAB, pulling an arm can result in both positive and negative rewards. The agent has an initial budget that evolves in time with the received rewards. The goal is finding a good exploration-exploitationsafety trade-off, maximizing rewards while minimizing the probability of getting ruined (i.e. hitting a negative budget). Such simple and until now neglected modification in the MAB statement changes the way to approach the problem, asking for adapted algorithms and specific analytical tools, and also make it more likely related to some important real-world applications. We are interested in the following open problems which stem from such new MAB definition: (a) how can the regret be meaningfully defined in formal terms for a S-MAB given its multiobjective optimization nature? (b) can a S-MAB be reduced to a RA-MAB or a B-MAB, transferring their theoretical guarantees? (c) what kind of method or strategy must an agent follow to optimally solve a S-MAB?},

 abstract = {We consider a model of selective prediction, where the prediction algorithm is given a data sequence in an online fashion and asked to predict a pre-specified statistic of the upcoming data points. The algorithm is allowed to choose when to make the prediction as well as the length of the prediction window, possibly depending on the observations so far. We prove that, even without any distributional assumption on the input data stream, a large family of statistics can be estimated to non-trivial accuracy. To give one concrete example, suppose that we are given access to an arbitrary binary sequence $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of length $n$. Our goal is to accurately predict the average observation, and we are allowed to choose the window over which the prediction is made: for some $t < n$ and $m \le n - t$, after seeing $t$ observations we predict the average of $x_{t+1}, \ldots, x_{t+m}$. This particular problem was first studied in Drucker (2013) and referred to as the density prediction game. We show that the expected squared error of our prediction can be bounded by $O(\frac{1}{\log n})$ and prove a matching lower bound, which resolves an open question raised in Drucker (2013). This result holds for any sequence (that is not adaptive to when the prediction is made, or the predicted value), and the expectation of the error is with respect to the randomness of the prediction algorithm. Our results apply to more general statistics of a sequence of observations, and we highlight several open directions for future work.},

In order to obtain finite sample rates, previous approaches to classification with unknown class-conditional label noise have required that the regression function is close to its extrema on sets of large measure. We shall consider this problem in the setting of non-compact metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its extrema. 
In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up to logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour: When the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate, the optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In addition, we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates without prior knowledge of either the distributional parameters or the local density. This identifies for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without label noise.},

A closely related hypothesis testing problem is to distinguish the pair $(X,Y)$ generated from this structured model from a corresponding null model where $(X,Y)$ consist of purely independent Gaussian entries. In the low sparsity $k=o(p)$ and high signal to noise ratio $k/\sigma^2=\Omega\left(1\right)$ regime, we establish an `All-or-Nothing' information-theoretic phase transition at a critical sample size $n^*=2 k\log \left(p/k\right) /\log \left(1+k/\sigma^2\right)$, resolving a conjecture of \cite{gamarnikzadik}. Specifically, we show that if $\liminf_{p\to \infty} n/n^*>1$, then the maximum likelihood estimator almost perfectly recovers the hidden vector with high probability and moreover the true hypothesis can be detected with a vanishing error probability. Conversely, if $\limsup_{p\to \infty} n/n^*<1$, then it becomes information-theoretically impossible even to recover an arbitrarily small but fixed fraction of the hidden vector support, or to test hypotheses strictly better than random guess. 
Our proof of the impossibility result builds upon two key techniques, which could be of independent interest. First, we use a conditional second moment method to upper bound the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the structured and the null model. Second, inspired by the celebrated area theorem, we establish a lower bound to the minimum mean squared estimation error of the hidden vector in terms of the KL divergence between the two models.},

 abstract = {Existing depth separation results for constant-depth networks essentially show that certain radial functions in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be easily approximated with depth $3$ networks, cannot be approximated by depth $2$ networks, even up to constant accuracy, unless their size is exponential in $d$. However, the functions used to demonstrate this are rapidly oscillating, with a Lipschitz parameter scaling polynomially with the dimension $d$ (or equivalently, by scaling the function, the hardness result applies to $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz functions only when the target accuracy $\epsilon$ is at most $\text{poly}(1/d)$). In this paper, we study whether such depth separations might still hold in the natural setting of $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions, when $\epsilon$ does not scale with $d$. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the answer is negative: In contrast to the intuition suggested by previous work, it \emph{is} possible to approximate $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz radial functions with depth $2$, size $\text{poly}(d)$ networks, for every constant $\epsilon$. We complement it by showing that approximating such functions is also possible with depth $2$, size $\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ networks, for every constant $d$. Finally, we show that it is not possible to have polynomial dependence in both $d,1/\epsilon$ simultaneously. Overall, our results indicate that in order to show depth separations for expressing $\mathcal{O}(1)$-Lipschitz functions with constant accuracy -- if at all possible -- one would need fundamentally different techniques than existing ones in the literature.},

We obtain finite-time bounds on the mean-square error in the case of constant step-size algorithms by considering the drift of an appropriately chosen Lyapunov function. The Lyapunov function can be interpreted either in terms of Steinâs method to obtain bounds on steady-state performance or in terms of Lyapunov stability theory for linear ODEs. We also provide a comprehensive treatment of the moments of the square of the 2-norm of the approximation error. Our analysis yields the following results: (i) for a given step-size, we show that the lower-order moments can be made small as a function of the step-size and can be upper-bounded by the moments of a Gaussian random variable; (ii) we show that the higher-order moments beyond a threshold may be infinite in steady-state; and (iii) we characterize the number of samples needed for the finite-time bounds to be of the same order as the steady-state bounds.

 abstract = {The present work is concerned with community detection. Specifically, we consider a random graph drawn according to the stochastic block model~: its vertex set is partitioned into blocks, or communities, and edges are placed randomly and independently of each other with probability depending only on the communities of their two endpoints. In this context, our aim is to recover the community labels better than by random guess, based only on the observation of the graph. In the sparse case, where edge probabilities are in $O(1/n)$, we introduce a new spectral method based on the distance matrix $D^{(l)}$, where $D^{(l)}_{ij} = 1$ iff the graph distance between $i$ and $j$, noted $d(i, j)$ is equal to $\ell$. We show that when $\ell \sim c\log(n)$ for carefully chosen $c$, the eigenvectors associated to the largest eigenvalues of $D^{(l)}$ provide enough information to perform non-trivial community recovery with high probability, provided we are above the so-called Kesten-Stigum threshold. This yields an efficient algorithm for community detection, since computation of the matrix $D^{(l)}$ can be done in $O(n^{1+\kappa})$ operations for a small constant $\kappa$. We then study the sensitivity of the eigendecomposition of $D^{(l)}$ when we allow an adversarial perturbation of the edges of $G$. We show that when the considered perturbation does not affect more than $O(n^\varepsilon)$ vertices for some small $\varepsilon > 0$, the highest eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors incur negligible perturbations, which allows us to still perform efficient recovery.},

While structural and computational properties of max-entropy distributions have been extensively studied, basic questions such as: Do max-entropy distributions over a large support (e.g., $2^m$) with a specified marginal vector have succinct descriptions (polynomial-size in the input description)? and: Are entropy maximizing distributions "stable" under the perturbation of the marginal vector? have resisted a rigorous resolution. Here we show that these questions are related and resolve both of them. Our main result shows a ${\rm poly}(m, \log 1/\varepsilon)$ bound on the bit complexity of $\varepsilon$-optimal dual solutions to the maximum entropy convex program -- for very general support sets and with no restriction on the marginal vector. Applications of this result include polynomial time algorithms to compute max-entropy distributions over several new and old polytopes for any marginal vector in a unified manner, a polynomial time algorithm to compute the Brascamp-Lieb constant in the rank-1 case. The proof of this result allows us to show that changing the marginal vector by $δ$ changes the max-entropy distribution in the total variation distance roughly by a factor of ${\rm poly}(m, \log 1/δ)\sqrtδ$ -- even when the size of the support set is exponential. Together, our results put max-entropy distributions on a mathematically sound footing -- these distributions are robust and computationally feasible models for data.},

We consider the oblivious adversary model, where the adversary corrupts a fraction of the responses in complete ignorance of the data. We provide a nearly linear time estimator which consistently estimates the true regression vector, even with $1-o(1)$ fraction of corruptions. Existing results in this setting either don't guarantee consistent estimates or can only handle a small fraction of corruptions. We also extend our estimator to robust sparse linear regression and show that similar guarantees hold in this setting. Finally, we apply our estimator to the problem of linear regression with heavy-tailed noise and show that our estimator consistently estimates the regression vector even when the noise has unbounded variance (e.g., Cauchy distribution), for which most existing results don't even apply. Our estimator is based on a novel variant of outlier removal via hard thresholding in which the threshold is chosen adaptively and crucially relies on randomness to escape bad fixed points of the non-convex hard thresholding operation.},

 abstract = {We study the sample complexity of model-based reinforcement learning (henceforth RL) in general contextual decision processes. We design new algorithms for RL with a generic model class and analyze their statistical properties. Our algorithms have sample complexity governed by a new structural parameter called the witness rank, which we show to be small in several settings of interest, including factored MDPs and reactive POMDPs. We also show that the witness rank of a problem is never larger than the recently proposed Bellman rank parameter governing the sample complexity of the model-free algorithm OLIVE (Jiang et al., 2017), the only other provably sample efficient algorithm at this level of generality. Focusing on the special case of factored MDPs, we prove an exponential lower bound for a general class of model-free approaches, including OLIVE, which when combined with our algorithmic results demonstrates exponential separation between model-based and model-free RL in some rich-observation settings.},

 abstract = {We provide a novel computer-assisted technique for systematically analyzing first-order methods for optimization. In contrast with previous works, the approach is particularly suited for handling sublinear convergence rates and stochastic oracles. The technique relies on semidefinite programming and potential functions. It allows simultaneously obtaining worst-case guarantees on the behavior of those algorithms, and assisting in choosing appropriate parameters for tuning their worst-case performances. The technique also benefits from comfortable tightness guarantees, meaning that unsatisfactory results can be improved only by changing the setting. We use the approach for analyzing deterministic and stochastic first-order methods under different assumptions on the nature of the stochastic noise. Among others, we treat unstructured noise with bounded variance, different noise models arising in over-parametrized expectation minimization problems, and randomized block-coordinate descent schemes.},

Motivated by recent empirical success of RL on continuous control tasks, we study the sample complexity of popular model-based and model-free algorithms on the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We show that for policy evaluation, a simple model-based plugin method requires asymptotically less samples than the classical least-squares temporal difference (LSTD) estimator to reach the same quality of solution; the sample complexity gap between the two methods can be at least a factor of state dimension. For policy evaluation, we study a simple family of problem instances and show that nominal (certainty equivalence principle) control also requires several factors of state and input dimension fewer samples than the policy gradient method to reach the same level of control performance on these instances. Furthermore, the gap persists even when employing commonly used baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical result which demonstrates a separation in the sample complexity between model-based and model-free methods on a continuous control task.},

We provide a unified viewpoint on both sampling and variational inference in such generative models through the lens of stochastic control. 
We quantify the expressiveness of diffusion-based generative models. Specifically, we show that one can efficiently sample from a wide class of terminal target distributions by choosing the drift of the latent diffusion from the class of multilayer feedforward neural nets, with the accuracy of sampling measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution. 
Finally, we present and analyze a scheme for unbiased simulation of generative models with latent diffusions and provide bounds on the variance of the resulting estimators. This scheme can be implemented as a deep generative model with a random number of layers.},

 abstract = {We study the complexity of training neural network models with one hidden nonlinear activation layer and an output weighted sum layer. We analyze Gradient Descent applied to learning a bounded target function on $n$ real-valued inputs. We give an agnostic learning guarantee for GD: starting from a randomly initialized network, it converges in mean squared loss to the minimum error (in $2$-norm) of the best approximation of the target function using a polynomial of degree at most $k$. Moreover, for any $k$, the size of the network and number of iterations needed are both bounded by $n^{O(k)}\log(1/\epsilon)$. In particular, this applies to training networks of unbiased sigmoids and ReLUs. We also rigorously explain the empirical finding that gradient descent discovers lower frequency Fourier components before higher frequency components. 
We complement this result with nearly matching lower bounds in the Statistical Query model. GD fits well in the SQ framework since each training step is determined by an expectation over the input distribution. We show that any SQ algorithm that achieves significant improvement over a constant function with queries of tolerance some inverse polynomial in the input dimensionality $n$ must use $n^{\Omega(k)}$ queries even when the target functions are restricted to a set of $n^{O(k)}$ degree-$k$ polynomials, and the input distribution is uniform over the unit sphere; for this class the information-theoretic lower bound is only $\Theta(k \log n)$. 
Our approach for both parts is based on spherical harmonics. We view gradient descent as an operator on the space of functions, and study its dynamics. An essential tool is the Funk-Hecke theorem, which explains the eigenfunctions of this operator in the case of the mean squared loss.},

 abstract = {The Wasserstein distances are a set of metrics on probability distributions
supported on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with applications throughout statistics and machine
learning. Often, such distances are used in the context of variational
problems, in which the statistician employs in place of an unknown measure a
proxy constructed on the basis of independent samples. This raises the basic
question of how well measures can be approximated in Wasserstein distance.
While it is known that an empirical measure comprising i.i.d. samples is
rate-optimal for general measures, no improved results were known for measures
possessing smooth densities. We prove the first minimax rates for estimation of
smooth densities for general Wasserstein distances, thereby showing how the
curse of dimensionality can be alleviated for sufficiently regular measures. We
also show how to construct discretely supported measures, suitable for
computational purposes, which enjoy improved rates. Our approach is based on
novel bounds between the Wasserstein distances and suitable Besov norms, which
may be of independent interest.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v99-wolfer19a,
 abstract = {We address the problem of estimating the mixing time $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ of an arbitrary ergodic finite-state Markov chain from a single trajectory of length $m$. The reversible case was addressed by Hsu et al. [2019], who left the general case as an open problem. In the reversible case, the analysis is greatly facilitated by the fact that the Markov operator is self-adjoint, and Weyl's inequality allows for a dimension-free perturbation analysis of the empirical eigenvalues. As Hsu et al. point out, in the absence of reversibility (which induces asymmetric pair probabilities matrices), the existing perturbation analysis has a worst-case exponential dependence on the number of states $d$. Furthermore, even if an eigenvalue perturbation analysis with better dependence on $d$ were available, in the non-reversible case the connection between the spectral gap and the mixing time is not nearly as straightforward as in the reversible case. Our key insight is to estimate the pseudo-spectral gap $\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$ instead, which allows us to overcome the loss of symmetry and to achieve a polynomial dependence on the minimal stationary probability $\pi_\star$ and $\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$. Additionally, in the reversible case, we obtain simultaneous nearly (up to logarithmic factors) minimax rates in $t_{\mathsf{mix}}$ and precision $\varepsilon$, closing a gap in Hsu et al., who treated $\varepsilon$ as constant in the lower bounds. Finally, we construct fully empirical confidence intervals for $\gamma_{\mathsf{ps}}$, which shrink to zero at a rate of roughly $1/\sqrt{m}$, and improve the state of the art in even the reversible case.},

 abstract = {Stochastic approximation (SA) is a classical approach for stochastic convex optimization. Previous studies have demonstrated that the convergence rate of SA can be improved by introducing either smoothness or strong convexity condition. In this paper, we make use of smoothness and strong convexity simultaneously to boost the convergence rate. Let $\lambda$ be the modulus of strong convexity, $\kappa$ be the condition number, $F_*$ be the minimal risk, and $\alpha>1$ be some small constant. First, we demonstrate that, in expectation, an $O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha] + \kappa F_*/T)$ risk bound is attainable when $T = \Omega(\kappa^\alpha)$. Thus, when $F_*$ is small, the convergence rate could be faster than $O(1/[\lambda T])$ and approaches $O(1/[\lambda T^\alpha])$ in the ideal case. Second, to further benefit from small risk, we show that, in expectation, an $O(1/2^{T/\kappa}+F_*)$ risk bound is achievable. Thus, the excess risk reduces exponentially until reaching $O(F_*)$, and if $F_*=0$, we obtain a global linear convergence. Finally, we emphasize that our proof is constructive and each risk bound is equipped with an efficient stochastic algorithm attaining that bound.},
