  abstract = 	 {Despite machine learning modelsâ success in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, predictions from these models frequently fail on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Prior works have focused on developing state-of-the-art methods for detecting OOD. The fundamental question of how OOD samples differ from in-distribution samples remains unanswered. This paper explores how data dynamics in training models can be used to understand the fundamental differences between OOD and in-distribution samples in extensive detail. We found that syntactic characteristics of the data samples that the model consistently predicts incorrectly in both OOD and in-distribution cases directly contradict each other. In addition, we observed preliminary evidence supporting the hypothesis that models are more likely to latch on trivial syntactic heuristics (e.g., overlap of words between two sentences) when making predictions on OOD samples. We hope our preliminary study accelerates the data-centric analysis on various machine learning phenomena.}

Therefore, a large body of research has focused on finding the optimal augmentation policy for a given task. Yet, RandAugment [2], a simple random augmentation policy, has recently been shown to outperform existing sophisticated policies. Only Adversarial AutoAugment (AdvAA) [11], an approach based on the idea of adversarial training, has shown to be better than RandAugment. In this paper, we show that random augmentations are still competitive compared to an optimal adversarial approach, as well as to simple curricula, and conjecture that the success of AdvAA is due to the stochasticity of the policy controller network, which introduces a mild form of curriculum.}

  abstract = 	 {Humans rely heavily on shape information to recognize objects. Conversely, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are biased more towards texture. This fact is perhaps the main reason why CNNs are susceptible to adversarial examples. Here, we explore how shape bias can be incorporated into CNNs to improve their robustness. Two algorithms are proposed, based on the observation that edges are invariant to moderate imperceptible perturbations. In the first one, a classifier is adversarially trained on images with the edge map as an additional channel. At inference time, the edge map is recomputed and concatenated to the image. In the second algorithm, a conditional GAN is trained to translate the edge maps, from clean and/or perturbed images, into clean images. The inference is done over the generated image corresponding to the inputâs edge map. A large number of experiments with more than 10 data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms against FGSM, $\ell_{\infty}$ PGD, Carlini-Wagner, Boundary, and adaptive attacks. Further, we show that edge information can a) benefit other adversarial training methods, b) be even more effective in conjunction with background subtraction, c) be used to defend against poisoning attacks, and d) make CNNs more robust against natural image corruptions such as motion blur, impulse noise, and JPEG compression, than CNNs trained solely on RGB images. From a broader perspective, our study suggests that CNNs do not adequately account for image structures and operations that are crucial for robustness.

However, it has been observed that they can assign higher likelihoods to out-of-distribution (OOD) data than in- distribution data, thus calling into question the meaning of these likelihood values. In this work we provide a novel perspective on this phenomenon, decomposing the average likelihood into a KL divergence term and an entropy term. We argue that the latter can explain the curious OOD behaviour mentioned above, suppressing likelihood values on datasets with higher entropy. Although our idea is simple, we have not seen it explored yet in the literature. This analysis provides further explanation for the success of OOD detection methods based on likelihood ratios, as the problematic entropy term cancels out in expectation. Finally, we discuss how this observation relates to recent success in OOD detection with manifold-supported models, for which the above decomposition does not hold.}

The validity of these simple power laws across orders of magnitude in model scale provides compelling evidence that larger models are also more capable models. However, scaling up models under the constraints of hardware and infrastructure is no easy feat, and rapidly becomes a hard and expensive engineering problem. We investigate ways to tentatively cheat scaling laws, and train larger models for cheaper. We emulate an increase in effective parameters, using efficient approximations: either by doping the models with frozen random parameters, or by using fast structured transforms in place of dense linear layers. We find that the scaling relationship between test loss and compute depends only on the actual number of trainable parameters; scaling laws cannot be deceived by spurious parameters.}

In applications, this approach simplifies configuration, avoiding careful feature extraction and large ML models. Our ablation studies confirm the value of individual enhancements we introduce. We show that Zest complements and can compete with language-specific multidimensional content embeddings in production, but cannot outperform other counting methods on public datasets.}

A nonlinear denoising stage maps spectrogram representations of arbitrary piano music with unknown timbral characteristics onto a canonical spectrogram representation with known timbral characteristics. A subsequent linear demixing stage aims to exploit the knowledge about the canonical timbral characteristics. The idea behind this two stage process is to try to elegantly sidestep any musical bias inherent in the training dataset that is easily picked up by a single stage, nonlinear (neural) transcription system (with large capacity). The two stage process tries not to force the nonlinear system to solve a combinatorial problem, which is more amenable to being solved by a linear decomposition method that has the superposition property. Using the simplest setup we could think of, we obtain (rather mixed (pun intended)) results on a standard polyphonic piano transcription dataset - the two stage process still suffers from generalization problems after the first stage, which the second stage is unable to compensate.}

We show that depth uncertainty networks operate in a low overfitting regime, much like underparameterised models. They should therefore see an increase in performance with bias correction. Surprisingly, they do not. We propose that this negative result, as well as the results Farquhar et al.

We study the benefits of these two inductive biases by comparing against baseline models that help disentangle the benefits of each. We find that capturing the graph structure is crucial for accurate in-domain probabilistic predictions and more sample efficient models. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that the continuous time evolution inductive bias brings little to no benefit despite reflecting the true probability dynamics.}
