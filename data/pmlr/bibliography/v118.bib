 abstract = {A simple and widely adopted approach to extend Gaussian processes (GPs) to multiple outputs is to model each output as a linear combination of a collection of shared, unobserved latent GPs. An issue with this approach is choosing the number of latent processes and their kernels. These choices are typically done manually, which can be time consuming and prone to human biases. We propose Gaussian Process Automatic Latent Process Selection (GP-ALPS), which automatically chooses the latent processes by turning off those that do not meaningfully contribute to explaining the data. We develop a variational inference scheme, assess the quality of the variational posterior by comparing it against the gold standard MCMC, and demonstrate the suitability of GP-ALPS in a set of preliminary experiments.},

 abstract = {In some misspecified settings, the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics may lead to inconsistent estimates. To fix this issue, it has been suggested to replace the likelihood by a pseudo-likelihood, that is the exponential of a loss function enjoying suitable robustness properties. In this paper, we build a pseudo-likelihood based on the Maximum Mean Discrepancy, defined via an embedding of probability distributions into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that this MMD-Bayes posterior is consistent and robust to model misspecification. As the posterior obtained in this way might be intractable, we also prove that reasonable variational approximations of this posterior enjoy the same properties. We provide details on a stochastic gradient algorithm to compute these variational approximations. Numerical simulations indeed suggest that our estimator is more robust to misspecification than the ones based on the likelihood.},

Some prominent examples are constrained-to-unconstrained transformations of distributions for use in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and constructing exible and learnable densities such as normalizing ows. We present Bijectors.jl, a software package in Julia for transforming distributions, available at github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl. The package provides a exible and composable way of implementing transformations of distributions without being tied to a computational framework. We demonstrate the use of Bijectors.jl on improving variational inference by encoding known statistical dependencies into the variational posterior using normalizing ows, providing a general approach to relaxing the mean-field assumption usually made in variational inference. },

In this work, we propose variational selective autoencoder (VSAE) for this task. Learning only from partially-observed data, VSAE can model the joint distribution of observed/unobserved modalities and the imputation mask, resulting in a unied model for various down-stream tasks including data generation and imputation. Evaluation on synthetic high-dimensional and challenging low-dimensional multimodal datasets shows improvement over the state-of-the-art imputation models. },

 abstract = {We study system design problems stated as parameterized stochastic programs with a chance-constraint set. We adopt a Bayesian approach that requires the computation of a posterior predictive integral which is usually intractable. In addition, for the problem to be a well-defined convex program, we must retain the convexity of the feasible set. Consequently, we propose a variational Bayes-based method to approximately compute the posterior predictive integral that ensures tractability and retains the convexity of the feasible set. Under certain regularity conditions, we also show that the solution set obtained using variational Bayes converges to the true solution set as the number of observations tends to infinity. We also provide bounds on the probability of qualifying a true infeasible point (with respect to the true constraints) as feasible under the VB approximation for a given number of samples.},

Here we develop a new approach, starting from posterior samples obtained with a standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We apply a novel Normalizing Flow (NF) approach to obtain an analytic density estimator from these samples, followed by Optimal Bridge Sampling (OBS) to obtain the normalizing constant. We compare our method which we call Gaussianized Bridge Sampling (GBS) to existing methods such as Nested Sampling (NS) and Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) on several examples, showing our method is both significantly faster and substantially more accurate than these methods, and comes with a reliable error estimation.},

 abstract = {Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function. The classical approach entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an approach called \textit{Type II maximum likelihood} or ML-II). An alternative learning procedure is to infer the posterior over hyperparameters in a hierarchical specification of GPs we call \textit{Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression} (GPR). This work considers two approximation schemes for the intractable hyperparameter posterior: 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling-based approximation and 2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full-rank Gaussian accounting for correlations between hyperparameters. We analyze the predictive performance for fully Bayesian GPR on a range of benchmark data sets.},

This technique provides a simple, general-purpose method for improving sequence modeling, with connections to existing and classical techniques. We demonstrate the proposed approach both with standalone flow-based models and as a component within sequential latent variable models. Results are presented on three benchmark video datasets and three other time series datasets, where autoregressive flow-based dynamics improve log-likelihood performance over baseline models.

The problem of distilling interpretable dynamics from pixels has been extensively considered through the lens of graphical/state space models (Fraccaro et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Pearce et al., 2018; Chiappa and Paquet, 2019) that exploit Markov structure for cheap computation and structured priors for enforcing interpretability on latent representations. We take a step towards extending these approaches by discarding the Markov structure; inspired by Gaussian process dynamical models (Wang et al., 2006), we instead repurpose the recently proposed Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (Casale et al., 2018) for learning interpretable latent dynamics. We describe the model and perform experiments on a synthetic dataset and see that the model reliably reconstructs smooth dynamics exhibiting U-turns and loops. We also observe that this model may be trained without any  annealing or freeze-thaw of training parameters in contrast to previous works, albeit for slightly dierent use cases, where application specic training tricks are often required.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v118-yacoby20a,
 abstract = {Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs) are deep generative latent variable models consisting of two components: a generative model that captures a data distribution p(x) by transforming a distribution p(z) over latent space, and an inference model that infers likely latent codes for each data point (Kingma and Welling, 2013). Recent work shows that traditional training methods tend to yield solutions that violate modeling desiderata: (1) the learned generative model captures the observed data distribution but does so while ignoring the latent codes, resulting in codes that do not represent the data (e.g. van den Oord et al. (2017); Kim et al. (2018)); (2) the aggregate of the learned latent codes does not match the prior p(z). This mismatch means that the learned generative model will be unable to generate realistic data with samples from p(z)(e.g. Makhzani et al. (2015); Tomczak and Welling (2017)). In this paper, we demonstrate that both issues stem from the fact that the global optima of the VAE training objective often correspond to undesirable solutions. Our analysis builds on two observations: (1) the generative model is unidentifiable - there exist many generative models that explain the data equally well, each with different (and potentially unwanted) properties and (2) bias in the VAE objective - the VAE objective may prefer generative models that explain the data poorly but have posteriors that are easy to approximate. We present a novel inference method, LiBI, mitigating the problems identified in our analysis. On synthetic datasets, we show that LiBI can learn generative models that capture the data distribution and inference models that better satisfy modeling assumptions when traditional methods struggle to do so.},

 abstract = { Comparing the inferences of diverse candidate models is an essential part of model checking and escaping local optima. To enable efficient comparison, we introduce an amortized variational inference framework that can perform fast and reliable posterior estimation across models of the same architecture. Our Any Parameter Encoder (APE) extends the encoder neural network common in amortized inference to take both a data feature vector and a model parameter vector as input. APE thus reduces posterior inference across unseen data and models to a single forward pass. In experiments comparing candidate topic models for synthetic data and product reviews, our Any Parameter Encoder yields comparable posteriors to more expensive methods in far less time, especially when the encoder architecture is designed in model-aware fashion.},
