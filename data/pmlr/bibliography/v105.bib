 abstract = {We consider the framework of competitive prediction
when one provides guarantees compared to other predictive models that are called experts.
We propose the algorithm that combines point predictions of an infinite pool of linear experts
and outputs probability forecasts in the form of cumulative distribution functions.
We evaluate the quality of probabilistic prediction by the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS),
which is a widely used proper scoring rule.
We provide a strategy that allows us to âtrack the best expertâ
and derive the theoretical bound on the discounted loss of the strategy.
Experimental results on synthetic data and solar power data show
that the theoretical bounds of our algorithm are not violated.
Also the algorithm performs close to and sometimes outperforms the retrospectively best quantile regression.},

for providing confidence measures to assist a Brain Machine Interface (BMI)
in the task of controlling an exoskeleton using electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrooculogram (EOG) clips.
Reliable and accurate control of assistive robotics is still an important challenge
because of the noisy nature of EEGâs and EOGâs
and the fact that any misclassification can lead to unwanted actions and serious safety risks.
Therefore a technique that will compliment predictions with a well-calibrated indication of how correct they are,
should be very beneficial for the particular application as it can significantly enhance safety.
Our approach consists of an Inductive Conformal Predictor (ICP)
built on top of a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) Neural Network.
We conduct experiments on a dataset consisting of EEG and EOG data
collected from one subject with a high spinal cord lesion.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v105-morsomme19a,
 abstract = {Course selection can be challenging for students of Liberal Arts programs.
In particular, due to the highly personalized curricula of these students,
it is often difficult to assess whether or not a particular course is too advanced given their academic background.
To assist students of the liberal arts program of the University College Maastricht,
Morsomme and Vazquez (2019) developed a course recommender system that suggests courses
whose content matches the studentâs academic interests,
and issues warnings for courses that it deems too advanced.
To issue warnings, the system produces point predictions
for the grades that a student will receive in the courses
that she/he is considering for the following term.
Point predictions are estimated with regression models specific to each course
which take into account the academic performance of the student
along with the knowledge that she/he has acquired in previous courses.
A warning is issued if the predicted grade is a fail.
In this paper, we complement the systemâs point predictions for grades
with prediction intervals constructed using the conformal prediction framework (Vovk et al., 2005).
We use the Inductive Confidence Machine (ICM) (Papadopoulos et al., 2002) with normalized nonconformity scores
to construct prediction intervals that are tailored to each student.
We find that the prediction intervals constructed with the ICM are valid
and that their widths are related to the accuracy of the underlying regression model.},

 abstract = {We investigate the use of inductive conformal prediction (ICP)
for the task of multi-label text classification
and present preliminary experimental results for a subset of the original Reuters-21578 data-set.
Our underlying classification model is a deep neural network configuration
which consists of a trainable embedding layer, a convolutional layer and two dense feed-forward layers,
arranged sequentially,
with sigmoid outputs representing the individual unique labels of the selected subset.
Following the power-set approach,
we assign nonconformity scores to label-sets
from which the corresponding p-values and prediction-sets are determined
and we experiment with a number of different versions of a nonconformity measure.
Our results indicate a good performance for the underlying model
which is carried on to the ICP without any significant accuracy loss
and with the added benefits of prediction-specific confidence information.
Prediction-sets are tight enough to be practically useful
even though the multi-label subset contains tens of thousands of possible label combinations
and empirical error-rates confirm that our outputs are well-calibrated.},

 abstract = {Conformal Prediction is a framework that produces prediction intervals based on the output from a machine learning algorithm. In this paper we explore the case when training data is made up of multiple parts available in different sources that cannot be pooled. We here consider the regression case and propose a method where a conformal predictor is trained on each data source independently, and where the prediction intervals are then combined into a single interval. We call the approach Non-Disclosed Conformal Prediction (NDCP), and we evaluate it on a regression dataset from the UCI machine learning repository using support vector regression as the underlying machine learning algorithm, with varying number of data sources and sizes. The results show that the proposed method produces conservatively valid prediction intervals, and while we cannot retain the same efficiency as when all data is used, efficiency is improved through the proposed approach as compared to predicting using a single arbitrarily chosen source.},

The challenge is to retain validity, while improving efficiency.
In this article a very generic method is proposed
which takes advantage of a well-established result in Classical Statistical Hypothesis Testing,
the NeymanâPearson Lemma, to combine CP with maximum efficiency.
The merits and the limits of the method are explored on synthetic data sets
under different levels of correlation between NonConformity Measures (NCM).
CP Combination via NeymanâPearson Lemma generally outperforms other combination methods
when an accurate and robust density ratio estimation method,
such as the V-Matrix method, is used.},

 abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts in the form of probability distributions over future events have become popular in several fields of statistical science. The dissimilarity between a probability forecast and an outcome is measured by a loss function (scoring rule). Popular example of scoring rule for continuous outcomes is the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). We consider the case where several competing methods produce online predictions in the form of probability distribution functions. In this paper, the problem of combining probabilistic forecasts is considered in the prediction with expert advice framework. We show that CRPS is a mixable loss function and then the time independent upper bound for the regret of the Vovk's aggregating algorithm using CRPS as a loss function can be obtained.
