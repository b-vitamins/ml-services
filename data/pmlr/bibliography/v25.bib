  abstract = 	 {Multivariate Gaussian densities are pervasive in pattern recognition and machine learning. A central operation that appears in most of these areas is to measure the difference between two multivariate Gaussians. Unfortunately, traditional measures based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance do not satisfy all metric axioms necessary for many algorithms. In this paper we propose a modification for the KL divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance, for multivariate Gaussian densities, that transforms the two measures into distance metrics. Next, we show how these metric axioms impact the unfolding process of manifold learning algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of the proposed metrics on two different manifold learning algorithms when used for motion clustering in video data. Our results show that, in this particular application, the new proposed metrics lead to boosts in performance (at least 7%) when compared to other divergence measures.}

Extending models and algorithms to cope with multiresolution data is a prerequisite for wide-spread exploitation of the data represented in the multiple resolutions. Mixture models are widely used probabilistic models, however, the mixture models in their standard form can be used to analyze the data represented in a single resolution. In this paper, we propose a multiresolution mixture model based on merging of the mixture components across models represented in different resolutions. Result of such an analysis scenario is to have multiple mixture models, one mixture model for each resolution of data. Our proposed solution is based on the idea on the interaction between mixture models. More specifically, we repeatedly merge component distributions of mixture models across different resolutions. We experiment our proposed algorithm on the two real-world chromosomal aberration datasets represented in two different resolutions. Results show an improvement on the compared multiresolution settings.}

This identification can be made by analyzing constraints imposed by the latents in the measurements. We introduce the concept of pairwise cluster comparison PCC to identify causal relationships from clusters and a two-stage algorithm, called LPCC, that learns a latent variable model (LVM) using PCC. First, LPCC learns the exogenous and the collider latents, as well as their observed descendants, by utilizing pairwise comparisons between clusters in the measurement space that may explain latent causes. Second, LPCC learns the non-collider endogenous latents and their children by splitting these latents from their previously learned latent ancestors. LPCC is not limited to linear or latent-tree models and does not make assumptions about the distribution. Using simulated and real-world datasets, we show that LPCC improves accuracy with the sample size, can learn large LVMs, and is accurate in learning compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.}

In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for rating prediction utilizing concepts from the field of Bayesian nonparametrics. The basic concept that underlies our approach is that each user rates a presented item based on the latent genres of the item and the latent interests of the user. Each item may belong to more than one genre, and each user may belong to more than one latent interest class. The number of existing latent genres and interests are not known beforehand, but should be inferred in a data-driven fashion. We devise a novel hierarchical factor analysis model to formulate our approach under these assumptions. We impose suitable priors over the allocation of items into genres, and users into interests; specifically, we utilize a novel scheme which comprises two coupled Indian buffet process priors that allow the number of latent classes (genres/interests) to be automatically inferred. We experiment on a large set of real ratings data, and show that our approach outperforms four common baselines, including two very competitive state-of-the-art approaches.}

This paper presents an interesting finding, namely, being able to identify neighbors with trustable labels can significantly improve the classification accuracy. Based on this finding, we propose a k-nearest-neighbor-based ranking approach to solve the multi-label classification problem. The approach exploits a ranking model to learn which neighborâs labels are more trustable candidates for a weighted KNN-based strategy, and then assigns higher weights to those candidates when making weighted-voting decisions. The weights can then be determined by using a generalized pattern search technique. We collect several real-word data sets from various domains for the experiment. Our experiment results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art instance-based learning approaches. We believe that appropriately exploiting k-nearest neighbors is useful to solve the multi-label problem.}

In this paper, we propose a novel online clustering approach based on a Dirichlet process mixture of generalized Dirichlet (GD) distributions, which can be considered as an extension of the finite GD mixture model to the infinite case. Our approach is built on nonparametric Bayesian analysis where the determination of the number of clusters is sidestepped by assuming an infinite number of mixture components. Moreover, an unsupervised localized feature selection scheme is integrated with the proposed nonparametric framework to improve the clustering performance. By learning the proposed model in an online manner using a variational approach, all the involved parameters and features saliencies are estimated simultaneously and effectively in closed forms. The proposed online infinite mixture model is validated through both synthetic data sets and two challenging real-world applications namely text document clustering and online human face detection.}

We illustrate this result on both synthetic problems and realistic problems (ad-serving and emailing campaigns optimization).}

Kernels can be easily incorporated into our method to address non-linear classification problems.

Using this representation, we present the Titar learner algorithm that can be used to extract Tita rules from large datasets expressed as Symbolic Time Sequences. The selection of temporal constraints (or time-frames) is at the core of the temporal learning. Our learning algorithm is based on two novel approaches for this problem. This first one is designed to select temporal constraints for the head of temporal association rules. The second selects temporal constraints for the body of such rules. We discuss the evaluation of probabilistic temporal association rules, evaluate our technique with two experiments, introduce a metric to evaluate sets of temporal rules, compare the results with two other approaches and discuss the results.}

To accurately predict location, a large amount of fingerprints composed of received signal strength values is necessary. Moreover, standard supervised or semi-supervised approaches also require location information to each fingerprint, where annotation work is rather tedious and time consuming. To reduce the efforts and time required to build calibration data, we present a novel calibration methodology "route-annotationâ and a self-training algorithm for learning from route information effectively. On the proposed calibration methodology, an annotator walks around while measuring fingerprints, then occasionally stops to annotate fingerprints with route from previous location to current location. This calibration reduces work time even compared to partially annotation, while routes have richer information for learning. The proposed learning algorithm comprises following two iterative steps: 1) inferring locations of each fingerprint under route constraints and 2) updating parameters. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate learning from route-annotated data is comparable to state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised approaches trained with large amount of calibration data.}

However, they cannot be used for subgraph matching since either their convex or concave relaxation becomes no longer applicable.

  abstract = 	 {Often we require classification at a very high precision level, such as 99%. We report that when very different sources of evidence such as text, audio, and video features are available, combining the outputs of base classifiers trained on each feature type separately, aka late fusion, can substantially increase the recall of the combination at high precisions, compared to the performance of a single classifier trained on all the feature types i.e.,Â early fusion, or compared to the individual base classifiers. We show how the probability of a joint false-positive mistake can be upper bounded by the product of individual probabilities of conditional false-positive mistakes, by identifying a simple key criterion that needs to hold. This provides an explanation for the high precision phenomenon, and motivates referring to such feature families as (nearly) independent. We assess the relevant factors for achieving high precision empirically, and explore combination techniques informed by the analysis. We compare a number of early and late fusion methods, and observe that classifier combination via late fusion can more than double the recall at high precision.}

Leveraging existing automata learning methods from the area of grammatical inference, we can learn generic models for network entities in the form of automata templates. As is characteristic for SRL techniques, the abstraction level afforded by learning generic templates enables one to apply the learned model to new domains. A main benefit of learning models based on finite automata lies in the fact that one can analyse the resulting models using formal model-checking techniques, which adds a dimension of model analysis not usually available for traditional SRL modeling frameworks.}

SAMF systematically induces various types of sparsity by the so-called model-induced regularization in the Bayesian framework.

The proposed model consists of latent groups of recipients, each of which is associated with a piecewise-constant Poisson rate over time. Inference of group memberships, temporal changepoints, and rate parameters is carried out via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We illustrate the utility of the model by applying it to both simulated and real-world email data sets.}

First we provide theoretical arguments concerning the transformation of an originally continuous optimization problem into one with discrete variables of low bit depth. Next we propose QBoost as an iterative training algorithm in which a subset of weak classifiers is selected by solving a hard optimization problem in each iteration. A strong classifier is incrementally constructed by concatenating the subsets of weak classifiers. We supplement the findings with experiments on one synthetic and two natural data sets and compare against the performance of existing boosting algorithms. Finally, by conducting a quantum Monte Carlo simulation we gather evidence that adiabatic quantum optimization is able to handle the discrete optimization problems generated by QBoost.}

The main idea is to extend the usual central Wishart model in traditional methods to using a likelihood depending only on pairwise distances, thus being independent of geometric assumptions about the underlying Euclidean space. This extension has two advantages: the model becomes invariant against potential bias terms in the measurements, and can be used in situations which on input use a kernel- or distance matrix, without requiring direct access to the underlying vectors. The latter aspect opens up a huge new application field for Gaussian graphical models, as network reconstruction is now possible from any Mercer kernel, be it on graphs, strings, probabilities or more complex objects. We combine this likelihood with a suitable prior to enable Bayesian network inference. We present an efficient MCMC sampler for this model and discuss the estimation of module networks. Experiments depict the high quality and usefulness of the inferred networks.}

However, in many practical applications, the estimated components are not independent. Recent variants of ICA have made use of such residual dependencies to estimate an ordering (topography) of the components. Like in ICA, the components in those variants are assumed to be uncorrelated, which might be a rather strict condition. In this paper, we address this shortcoming. We propose a generative model for the source where the components can have linear and higher order correlations, which generalizes models in use so far. Based on the model, we derive a method to estimate topographic representations. In numerical experiments on artificial data, the new method is shown to be more widely applicable than previously proposed extensions of ICA. We learn topographic representations for two kinds of real data sets: for outputs of simulated complex cells in the primary visual cortex and for text data.}

This is a top-down refinement-based class expression learning algorithm for Description Logic (DL). It is distinguished from similar DL learning algorithms in the way it uses the concepts generated by the refinement operator. In our approach, we unify the computation of concepts describing positive and negative examples, but we maintain them separately, and combine them at the end. By doing so, we can avoid the use of negation in the refinement without any loss of generality. Evaluation shows that our approach can reduce the search space significantly, and therefore the learning time is reduced. Our implementation is based on the DL-Learner framework and we inherit the Parallel Class Expression Learning (ParCEL) algorithm design for parallelisation.}

We study a multi-stage system in a prediction time cost reduction setting, where the full data is available for training, but for a test example, measurements in a new modality can be acquired at each stage for an additional cost. We seek decision rules to reduce the average measurement acquisition cost. We formulate an empirical risk minimization problem (ERM) for a multi-stage reject classifier, wherein the stage k classifier either classifies a sample using only the measurements acquired so far or rejects it to the next stage where more attributes can be acquired for a cost. To solve the ERM problem, we factorize the cost function into classification and rejection decisions. We then transform reject decisions into a binary classification problem. We construct stage-by-stage global surrogate risk, develop an iterative algorithm in the boosting framework and present convergence results. We test our work on synthetic, medical and explosives detection datasets. Our results demonstrate that substantial cost reduction without a significant sacrifice in accuracy is achievable.}

The PmSVM-LUT algorithm is based on PmSVM (Wu,Â 2012), which employed polynomial approximation for the gradient function to speedup the dual coordinate descent method. We also analyze the polynomial approximation numerically to demonstrate its validity.

To further boost PU learning performance, we extend our proposed learning method in a multi-view manner by utilizing multiple heterogeneous sources. Extensive experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, especially when positive labeled data are limited.}
