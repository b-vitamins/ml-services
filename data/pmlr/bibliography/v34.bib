  abstract = 	 {A grammatical inference algorithm tries to find as a small grammar as possible representing  a potentially infinite sequence of strings. Here, let us consider a simple restriction: the input is a finite sequence or it might be a singleton set. Then the restricted problem is called the \em grammar compression to find the smallest CFG generating just the input. In the last decade many researchers have tackled this problem because of its scalable applications, e.g., expansion of data storage capacity, speeding-up information retrieval, DNA sequencing, frequent pattern mining,  and similarity search. We would review the history of grammar compression and its wide applications together with an important future work. The study of grammar compression has begun with the bad news: the smallest CFG problem is NP-hard. Hence, the first question is: Can we get a near-optimal solution in a polynomial time?  (Is there a reasonable approximation algorithm?) And the next question is: Can we minimize the costs of time and space? (Does a linear time algorithm exist within an optimal working space?) The recent results produced by the research community answer affirmatively the questions. We introduce several important results and typical applications to a huge text collection. On the other hand, the shrinkage of the advantage of grammar compression is caused by the data explosion, since there is no working space for storing the whole data supplied from data stream. The last question is: How can we handle the stream data? For this question, we propose the framework of \em stream grammar compression for the next generation and its attractive application to fast data transmission.}

The languages of the two fields seem almost completely disjoint and incommensurable. This paper shows that this has happened, at least in part, because the recent advances in learnability have been misdescribed in two important respects. First, they have been described as resting on âempiricistâ conceptions of language, when actually, in fundamental respects that are made precise here, they are equally compatible with the ârationalistâ, ânativistâ traditions in linguistic theory. Second, the recent mathematical proposals have sometimes been presented as if they not only advance but complete the account of human language acquisition, taking the rather dramatic difference between what current mathematical models can achieve and what current linguistic theories tell us as an indication that current linguistic theories are quite generally mistaken. This paper compares the two perspectives and takes some first steps toward a unified theory, aiming to identify some common ground where ârationalistâ linguistic hypotheses  could directly address weaknesses in the current mathematical proposals.}

These classes are also promising for practical applications: in natural language analysis, because definitions have strong linguisitic support, but also in biology for modeling protein families, as suggested in our previous study introducing the class of local substitutable languages. But turning recent theoretical advances into practice badly needs truly practical algorithms. We present here an efficient learning algorithm, motivated by intelligibility and parsing efficiency of the result, which directly reduces the positive sample into a small non-redundant canonical grammar of the target substitutable language.  Thanks to this new algorithm, we have been able to extend our experimentation to a complete protein dataset confirming that it is possible to learn grammars on proteins with high specificity and good sensitivity by a generalization based on local substitutability.}

Secondly, we show how the inference problem can naturally be expressed in the framework of Structured Low-Rank Approximation.

  abstract = 	 {Counterexample analysis has emerged as one of the key challenges in Angluin-style active automata learning.  Rivest and Schapire (1993) showed for the \mathrmL^* algorithm that a single suffix of the counterexample was sufficient to ensure progress.  This suffix can be obtained in a binary search fashion, requiring Î(\log m) membership queries for a counterexample of length m. Correctly implementing this algorithm can be quite tricky, and its correctness sometimes even has been disputed. In this paper, we establish an abstract framework for counterexample analysis, which basically reduces the problem of finding a suffix to finding distinct neighboring elements in a 0/1 sequence, where the first element is 0 and the last element is 1. We demonstrate the conciseness and simplicity of our framework by using it to present new counterexample analysis algorithms, which, while maintaining the worst-case complexity of O(\log m), perform significantly better in practice. Furthermore, we contributeâin a second instantiation of our framework, highlighting its generalityâthe first sublinear counterexample analysis procedures for the algorithm due to Kearns and Vazirani (1994).}

Focusing on a tree series maximization problem, we first analyze its complexity to motivate the use of approximation techniques. We then show how a tree series can be extended to the continuous representation space, we propose an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to solve the maximization problem in this space, and we establish convergence guarantees. Finally, we provide some experiments comparing our algorithm with an implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in the space of trees.}

The data sparseness problem that occurs when inferring context-sensitive probabilities for rules is handled by the smoothing effect of hierarchical PYPs. Many possible definitions or constructions of PYP hierarchies can be used to represent the context sensitivity of derivations of CFGs in Chomsky normal form. In this study, we use a definition that is considered to be the most natural as an extension of infinite PCFGs defined in previous studies. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method called blocked Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling is known to be effective for inferring PCFGs from unsupervised sentences. Blocked MH sampling is applicable to (k,l)-context-sensitive PCFGs by modifying their so-called inside probabilities. We show that the computational cost of blocked MH sampling for (k,l)-context-sensitive PCFGs is O(|V|^l+3|s|^3) for each sentence s, where V is a set of nonterminals. This cost is too high to iterate sufficient sampling times, especially when l â 0, thus we propose an alternative sampling method that separates the sampling procedure into pointwise sampling for nonterminals and blocked sampling for rules. The computational cost of this sampling method is O(\min{|s|^l,|V|^l} (|V||s|^2+|s|^3) ). }

Formal grammatical inference aims at identifying families of languages that have a shared property, which can be used to prove efficient learnability of the families formally.  In contrast, in empirical grammatical inference research, practical systems are developed that are applied to languages.  The effectiveness of these systems is measured by comparing the learned grammar against a Gold standard which indicates the ground truth. From successful empirical learnability results, either shared properties may be identified, leading to further formal learnability results, or modifications to the systems may be made, improving practical results.  Proper evaluation of empirical systems is, therefore, essential.  Here, we evaluate and compare existing state-of-the-art context-free grammar learning systems (and novel systems based on combinations of existing phases) in a standardized evaluation environment (on a corpus of plain natural language sentences), illustrating future directions for empirical grammatical inference research.}
