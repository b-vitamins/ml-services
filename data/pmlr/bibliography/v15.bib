  abstract = 	 {While there has been considerable research in learning probabilistic graphical models from data for predictive and causal inference, almost all existing algorithms assume a single dataset of i.i.d. observations for all variables. For many applications, it may be impossible or impractical to obtain such datasets, but multiple datasets of i.i.d. observations for different subsets of these variables may be available. Tillman et al. (2009) showed how directed graphical models learned from such datasets can be integrated to construct an equivalence class of structures over all variables. While their procedure is correct, it assumes that the structures integrated do not entail contradictory conditional independences and dependences for variables in their intersections. While this assumption is reasonable asymptotically, it rarely holds in practice with finite samples due to the frequency of statistical errors. We propose a new correct procedure for learning such equivalence classes directly from the multiple datasets which avoids this problem and is thus more practically useful. Empirical results indicate our method is not only more accurate, but also faster and requires less memory.}

  abstract = 	 {We address the problem of competing with any large set of $N$ policies in the non-stochastic bandit setting, where the learner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions but observes only the reward of the chosen action. We present a modification of the Exp4 algorithm of Auer et al., called Exp4.P, which with high probability incurs regret at most $O(\sqrt{KT\ln N})$.  Such a bound does not hold for Exp4 due to the large variance of the importance-weighted estimates used in the algorithm. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset.  For the stochastic version of the problem, we can use Exp4.P as a subroutine to compete with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension d while incurring regret at most $O(\sqrt{Td\ln T})$ with high probability.  These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing guarantees for this setting that are comparable to those in standard supervised learning.}

This model is inspired by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been shown to be a powerful model of such distributions. However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this difficulty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM.  }

However, often we would like to include more structural information than mere sparsity. In this work, we focus on learning so-called âscale-freeâ models,  a common feature that appears in many real-work networks. We replace the $\ell_1$ regularization with a power law regularization and  optimize the objective function by a sequence of iteratively reweighted $\ell_1$ regularization problems, where the regularization coefficients of nodes with high degree are reduced, encouraging the appearance of hubs with high degree. Our method can be easily adapted to improve any existing $\ell_1$-based methods, such as graphical lasso, neighborhood selection, and JSRM when the underlying networks are believed to be scale free or have dominating hubs. We demonstrate in simulation that our method significantly outperforms the a baseline $\ell_1$ method at learning scale-free networks and hub networks, and also illustrate its behavior on gene expression data.}

We develop new algorithms that directly maximize the likelihood and show that these new algorithms are competitive with the leading spectral approaches on a robot navigation visualization and a human motion capture data set.  }

One of the fastest algorithms for NMF is the Block Principal Pivoting method (BPP) of (Kim & Park, 2008b), which follows a block coordinate descent approach. The optimization in each iteration involves solving a large number of expensive least squares problems. Taking the view that the design matrix was generated by a stochastic process, and using the asymptotic normality of the least squares estimator, we propose a method for improving the performance of BPP. Our method starts with a small subset of the columns and rows of the original matrix and uses frequentist hypothesis tests to adaptively increase the size of the problem. This achieves two objectives: 1) during the initial phase of the algorithm we solve far fewer, much smaller sized least squares problems and 2) all hypothesis tests failing while using all the data represents a principled, automatic stopping criterion. Our experiments on three real world datasets show that our algorithm significantly improves the performance of the original BPP algorithm.}

(2008b), our method starts by solving the first-order LOCAL(G) linear programming relaxation. This is followed by an adaptive tightening of the relaxation where we incrementally add higher-order interactions to enforce proper marginalization over groups of variables. Computing the best interaction to add is an NP-hard problem. We show good solutions to this problem can be readily obtained from âlocal primal-dual gapsâ given the current primal solution and a dual reparameterization vector. This is not only extremely efficient, but in contrast to previous approaches, also allows us to search over prohibitively large sets of candidate interactions to add. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach on MAP-MRF inference problems encountered in computer vision.}

In this setting, the key intuition is that that if we can link target-specific features to source features, we can learn effectively using only source labeled data. We formalize this intuition, as well as the assumptions under which such coupled learning is possible. This allows us to give finite sample target error bounds (using only source training data) and an algorithm which performs at the state-of-the-art on two natural language processing adaptation tasks which are characterized by novel target features.}

Most of the past work on IRL requires that a (near)-optimal policy can be computed for different reward functions. However, this requirement can hardly be satisfied in systems with a large, or continuous, state space. In this paper, we propose a model-free IRL algorithm, where the relative entropy between the empirical distribution of the state-action trajectories under a baseline policy and their distribution under the learned policy is minimized by stochastic gradient descent. We compare this new approach to well-known IRL algorithms using learned MDP models. Empirical results on simulated car racing, gridworld and ball-in-a-cup problems show that our approach is able to learn good policies from a small number of demonstrations.}

This gives a strong motivation to develop efficient methods for  KL minimisation.

This observation, along with compact concave parametrisations of the covariance, enables us to develop fast scalable optimisation procedures to obtain lower bounds on the marginal likelihood in large scale Bayesian linear models.}

In this paper, however, we show that several simple factors, such as the number of hidden nodes in the model, may be more important to achieving high performance than the learning algorithm or the depth of the model. Specifically, we will apply several off-the-shelf feature learning algorithms (sparse auto-encoders, sparse RBMs, K-means clustering, and Gaussian mixtures) to CIFAR-10, NORB, and STL datasets using only single-layer networks. We then present a detailed analysis of the effect of changes in the model setup: the receptive field size, number of hidden nodes (features), the step-size (âstrideâ) between extracted features, and the effect of whitening. Our results show that large numbers of hidden nodes and dense feature extraction are critical to achieving high performance - so critical, in fact, that when these parameters are pushed to their limits, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on both CIFAR-10 and NORB using only a single layer of features. More surprisingly, our best performance is based on K-means clustering, which is extremely fast, has no hyper-parameters to tune beyond the model structure itself, and is very easy to implement. Despite the simplicity of our system, we achieve accuracy beyond all previously published results on the CIFAR-10 and NORB datasets (79.6% and 97.2% respectively).}

We refer to the new resulting mechanism as the hopeful mechanism (HM) since although it is incentive compatible, buyers can deviate with extreme consequences for the seller at very little cost to themselves. For real-world settings we propose a robust version of the  approach which takes the form of a Markov decision process where the actions are functions.

First, we show that, if the intracluster similarities exceed intercluster similarities, then it is possible to correctly determine the hierarchical clustering from as few as $3N \log N$ similarities. We demonstrate this order of magnitude saving in the number of pairwise similarities necessitates sequentially selecting which similarities to obtain in an adaptive fashion, rather than picking them at random. Finally, we propose an active clustering method that is robust to a limited fraction of anomalous similarities, and show how even in the presence of these noisy similarity values we can resolve the hierarchical clustering using only $O(N \log^2 N)$ pairwise similarities.}

The Group Lasso formulation, widely used as a good heuristic, arises naturally from the Lagrangian relaxation of our formulation.  Second, we present an efficient combinatorial algorithm for provable sparse recovery under similar assumptions on KB-RIP. As a side product, this result improves the previous best assumptions on RIP under which a combinatorial algorithm was known. Finally, we provide numerical evidence to illustrate that not only are our sum-of-norms-minimization formulation and combinatorial algorithm significantly faster than Lasso, they also outperforms Lasso in terms of recovery.}

Even though they can take advantage of semi-supervised setups with extra-unlabeled data, deep rectifier networks can reach their best performance without requiring any unsupervised pre-training on purely supervised tasks with large labeled datasets.

Recent work in parallel Gibbs sampling has focused on update schedules which do not guarantee convergence to the intended stationary distribution.  In this work, we propose two methods to construct parallel Gibbs samplers guaranteed to draw from the targeted distribution. The first method, called the Chromatic sampler, uses graph coloring to construct a direct parallelization of the classic sequential scan Gibbs sampler.  In the case of 2-colorable models we relate the Chromatic sampler to the Synchronous Gibbs sampler (which draws all variables simultaneously in parallel), and reveal new ergodic properties of Synchronous Gibbs chains.  Our second method, the Splash sampler, is a complementary strategy which can be used when the variables are tightly coupled. This constructs and samples multiple blocks in parallel, using a novel locking protocol and an iterative junction tree generation algorithm.  We further improve the Splash sampler through adaptive tree construction.  We demonstrate the benefits of our two sampling algorithms on large synthetic and real-world models using a 32 processor multi-core system.}

We present an optimal market-based algorithm, derived from a mixed integer program formulation of planning problems.  Our method is based on two well-known techniques for optimization: Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and Gomory cuts. The former prices resources optimally for a relaxed version of the problem, while the latter introduces new derivative resources to correct pricing imbalances that arise from the relaxation. Our algorithm is applicable to a wide variety of multi-agent planning domains.  We provide optimality guarantees and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in both centralized and distributed settings on synthetic planning problems.}

The space improvement is most significant in cases where edge weights are determined by a function of node descriptors, such as a distance or kernel function. In practice, we demonstrate maximum weight $b$-matchings to be solvable on graphs with hundreds of millions of edges in only a few hours of compute time on a modern personal computer without parallelization, whereas neither the memory nor the time requirement of previously known algorithms would have allowed graphs of this scale.}

The second bound is a Rademacher complexity bound which is additive in the (logarithmic) kernel complexity and margin term. This dependency is superior to all previously published Rademacher bounds for learning a convex combination of kernels, including the recent bound of Cortes et al. (2010), which exhibits a multiplicative interaction. We illustrate the tightness of our bounds with simulations.}

We provide a quantitative consistency analysis of a procedure based on node-wise multi-class logistic regression with group-sparse regularization.  We first consider general $m$-ary pairwise models â where each factor depends on at most two variables. We show that when the number of samples scale as $n > K(m-1)^2 d^2 \log ((m-1)^2(p-1))$ â where $d$ is the maximum degree and $K$ a fixed constant â the procedure succeeds in recovering the graph with high probability. For general models with $c$-way factors, the natural multi-way extension of the pairwise method quickly becomes very computationally complex. So we studied the effectiveness of using the pairwise method even while the true model has higher order factors. Surprisingly, we show that under slightly more stringent conditions, the pairwise procedure still recovers the graph structure,  when the samples scale as $n > K (m-1)^2 d^{\frac{3}{2}c - 1} \log ( (m-1)^c (p-1)^{c-1} )$.}

This gave rise to   a natural approach to building objectives with sparse optima  whereby such convex penalties are added to another objective.   Such a heuristic approach to objective building does not always work. For example, addition of an $L_1$ penalty to the KL-divergence fails to induce any sparsity, as the $L_1$ norm of any vector in a simplex is a constant.   However, a convex envelope of KL and a cardinality penalty can be obtained that indeed trades off sparsity and KL-divergence.    We consider cases of two composite penalties, elastic net and fused lasso, which combine multiple desiderata.   In both of these cases, we show that a hard objective relaxed to obtain penalties can be more tightly approximated.   Further, by construction, it is impossible to get a better convex approximation than the ones we derive.     Thus, constructing a joint envelope across different parts of the objective   provides means to trade off tightness and computational cost.}

We present a novel approach to cross-clustering, based on approximating the solution to a Cross Dirichlet Process mixture (CDPM) model [Shafto et al., 2006, Mansinghka et al., 2009]. Our bottom-up, deterministic approach results in a hierarchical clustering of dimensions, and at each node, a hierarchical clustering of data points. We also present a randomized approximation, based on a truncated hierarchy, that scales linearly in the number of levels. Results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate that the cross-clustering based algorithms perform as well or better than the clustering based algorithms, our deterministic approaches models perform as well as the MCMC-based CDPM, and the randomized approximation provides a remarkable speedup relative to the full deterministic approximation with minimal cost in predictive error.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider a matching pursuit approach for variable selection and estimation in logistic regression models. Specifically, we propose Logistic Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (Logit-GOMP), which extends the Group-OMP procedure originally proposed for linear regression models, to select groups of variables in logistic regression models, given a predefined grouping structure within the explanatory variables. We theoretically characterize the performance of Logit-GOMP in terms of predictive accuracy, and also provide conditions under which Logit-GOMP is able to identify the correct (groups of) variables. Our results are non-asymptotic in contrast to classical consistency results for logistic regression which only apply in the asymptotic limit where the dimensionality is fixed or is restricted to grow slowly with the sample size. We conduct empirical evaluation on simulated data sets and the real world problem of splice site detection in DNA sequences.  The results indicate that Logit-GOMP compares favorably to Logistic Group Lasso both in terms of variable selection and prediction accuracy. We also provide a generic version of our algorithm that applies to the wider class of generalized linear models.}

In this paper, we consider the recovery of jointly sparse signals in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) scenario where signal is represented as a matrix and the sparsity of signal occurs in a common location set. The sparse MMV model can be formulated as a matrix $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem. However, the $(2,1)$-norm minimization problem is much more difficult to solve than l1-norm minimization. In this paper, we propose a very fast algorithm, called MMV-ADM, for jointly sparse signal recovery in MMV settings based on the alternating direction method (ADM). The MMV-ADM alternately updates the signal matrix, the Lagrangian multiplier and the residue, and all update rules only involve matrix or vector multiplications and summations, so it is simple, easy to implement and much more fast than the state-of-the-art method MMVprox. Numerical simulations show that MMV-ADM is at least dozens of times faster than MMVprox with comparable recovery accuracy.}

Since these features are learned for regenerating training data a classifier based on them has to be trained. If only a few of the learned features are discriminative other non-discriminative features will distract the classifier during the training process and thus waste computing resources for testing. In this paper, we present a hybrid third-order Restricted Boltzmann Machine in which class-relevant features (for recognizing) and class-irrelevant features (for generating only) are learned simultaneously. As the classification task uses only the class-relevant features, the test itself becomes very fast. We show that class-irrelevant features help class-relevant features to focus on the recognition task and introduce useful regularization effects to reduce the norms of class-relevant features. Thus there is no need to use weight-decay for the parameters of this model. Experiments on the MNIST, NORB and Caltech101 Silhouettes datasets show very promising results.}

Learning the CAKE estimator given a training set reduces to solving a single convex quadratic programming problem. We derive rates of convergence of CAKE like estimator to the true underlying density under smoothness assumptions on the class and show that given a sufficiently large sample the mean squared error of such estimators is optimal in a minimax sense. We also give a risk bound of the CAKE estimator in terms of its empirical risk.

In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles $L_1$ regularization explicitly, it has been observed that the FTRL-style Regularized Dual Averaging (RDA) algorithm is even more effective at producing sparsity.  Our results demonstrate that the key difference between these algorithms is how they handle the cumulative $L_1$ penalty. While FOBOS handles the $L_1$ term exactly on any given update, we show that it is effectively using subgradient approximations to the $L_1$ penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form.  The FTRL-Proximal algorithm, which we introduce, can be seen as a hybrid of these two algorithms, and significantly outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.}

The significance of these results crucially hinges upon the possibility of efficiently and accurately testing this coherence assumption. This paper precisely addresses this issue. We introduce a novel sampling-based algorithm for estimating coherence, present associated estimation guarantees and report the results of extensive experiments for coherence estimation.  The quality of the estimation guarantees we present depends on the coherence value to estimate itself, but this turns out to be an inherent property of sampling-based coherence estimation, as shown by our lower bound. In practice, however, we find that these theoretically unfavorable scenarios rarely appear, as our algorithm efficiently and accurately estimates coherence across a wide range of datasets, and these estimates are excellent predictors of the effectiveness of sampling-based matrix approximation on a case-by-case basis. These results are significant as they reveal the extent to which coherence assumptions made in a number of recent machine learning publications are testable.}

We design a new model called TopicFlow, which combines ideas from network flow and topic modeling, to learn this notion of topic specific influences of hyperlinked documents in a completely unsupervised fashion. On the task of citation recommendation, which is an instance of capturing influence, the TopicFlow model, when combined with TF-IDF based cosine similarity, outperforms several competitive baselines by as much as 11.8%. Our empirical study of the model's output on ACL corpus demonstrates its ability to identify topically influential documents. The Topic- Flow model is also competitive with the state-of-theart Relational Topic Models in predicting the likelihood of unseen text on two different data sets. Due to its ability to learn topic-specific flows across each hyperlink, the TopicFlow model can be a powerful visualization tool to track the diffusion of topics across a citation network.}

As a result, we acquire the ability to define continuous distributions over a hypersphere with all the benefits of directional statistics.  We provide polynomial time projections between the continuous hypersphere representation and the $n!$-element permutation space.  The framework provides a way to use continuous directional probability densities and the methods developed thereof for establishing densities over permutations.  As a demonstration of the benefits of the framework we derive an inference procedure for a state-space model over permutations.  We demonstrate the approach with applications and comparisons to existing models.}

We characterize NDCG consistent surrogates to discover a surprising fact: several commonly used surrogates are NDCG inconsistent. We then show how to change them so that they become NDCG consistent in a strong but natural sense. An explicit characterization of strong NDCG consistency is provided. Going beyond qualitative consistency considerations, we also give quantitive statements that enable us to transform the excess error, as measured in the surrogate, to the excess error in comparison to the Bayes optimal ranking function for NDCG. Finally, we also derive improved results if a certain natural âlow noiseâ or âlarge marginâ condition holds. Our experiments demonstrate that ensuring NDCG consistency does improve the performance of listwise ranking methods on real-world datasets. Moreover, a novel surrogate function suggested by our theoretical results leads to further improvements over NDCG consistent versions of existing surrogates.}

In this paper, we propose a new iterative algorithm, which trains a stationary deterministic policy, that can be seen as a no regret algorithm in an online learning setting. We show that any such no regret algorithm, combined with additional reduction assumptions, must find a policy with good performance under the distribution of observations it induces in such sequential settings. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms previous approaches on two challenging imitation learning problems and a benchmark sequence labeling problem.}

Then we establish conditions under which ergodicity of the observations implies ergodicity of the joint sequence of observations and labels. This result is the key ingredient to derive conditions for strong consistency of the MLEs. Interesting findings are that the consistency crucially depends on the limit behavior of the Hessian of the likelihood function and that, asymptotically, the state feature functions do not matter.}

Thus, to handle cases with heterogeneous input, in this paper we present a newly developed model using heterogeneous auxiliary tasks to help main task learning. First, we formulate a convex optimization problem for the proposed model, and then, we analyze its hypothesis class and derive true risk bounds. Finally, we compare the proposed model with other relevant methods when applied to the problem of skin cancer screening and public datasets. Our results show that the performance of the proposed method is highly competitive compared to other relevant methods.}

Our model retains the ability of nonparametric methods to learn the number of clusters from data. At the same time it addresses two key limitations of nonparametric Bayesian methods: modeling data that are not exchangeable and have many correlated features. Spectral methods use the similarity between documents to map them into a low-dimensional spectral space where we then compare several clustering methods.  Our experiments on handwritten digits and text documents show that nonparametric methods such as the CRP or dd-CRP can perform as well as or better than $k$-means and also recover the true number of clusters.  We improve the performance of the dd-CRP in spectral space by incorporating the original similarity matrix in its prior.  This simple modification results in better performance than all other methods we compared to. We offer a new formulation and first experimental evaluation of a general Gibbs sampler for  mixture modeling with distance-dependent CRPs.}

Messages are represented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and message updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS.  KBP makes none of the assumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need not arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their relations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined ($\mathbb{R}^d$, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not exist.  The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In experiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still images, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing classical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases), while providing significantly more accurate results.}

We show that under suitable sparsity assumptions, this strategy achieves the generalization error performance of a boosted classifier trained on the entire data set while only selecting logarithmically many unlabeled samples to label. We also establish a partial negative result, in that with out imposing structural assumptions it is difficult to guarantee generalization error performance. We explicitly characterize our convergence rate in terms of the sign pattern differences produced by the weak learners on the unlabeled data. We also present a convex relaxation to account for the non-convex sparse structure and show that the computational complexity of the resulting algorithm scales polynomially in the number of weak learners. We test ActBoost on several datasets to illustrate its performance and demonstrate its robustness to initialization.}

It has been applied widely in probabilistic topic modeling, where the data are documents and the components are distributions of terms that reflect recurring patterns (or âtopicsâ) in the collection.  Given a document collection, posterior inference is used to determine the number of topics needed and to characterize their distributions.  One limitation of HDP analysis is that existing posterior inference algorithms require multiple passes through all the dataâthese algorithms are intractable for very large scale applications.  We propose an online variational inference algorithm for the HDP, an algorithm that is easily applicable to massive and streaming data.  Our algorithm is significantly faster than traditional inference algorithms for the HDP, and lets us analyze much larger data sets.  We illustrate the approach on two large collections of text, showing improved performance over online LDA, the finite counterpart to the HDP topic model.}

We show how the solution of the SDP problem can be further improved with a low-rank refinement heuristic. The low-rank solution reveals  more clearly the cluster structure of the data.  Empirical studies on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In particular, the approach outperforms several other clustering algorithms when compared on standard evaluation metrics.}

Random choices in the program are ânamedâ with information about their position in an execution trace; these names are used in conjunction with a database of randomness to implement MCMC inference in the space of execution traces.  We encode naming information using lightweight source-to-source compilers.

  abstract = 	 {Theoretical analysis of structured learning methods has focused primarily on domains where the data consist of independent (albeit structured) examples. Although the statistical relational learning (SRL) community has recently developed many classification methods for graph and network domains, much of this work has focused on modeling domains where there is a single network for learning. For example, we could learn a model to predict the political views of users in an online social network, based on the friendship relationships among users. In this example, the data would be drawn from a single large network (e.g., Facebook) and increasing the data size would correspond to acquiring a larger graph. Although SRL methods can successfully improve classification in these types of domains, there has been little theoretical analysis of addressing the issue of single network domains. In particular, the asymptotic properties of estimation are not clear if the size of the model grows with the size of the network. In this work, we focus on outlining the conditions under which learning from a single network will be asymptotically consistent and normal. Moreover, we compare the properties of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with that of generalized maximum pseudolikelihood estimation (MPLE) and use the resulting understanding to propose novel MPLE estimators for single network domains. We include empirical analysis on both synthetic and real network data to illustrate the findings.}

Our method uses a look-ahead sampler, which uses bounds to attempt to sample variables before the results  of other threads are made available.  We demonstrate our algorithm on Gibbs sampling in Boltzmann machines and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).

Photo album summarization is a typical application of CDOM, where photos are automatically aligned into a designed frame expressed in the Cartesian coordinate system. CDOM is usually formulated as finding a mapping from objects in one domain (photos) to objects in the other domain (frame) so that the pairwise dependency is maximized. A state-of-the-art CDOM method employs a kernel-based dependency measure, but it has a drawback that the kernel parameter needs to be determined manually. In this paper, we propose alternative CDOM methods that can naturally address the model selection problem.  Through experiments on image matching, unpaired voice conversion, and photo album summarization tasks, the effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated.}

Although commonly understood as a method of finding the maximum-margin hyperplane, it can also be formulated as a regularized function estimation problem, corresponding to a hinge loss function plus an $\ell_2$-norm regulation term. The doubly regularized support vector machine (DrSVM) is a variant of the standard SVM, which introduces an additional $\ell_1$-norm regularization term on the fitted coefficients. The combined $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ regularization, termed elastic net penalty, has the interesting property of achieving simultaneous variable selection and margin-maximization within a single framework. However, because of the nonsmoothness of both the loss function and the regularization term, there is no efficient method to solve DrSVM for large scale problems. Here we develop an efficient algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve the optimization problem in DrSVM. The utility of the method is further illustrated using both simulated and real-world datasets.}

PLS-DN exhibits provable semi-iterative property, i.e., the algorithm converges globally to the exact solution in a finite number of iterations. The rate of convergence is shown to be at least linear before termination. We emphasize the applications of our method to modeling, from a novel perspective of PLS, several statistical learning problems such as elitist Lasso, non-negative least squares and support vector machines.

By applying the obtained deviation inequalities, we then show the generalization bound for ID empirical process based on the annealed Vapnik- Chervonenkis (VC) entropy. Afterward, according to Sauer's lemma, we get the generalization bound for ID empirical process based on the VC dimension. Finally, by using a resulted result bound, we analyze the asymptotic convergence of ID empirical process and show that the convergence rate of ID empirical process can reach $O\left(\left(\frac{\Lambda_\mathcal{F}(2N)}{N}\right)^\frac{1}{1.3}\right)$ and it is faster than the results of the generic i.i.d. empirical process (Vapnik, 1999).}

Although it seems natural to use ECOCs for multi-label problems as well, doing so naively creates issues related to: the validity of the encoding, the efficiency of the decoding, the predictability of the generated codeword, and the exploitation of the label dependency.  Using canonical correlation analysis, we propose an error-correcting code for multi-label classification. Label dependency is characterized as the most predictable directions in the label space, which are extracted as canonical output variates and encoded into the codeword. Predictions for the codeword define a graphical model of labels with both Bernoulli potentials (from classifiers on the labels) and Gaussian potentials (from regression on the canonical output variates). Decoding is performed by efficient mean-field approximation.  We establish connections between the proposed code and research areas such as compressed sensing and ensemble learning. Some of these connections contribute to better understanding of the new code, and others lead to practical improvements in code design.  In our empirical study, the proposed code leads to substantial improvements compared to various competitors in music emotion classification and outdoor scene recognition.}

Coupling the dHBP with the Bernoulli process, and upon marginalizing out the dHBP, the model may be interpreted as a covariate-dependent hierarchical Indian buffet process. As applications, we consider interpolation and denoising of an image, with covariates defined by the location of image patches within an image. Two types of noise models are considered: (i) typical white Gaussian noise; and (ii) spiky noise of arbitrary amplitude, distributed uniformly at random. In these examples, the features correspond to the atoms of a dictionary, learned based upon the data under test (without a priori training data). State-of-the-art performance is demonstrated, with efficient inference using hybrid Gibbs, Metropolis-Hastings and slice sampling.}
