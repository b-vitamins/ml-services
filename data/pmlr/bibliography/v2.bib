  abstract = 	 {In uncertain and partially observable environments control policies must be a function of the complete history of actions and observations. Rather than present an ever growing history to a learner, we instead track sufficient statistics of the history and map those to a control policy. The mapping has typically been done using dynamic programming, requiring large amounts of memory. We present a general approach to mapping sufficient statistics directly to control policies by combining the tracking of sufficient statistics with the use of policy-gradient reinforcement learning. The best known sufficient statistic is the belief state, computed from a known or estimated partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model. More recently, predictive state representations (PSRs) have emerged as a potentially compact model of partially observable systems. Our experiments explore the usefulness of both of these sufficient statistics, exact and estimated, in direct policy-search.}

Unlike the original problem, these order relations can be contradictory and need not be specified for all pairs of dissimilarities. We argue that this setting is more natural in some experimental settings and propose an algorithm based on convex optimization techniques to solve this problem. We apply this algorithm to human subject data from a psychophysics experiment concerning how reflectance properties are perceived.

It can capture topic correlations via the use of a logistic-normal distribution to model non-trivial variabilities in the topic mixing vectors underlying documents. However, the non-conjugacy caused by the logistic-normal makes posterior inference and model learning significantly more challenging. In this paper, we present a new, tight approximate inference algorithm for LoNTAM based on a multivariate quadratic Taylor approximation scheme that facilitates elegant closed-form message passing. We present experimental results on simulated data as well as on the NIPS17 and PNAS document collections, and show that our approach is not only simple and easy to implement, but also it converges faster, and leads to more accurate recovery of the semantic truth underlying documents and estimates of the parameters comparing to previous methods.}

Spectral clustering techniques generate embeddings that constitute an example of directional data and can result in different shapes on a hypersphere (depending on the original structure). Other examples of directional data include text and some sub-domains of bioinformatics. The Watson distribution for directional data presents a tractable form and has more modeling capability than the simple von Mises-Fisher distribution. In this paper, we present a generative model of mixtures of Watson distributions on a hypersphere and derive numerical approximations of the parameters in an Expectation Maximization (EM) setting. This model also allows us to present an explanation for choosing the right embedding dimension for spectral clustering. We analyze the algorithm on a generated example and demonstrate its superiority over the existing algorithms through results on real datasets.}

We draw from Extreme Value Theory the tools to build a hybrid unimodal density having a parameter controlling the heaviness of the upper tail. This hybrid is a Gaussian whose upper tail has been replaced by a generalized Pareto tail. We use this hybrid in a multi-modal mixture in order to obtain a nonparametric density estimator that can easily adapt for heavy tailed data. To obtain a conditional density estimator, the parameters of the mixture estimator can be seen as functions of X and these functions learned. We show experimentally that this approach better models the conditional density in terms of likelihood than compared competing algorithms : conditional mixture models with other types of components and multivariate nonparametric models.}

When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large data sets.}

A priority-driven search algorithm is guaranteed to return the optimal answer if the priority function is an underestimate of the true cost function. We introduce the notion of a probable approximate underestimate, and show that it can be used to compute a probable approximate solution to the inference problem when used as a priority function. We show that we can learn probable approximate underestimate functions which have the functional form of simpler, easy to decode models. These models can be learned from unlabeled data by solving a linear/quadratic optimization problem. As a result, we get a priority function that can be computed quickly, and results in solutions that are (provably) almost optimal most of the time. Using these ideas, discriminative classifiers such as semi-Markov CRFs and discriminative parsers can be sped up using a generalization of the A* algorithm. Further, this technique resolves one of the biggest obstacles to the use of A* as a general decoding procedure, namely that of coming up with a admissible priority function. Applying this technique results in a algorithm that is more than 3 times as fast as the Viterbi algorithm for decoding semi-Markov Conditional Markov Models.}

These simple heuristics are traditionally composed into a new admissible heuristic by selecting the highest scoring elementary heuristic in each distance evaluation. We suggest that learning a weighted sum over the elementary heuristics can often generate a heuristic with higher dominance than the heuristic defined by the highest score selection. The weights within our composite heuristic are trained in an online manner using nodes to which the true distance has already been revealed during previous search stages. Several experiments demonstrate that the proposed method typically finds the optimal path while significantly reducing the search complexity. Our theoretical analysis describes conditions under which finding the shortest path can be guaranteed.}

Subject to this constraint, our method selects the mapping in which the variance of the embedded points is maximized. This has the effect of favoring embeddings with low effective dimensionality. The related optimization problem can be cast as a convex Semidefinite Program (SDP). We also present a parametric version of the problem, which can be used for embedding out of sample points. The parametric version uses kernels to obtain nonlinear maps, and can also be solved using an SDP.

  abstract = 	 {Sampling from belief networks which have a substantial number of zero probabilities is problematic. MCMC algorithms like Gibbs sampling do not converge and importance sampling schemes generate many zero weight samples that are rejected, yielding an inefficient sampling process (the rejection problem). In this paper, we propose to augment importance sampling with systematic constraint-satisfaction search in order to overcome the rejection problem. The resulting SampleSearch scheme can be made unbiased by using a computationally expensive weighting scheme. To overcome this an approximation is proposed such that the resulting estimator is asymptotically unbiased. Our empirical results demonstrate the potential of our new scheme.}

These algorithms assume each word in the document was generated by a hidden topic and explicitly model the word distribution of each topic as well as the prior distribution over topics in the document. Given these parameters, the topics of all words in the same document are assumed to be independent. In this paper, we propose modeling the topics of words in the document as a Markov chain. Specifically, we assume that all words in the same sentence have the same topic, and successive sentences are more likely to have the same topics. Since the topics are hidden, this leads to using the well-known tools of Hidden Markov Models for learning and inference. We show that incorporating this dependency allows us to learn better topics and to disambiguate words that can belong to different topics. Quantitatively, we show that we obtain better perplexity in modeling documents with only a modest increase in learning and inference complexity.}

This is the case in problems where data points actually simultaneously belong to multiple, overlapping clusters. For example a particular gene may have several functions, therefore belonging to several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist may want to discover these through unsupervised modeling of gene expression data. We present a new nonparametric Bayesian method, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), for modeling overlapping clusters. The IOMM uses exponential family distributions to model each cluster and forms an overlapping mixture by taking products of such distributions, much like products of experts (Hinton, 2002). The IOMM allows an unbounded number of clusters, and assignments of points to (multiple) clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet Process (IBP), (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM has the desirable properties of being able to focus in on overlapping regions while maintaining the ability to model a potentially infinite number of clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC inference algorithms for the IOMM and show that these can be used to cluster movies into multiple genres.}

We seek the maximum entropy relaxation (MER) within an exponential family, which maximizes entropy subject to constraints that marginal distributions on small subsets of variables are close to the prescribed marginals in relative entropy. To solve MER, we present a modified primal-dual interior point method that exploits sparsity of the Fisher information matrix in models defined on chordal graphs. This leads to a tractable, scalable approach provided the level of relaxation in MER is sufficient to obtain a thin graph. The merits of our approach are investigated by recovering the structure of some simple graphical models from sample data.}

We show how this framework can be applied for learning generic, irregular (variable-width bin) histograms, and how to compute the NML model selection criterion efficiently.

For instance, in an image recognition task, where the features are pixels, the meta-features can be the (x, y) position of each pixel. We propose a new learning framework that incorporates meta- features.  In this framework we assume that a weight is assigned to each feature, as in linear discrimination, and we use the meta-features to define a prior on the weights. This prior is based on a Gaussian process and the weights are assumed to be a smooth function of the meta-features. Using this framework we derive a practical algorithm that improves gen- eralization by using meta-features and discuss the theoretical advantages of incorporating them into the learning. We apply our framework to design a new kernel for hand-written digit recognition. We obtain higher accuracy with lower computational complexity in the primal representation. Finally, we discuss the applicability of this framework to biological neural networks.}

In particular, we show that problems such as the k-means clustering and maximum variance unfolding (MVU) may be expressed exactly as low-rank SDPs and solved using our approach. We demonstrate that in the above problems our approach is significantly faster, far more scalable and often produces better results compared to traditional SDP relaxation techniques.}

Despite the high dimensionality, the data is typically redundant with underlying structures that can be represented by only a few features. In such settings and specifically when the number of variables is much larger than the sample size, standard global methods may not perform well for common learning tasks such as classification, regression and clustering. In this paper, we present treelets â a new tool for multi-resolution analysis that extends wavelets on smooth signals to general unstructured data sets. By construction, treelets provide an orthogonal basis that reflects the internal structure of the data. In addition, treelets can be useful for feature selection and dimensionality reduction prior to learning. We give a theoretical analysis of our algorithm for a linear mixture model, and present a variety of situations where treelets outperform classical principal component analysis, as well as variable selection schemes such as supervised (sparse) PCA.}

Here we present an efficient algorithm for choosing the optimal (most informative) query when the output labels are related to the inputs by a generalized linear model (GLM). The algorithm is based on a Laplace approximation of the posterior distribution of the GLM's parameters. The algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a single two-dimensional search to choose the optimal query and has complexity $O(n^2)$ (with $n$ the dimension of the feature space), making active learning with GLMs feasible even for high-dimensional feature spaces. In certain cases the twodimensional search may be reduced to a onedimensional search, further improving the algorithm's efficiency. Simulation results show that the model parameters can be estimated much more efficiently using the active learning technique than by using randomly chosen queries. We compute the asymptotic posterior covariance semi-analytically and demonstrate that the algorithm empirically achieves this asymptotic convergence rate, which is generally better than the convergence rate in the random-query setting. Finally, we generalize the approach to efficiently handle both output history effects (for applications to time-series models of autoregressive type) and slow, non-systematic drifts in the model parameters}

Using a modification of a recently developed nonparametric regression framework called rodeo (regularization of derivative expectation operator), we propose a method to greedily select bandwidths in a kernel density estimate. It is shown empirically that the density rodeo works well even for very high dimensional problems. When the unknown density function satisfies a suitably defined sparsity condition, and the parametric baseline density is smooth, the approach is shown to achieve near optimal minimax rates of convergence, and thus avoids the curse of dimensionality.}

  abstract = 	 {We consider the semi-supervised clustering problem where we know (with varying degree of certainty) that some sample pairs are (or are not) in the same class. Unlike previous efforts in adapting clustering algorithms to incorporate those pairwise relations, our work is based on a discriminative model. We generalize the standard Gaussian process classifier (GPC) to express our classification preference. To use the samples not involved in pairwise relations, we employ the graph kernels (covariance matrix) based on the entire data set. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that our algorithm significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.}

The method is exact if the graphical model contains a single loop. The complexity of the method is exponential in the size of the Markov blankets. The results are very accurate in general: the error is often several orders of magnitude smaller than that of standard BP, as illustrated by numerical experiments.}

Given a weighted graph, we focus on the rules of weighted neighbors to predict the label of a particular node. A maximum margin and maximal average margin based argument is used to prove a generalization bound, and is subsequently related to the classical MINCUT approach. From a practical perspective a simple and intuitive, but efficient convex formulation is constructed. This scheme can readily be implemented as a linear program which scales well till a few thousands of (labeled or unlabeled) data-points. The extremal case is studied where one observes only a single label, and this setting is related to the task of unsupervised clustering.}

In this framework, an energy function associates low energies to input points that are similar to training samples, and high energies to unobserved points. Learning consists in minimizing the energies of training samples while ensuring that the energies of unobserved ones are higher. Some traditional methods construct the architecture so that only a small number of points can have low energy, while other methods explicitly âpull upâ on the energies of unobserved points. In probabilistic methods the energy of unobserved points is pulled by minimizing the log partition function, an expensive, and sometimes intractable process. We explore different and more efficient methods using an energy-based approach. In particular, we show that a simple solution is to restrict the amount of information contained in codes that represent the data. We demonstrate such a method by training it on natural image patches and by applying to image denoising.}

We examine the co-regularization method used in the coregularized least squares (CoRLS) algorithm [12], in which the views are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSâs), and the disagreement penalty is the average squared diffrence in predictions. The final predictor is the pointwise average of the predictors from each view. We call the set of predictors that can result from this procedure the co-regularized hypothesis class. Our main result is a tight bound on the Rademacher complexity of the co-regularized hypothesis class in terms of the kernel matrices of each RKHS. We find that the co-regularization reduces the Rademacher complexity by an amount that depends on the distance between the two views, as measured by a data dependent metric. We then use standard techniques to bound the gap between training error and test error for the CoRLS algorithm. Experimentally, we find that the amount of reduction in complexity introduced by co-regularization correlates with the amount of improvement that co-regularization gives in the CoRLS algorithm.}

Under mild assumptions, we also find better error bounds than with ordinary neural networks. Furthermore, this parametrization may help reducing the problem of saturation of the neurons. In a second approach, the input-to-hidden weights are fully nonparametric, yielding a kernel machine for which we demonstrate a simple kernel formula. Interestingly, the resulting kernel machine can be made hyperparameter-free and still generalizes in spite of an absence of explicit regularization.}

We generalize a recent static co-occurrence model, the CODE model of Globerson et al. (2004), to the dynamic setting: we seek coordinates for each entity at each time step. The coordinates can change with time to explain new observations, but since large changes are improbable, we can exploit data at previous and subsequent steps to find a better explanation for current observations. To make inference tractable, we show how to approximate our observation model with a Gaussian distribution, allowing the use of a Kalman filter for tractable inference. The result is the first algorithm for dynamic embedding of co-occurrence data which provides distributional information for its coordinate estimates. We demonstrate our model both on synthetic data and on author-word data from the NIPS corpus, showing that it produces intuitively reasonable embeddings. We also provide evidence for the usefulness of our model by its performance on an author-prediction task.}

  abstract = 	 {Label ranking is the task of ordering labels with respect to their relevance to an input instance. We describe a unified approach for the online label ranking task. We do so by casting the online learning problem as a game against a competitor who receives all the examples in advance and sets its label ranker to be the optimal solution of a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem consists of two terms: the empirical label-ranking loss of the competitor and a complexity measure of the competitorâs ranking function. We then describe and analyze a framework for online label ranking that incrementally ascends the dual problem corresponding to the competitorâs optimization problem. The generality of our framework enables us to derive new online update schemes. In particular, we use the relative entropy as a complexity measure to derive efficient multiplicative algorithms for the label ranking task. Depending on the specific form of the instances, the multiplicative updates either have a closed form or can be calculated very efficiently by tailoring an interior point procedure to the label ranking task. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in a few experiments with email categorization tasks.}

MVE follows an approach similar to algorithms such as Semidefinite Embedding (SDE), in that it learns a kernel matrix using an SDP before applying Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA). However, the objective function for MVE directly optimizes the eigenspectrum of the data to preserve as much of its energy as possible within the few dimensions available to the embedding. Simultaneously, remaining eigenspectrum energy is minimized in directions orthogonal to the embedding thereby keeping data in a so-called minimum volume manifold. We show how MVE improves upon SDE in terms of the volume of the preserved embedding and the resulting eigenspectrum, producing better visualizations for a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including simple toy examples, face images, handwritten digits, phylogenetic trees, and social networks.}

We present fast kernel ICA (FastKICA), a novel optimisation technique for one such kernel independence measure, the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). Our search procedure uses an approximate Newton method on the special orthogonal group, where we estimate the Hessian locally about independence. We employ incomplete Cholesky decomposition to efficiently compute the gradient and approximate Hessian. FastKICA results in more accurate solutions at a given cost compared with gradient descent, and is relatively insensitive to local minima when initialised far from independence. These properties allow kernel approaches to be extended to problems with larger numbers of sources and observations. Our method is competitive with other modern and classical ICA approaches in both speed and accuracy.}

The improved VC estimates are based on geometric arguments. By considering bounding ellipsoids instead of the usual bounding hyperspheres and assuming gap-tolerant classifiers, a linear classifier with a given margin is shown to shatter fewer points than previously estimated. This improved VC estimation method directly motivates a different estimator for the parameters of a linear classifier. Surprisingly, only VC-based arguments are needed to justify this modification to the SVM. The resulting technique is implemented using Semidefinite Programming (SDP) and is solvable in polynomial time. The new linear classifier also ensures certain invariances to affine transformations on the data which a standard SVM does not provide. We demonstrate that the technique can be kernelized via extensions to Hilbert spaces. Promising experimental results are shown on several standardized datasets.}

This paper presents a new state-splitting algorithm that addresses both these problems. The algorithm models more information about the dynamic context of a state during a split, enabling it to discover underlying states more effectively. Compared to previous top-down methods, the algorithm also touches a smaller fraction of the data per split, leading to faster model search and selection. Because of its efficiency and ability to avoid local minima, the state-splitting approach is a good way to learn HMMs even if the desired number of states is known beforehand. We compare our approach to previous work on synthetic data as well as several real-world data sets from the literature, revealing significant improvements in efficiency and test-set likelihoods. We also compare to previous algorithms on a sign-language recognition task, with positive results.}

There are many ways in which objects can be related, making automated analogical reasoning very challenging. Here we develop an approach which, given a set of pairs of related objects S = {A^1:B^1, A^2:B^2, ..., A^N:B^N }, measures how well other pairs A:B fit in with the set S. This addresses the question: is the relation between objects A and B analogous to those relations found in S? We recast this classical problem as a problem of Bayesian analysis of relational data. This problem is nontrivial because direct similarity between objects is not a good way of measuring analogies. For instance, the analogy between an electron around the nucleus of an atom and a planet around the Sun is hardly justified by isolated, non-relational, comparisons of an electron to a planet, and a nucleus to the Sun. We develop a generative model for predicting the existence of relationships and extend the framework of Ghahramani and Heller (2005) to provide a Bayesian measure for how analogous a relation is to other relations. This sheds new light on an old problem, which we motivate and illustrate through practical applications in exploratory data analysis.}

We show that a dynamic dependency test using an HFactMM takes advantage of both structural and parametric changes associated with changes in interaction. This is contrasted both theoretically and empirically with standard sliding window based dependence analysis.

A different approach is that of local regression, where many local experts account for their own part of space. In this paper we start by investigating the regimes in which these different approaches work well or fail. We then proceed to develop a new sparse GP approximation which is a combination of both the global and local approaches. Theoretically we show that it is derived as a natural extension of the framework developed by QuiÂ onero Candela and Rasmussen [2005] for n sparse GP approximations. We demonstrate the benefits of the combined approximation on some 1D examples for illustration, and on some large real-world data sets.}

New models that do not satisfy the exchangeability assumption but whose probability revisions only depend on the word counts of what has previously appeared, are introduced within this framework. We will refer to these models as two-stage conditional presence/abundance models since they, just like some recently introduced models for the abundance of rare species in ecology, seperate the issue of presence from the issue of abundance when present. We will see that the widely used TF-IDF heuristic for information retrieval follows naturally from these models by calculating a crossentropy. We will also discuss a connection between TF-IDF and file formats that seperate presence from abundance given presence.}

We give such visualization a new conceptualization as an information retrieval problem; a projection is good if neighbors of data points can be retrieved well based on the visualized projected points. This makes it possible to rigorously quantify goodness in terms of precision and recall. A method is introduced to optimize retrieval quality; it turns out to be an extension of Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, one of the earlier nonlinear projection methods, for which we give a new interpretation: it optimizes recall.

In this paper, we study the problem of learning the kernel hyperparameter in the context of the kernelized LASSO regression model.

As the kernel hyperparameter changes its value, the solution path can be traced exactly without having to train the model multiple times. As a result, the optimal solution can be identified efficiently. Some simulation results will be presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed kernel path algorithm.}

  abstract = 	 {A novel semi-supervised learning approach based on statistical physics is proposed in this paper. We treat each data point as an Ising spin and the interaction between pairwise spins is captured by the similarity between the pairwise points. The labels of the data points are treated as the directions of the corresponding spins. In semi-supervised setting, some of the spins have fixed directions (which corresponds to the labeled data), and our task is to determine the directions of other spins. An approach based on the Mean Field theory is proposed to achieve this goal. Finally the experimental results on both toy and real world data sets are provided to show the effectiveness of our method.}

We introduce a fast algorithm for computing mean shift based on the dual-tree. Unlike previous speed-up attempts, our algorithm maintains a relative error bound at each iteration, resulting in significantly more stable and accurate convergence. We demonstrate the benefit of our method in clustering experiments with real and synthetic data.}

  abstract = 	 {Kernel regression is a well-established method for nonlinear regression in which the target value for a test point is estimated using a weighted average of the surrounding training samples. The weights are typically obtained by applying a distance-based kernel function to each of the samples, which presumes the existence of a well-defined distance metric. In this paper, we construct a novel algorithm for supervised metric learning, which learns a distance function by directly minimizing the leave-one-out regression error. We show that our algorithm makes kernel regression comparable with the state of the art on several benchmark datasets, and we provide efficient implementation details enabling application to datasets with Â O(10k) instances. Further, we show that our algorithm can be viewed as a supervised variation of PCA and can be used for dimensionality reduction and high dimensional data visualization.}

We also demonstrate the performance of our tighter online computable performance guarantees through computational simulations.}

In this paper, we adapt it for Transductive Classification (TC) problems. Specifically, we formulate a Local Learning Regularizer (LL-Reg) which leads to a solution with the property that the label of each data point can be well predicted based on its neighbors and their labels. For model selection, an efficient way to compute the leave-one-out classification error is provided for the proposed and related algorithms. Experimental results using several benchmark datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}

A question that addresses the issue of how far one can go in this direction is: Given a regression procedure, however sophisticated it is, how many regression functions are estimated accurately? In this work, for a given sequence of prescribed estimation accuracy (in sample size), we give an upper bound (in terms of metric entropy) on the number of regression functions for which the accuracy is achieved. Interesting consequences on adaptive and sparse estimations are also given.}

Our main result shows that under mild conditions, LS-SVM for binaryclass classifications is equivalent to the hard margin SVM based on the well-known Mahalanobis distance measure. We further study the asymptotics of the hard margin SVM when the data dimensionality tends to infinity with a fixed sample size. Using recently developed theory on the asymptotics of the distribution of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, we show that under mild conditions, the equivalence result holds for the traditional Euclidean distance measure. These equivalence results are further extended to the multi-class case. Experimental results confirm the presented theoretical analysis.}

  abstract = 	 {Some real problems are more naturally modeled by hybrid Bayesian networks that consist of mixtures of continuous and discrete variables with their interactions described by equations and continuous probability distributions. However, inference in such general hybrid models is hard. Therefore, existing approaches either only deal with special instances, such as Conditional Linear Gaussians (CLGs), or approximate a general model with a restricted version and then perform inference on the simpler model. However, results thus obtained highly depend on the quality of the approximations. This paper describes an importance sampling-based algorithm that directly deals with hybrid Bayesian networks constructed in the most general settings and guarantees to converge to the correct answers given enough time.}

  abstract = 	 {A primary object of causal reasoning concerns what would happen to a system under certain interventions. Specifically, we are often interested in estimating the probability distribution of some random variables that would result from forcing some other variables to take certain values. The renowned do-calculus (Pearl 1995) gives a set of rules that govern the identification of such post-intervention probabilities in terms of (estimable) pre-intervention probabilities, assuming available a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that represents the underlying causal structure. However, a DAG causal structure is seldom fully testable given preintervention, observational data, since many competing DAG structures are equally compatible with the data. In this paper we extend the do-calculus to cover cases where the available causal information is summarized in a so-called partial ancestral graph (PAG) that represents an equivalence class of DAG structures. The causal assumptions encoded by a PAG are significantly weaker than those encoded by a full-blown DAG causal structure, and are in principle fully testable by observed conditional independence relations.}
