 abstract = {Specifying tasks with videos is a powerful technique towards acquiring novel and general robot skills. However, reasoning over mechanics and dexterous interactions can make it challenging to scale learning contact-rich manipulation. In this work, we focus on the problem of visual non-prehensile planar manipulation: given a video of an object in planar motion, find contact-aware robot actions that reproduce the same object motion. We propose a novel architecture, Differentiable Learning for Manipulation (\ours), that combines video decoding neural models with priors from contact mechanics by leveraging differentiable optimization and finite difference based simulation. Through extensive simulated experiments, we investigate the interplay between traditional model-based techniques and modern deep learning approaches. We find that our modular and fully differentiable architecture performs better than learning-only methods on unseen objects and motions. \url{https://github.com/baceituno/dlm}.},

 abstract = {3D scene graphs (3DSGs) are an emerging description; unifying symbolic, topological, and metric scene representations. However, typical 3DSGs contain hundreds of objects and symbols even for small environments; rendering task planning on the full graph impractical. We construct TASKOGRAPHY, the first large-scale robotic task planning benchmark over 3DSGs. While most benchmarking efforts in this area focus on vision-based planning, we systematically study symbolic planning, to decouple planning performance from visual representation learning. We observe that, among existing methods, neither classical nor learning-based planners are capable of real-time planning over full 3DSGs. Enabling real-time planning demands progress on both (a) sparsifying 3DSGs for tractable planning and (b) designing planners that better exploit 3DSG hierarchies. Towards the former goal, we propose SCRUB, a task-conditioned 3DSG sparsification method; enabling classical planners to match and in some cases surpass state-of-the-art learning-based planners. Towards the latter goal, we propose SEEK, a procedure enabling learning-based planners to exploit 3DSG structure, reducing the number of replanning queries required by current best approaches by an order of magnitude. We will open-source all code and baselines to spur further research along the intersections of robot task planning, learning and 3DSGs.},

 abstract = {Robots are commonly used for several industrial applications and some have made their mark even in households (e.g., the roomba). Undoubtedly these systems are impressive! However, they are very narrow in their functionality and we are not even close to building a robot butler. A central challenge is the ability to work with sensory observations and generalization to novel situations. While we do not prescribe a solution to this problem, we do provide a perspective on a few dominant ideas in robot learning for multi-task learning and generalization. This perspective suggests a counter-intuitive conclusion: the primary challenge in building generalizable robotic systems (e.g., a robot butler) is not in the learning algorithms or the hardware, but in how humans transfer their knowledge to robots. },

 abstract = {We propose a novel approach that biases actions during policy search by lifting the concept of redundancy resolution from multi-DoF robot kinematics to the level of the reward in deep reinforcement learning and evolution strategies. The key idea is to bias the distribution of executed actions in the sense that the immediate reward remains unchanged. The resulting biased actions favor secondary objectives yielding policies that are safer to apply on the real robot. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method, considered as policy search with redundant action bias (PSRAB), in a reaching and a pick-and-lift task with a 7-DoF Franka robot arm trained in RLBench - a recently introduced benchmark for robotic manipulation - using state-of-the-art TD3 deep reinforcement learning and OpenAIâs evolutionary strategy. We show that it is a flexible approach without the need of significant fine-tuning and interference with the main objective even across different policy search methods and tasks of different complexity. We evaluate our approach in simulation and on the real robot. Our project website with videos and further results can be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/redundant-action-bias},

 abstract = {Robot learning is a very promising topic for the future of automation and machine intelligence. Future robots should be able to autonomously acquire skills, learn to represent their environment, and interact with it. While these topics have been explored in simulation, real-world robot learning research seems to be still limited. This is due to the additional challenges encountered in the real-world, such as noisy sensors and actuators, safe exploration, non-stationary dynamics, autonomous environment resetting as well as the cost of running experiments for long periods of time. Unless we develop scalable solutions to these problems, learning complex tasks involving hand-eye coordination and rich contacts will remain an untouched vision that is only feasible in controlled lab environments. We propose dual-arm settings as platforms for robot learning. Such settings enable safe data collection for acquiring manipulation skills as well as training perception modules in a robot-supervised manner. They also ease the processes of resetting the environment. Furthermore, adversarial learning could potentially boost the generalization capability of robot learning methods by maximizing the exploration based on game-theoretic objectives while ensuring safety based on collaborative task spaces. In this paper, we will discuss the potential benefits of this setup as well as the challenges and research directions that can be pursued.},

Fusing information from multiple sensory modalities is promising â for example, recent works showed benefits from combining vision with haptic sensors or with audio data. Learning-based methods facilitate faster progress in this field by removing the need for manual feature engineering. However, the sensor properties and the choice of sensory modalities is still usually done  manually. Our blue-sky view is that we could simulate/emulate sensors with various properties, then infer which properties and combinations of sensors yield the best learning outcomes. This view would incentivize the development of novel, affordable sensors that can make a noticeable impact on the performance, robustness and ease of training classifiers, models and policies for robotics. This would motivate making hardware that provides signals complementary to the existing ones. As a result: we can significantly expand the realm of applicability of the learning-based approaches.},

 abstract = {Robots of the future are going to exhibit increasingly human-like and super-human intelligence in a myriad of different tasks. They are also likely going to fail and be incompliant with human preferences in increasingly subtle ways. Towards the goal of achieving autonomous robots, the robot learning community has made rapid strides in applying machine learning techniques to train robots through data and interaction. This makes the study of how best to audit these algorithms for checking their compatibility with humans, pertinent and urgent. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the AI Safety and Alignment communities and make the case that we need to urgently consider ways in which we can best audit our robot learning algorithms to check for failure modes, and ensure that when operating autonomously, they are indeed behaving in ways that the human algorithm designers intend them to. We believe that this is a challenging problem that will require efforts from the entire robot learning community, and do not attempt to provide a concrete framework for auditing. Instead, we outline high-level guidance and a possible approach towards formulating this framework which we hope will serve as a useful starting point for thinking about auditing in the context of robot learning.},

 abstract = {Sampling-based model-predictive control (MPC) is a promising tool for feedback control of robots with complex, non-smooth dynamics, and cost functions. However, the computationally demanding nature of sampling-based MPC algorithms has been a key bottleneck in their application to high-dimensional robotic manipulation problems in the real world. Previous methods have addressed this issue by running MPC in the task space while relying on a low-level operational space controller for joint control. However, by not using the joint space of the robot in the MPC formulation, existing methods cannot directly account for non-task space related constraints such as avoiding joint limits, singular configurations, and link collisions. In this paper, we develop a system for fast, joint space sampling-based MPC for manipulators that is efficiently parallelized using GPUs. Our approach can handle task and joint space constraints while taking less than 8ms~(125Hz) to compute the next control command. Further, our method can tightly integrate perception into the control problem by utilizing learned cost functions from raw sensor data. We validate our approach by deploying it on a Franka Panda robot for a variety of dynamic manipulation tasks. We study the effect of different cost formulations and MPC parameters on the synthesized behavior and provide key insights that pave the way for the application of sampling-based MPC for manipulators in a principled manner. We also provide highly optimized, open-source code to be used by the wider robot learning and control community.

 abstract = {Soft sensors have continued growing interest in robotics, due to their ability to enable both passive conformal contact from the material properties and active contact data from the sensor properties. However, the same properties of conformal contact result in faster deterioration of soft sensors and larger variations in their response characteristics over time and across samples, inhibiting their ability to be long-lasting and replaceable. ReSkin is a tactile soft sensor that leverages machine learning and magnetic sensing to offer a low-cost, diverse and compact solution for long-term use. Magnetic sensing separates the electronic circuitry from the passive interface, making it easier to replace interfaces as they wear out while allowing for a wide variety of form factors. Machine learning allows us to learn sensor response models that are robust to variations across fabrication and time, and our self-supervised learning algorithm enables finer performance enhancement with small, inexpensive data collection procedures. We believe that ReSkin opens the door to more versatile, scalable and inexpensive tactile sensation modules than existing alternatives.},

 abstract = {Algorithms for self-learning systems have made considerable progress in recent years, yet safety concerns and the need for additional instrumentation have so far largely limited learning experiments with real robots to well controlled lab settings. In this paper, we demonstrate how a small bipedal robot can autonomously learn to walk with minimal human intervention and with minimal instrumentation of the environment. We employ data-efficient off-policy deep reinforcement learning to learn to walk end-to-end, directly on hardware, using rewards that are computed exclusively from proprioceptive sensing. To allow the robot to autonomously adapt its behaviour to its environment, we additionally provide the agent with raw RGB camera images as input. By deploying two robots in different geographic locations while sharing data in a distributed learning setup, we achieve higher throughput and greater diversity of the training data. Our learning experiments constitute a step towards the long-term vision of learning âin the wildâ for legged robots, and, to our knowledge, represent the first demonstration of learning a deep neural network controller for bipedal locomotion directly on hardware.},

By combining continual learning with self-supervision, our robotic system learns online during deployment without external supervision. We conduct real-world experiments with robots localising in 3D floorplans. Our experiments show how the robot's semantic perception improves during deployment and how this translates into improved localisation, even across drastically different environments. We further study the risk of catastrophic forgetting that such a continuous learning setting poses. We find memory replay an effective measure to reduce forgetting and show how the robotic system can improve even when switching between different environments. On average, our system improves by 60% in segmentation and 10% in localisation accuracy compared to deployment of a fixed model, and it maintains this improvement while adapting to further environments.},

Recent research in pedestrian tracking has shown that motion can be inferred from inertial data using convolutional neural networks. A learned inertial displacement measurement can improve state estimation in challenging scenarios where leg odometry is unreliable, such as slipping and compressible terrains. Our work learns to estimate a displacement measurement from IMU data which is then fused with traditional leg odometry. Our approach greatly reduces the drift of proprioceptive state estimation, which is critical for legged robots deployed in vision and lidar denied environments such as foggy sewers or dusty mines. We compared results from an EKF and an incremental fixed-lag factor graph estimator using data from several real robot experiments crossing challenging terrains. Our results show a reduction of relative pose error by 37% in challenging scenarios when compared to a traditional kinematic-inertial estimator without learned measurement. We also demonstrate a 22% reduction in error when used with vision systems in visually degraded environments such as an underground mine.},

 abstract = {The goal of learning from demonstrations is to learn a policy for an agent (imitator) by mimicking the behavior in the demonstrations. Prior works on learning from demonstrations assume that the demonstrations are collected by a demonstrator that has the same dynamics as the imitator. However, in many real-world applications, this assumption is limiting -- to improve the problem of lack of data in robotics, we would like to be able to leverage demonstrations collected from agents with different dynamics. This can be challenging as the demonstrations might not even be feasible for the imitator. Our insight is that we can learn a feasibility metric that captures the likelihood of a demonstration being feasible by the imitator. We develop a feasibility MDP (f-MDP) and derive the feasibility score by learning an optimal policy in the f-MDP. Our proposed feasibility measure encourages the imitator to learn from more informative demonstrations, and disregard the far from feasible demonstrations. Our experiments on four simulated environments and on a real robot show that the policy learned with our approach achieves a higher expected return than prior works.

 abstract = {A long-cherished vision in robotics is to equip robots with skills that match the versatility and precision of humans. For example, when playing table tennis, a robot should be capable of returning the ball in various ways while precisely placing it at the desired location. A common approach to model such versatile behavior is to use a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, where each expert is a contextual motion primitive. However, learning such MoEs is challenging as most objectives force the model to cover the entire context space, which prevents specialization of the primitives resulting in rather low-quality components. Starting from maximum entropy reinforcement learning (RL), we decompose the objective into optimizing an individual lower bound per mixture component. Further, we introduce a curriculum by allowing the components to focus on a local context region, enabling the model to learn highly accurate skill representations. To this end, we use local context distributions that are adapted jointly with the expert primitives. Our lower bound advocates an iterative addition of new components, where new components will concentrate on local context regions not covered by the current MoE. This local and incremental learning results in a modular MoE model of high accuracy and versatility, where both properties can be scaled by adding more components on the fly. We demonstrate this by an extensive ablation and on two challenging simulated robot skill learning tasks. We compare our achieved performance to LaDiPS and HiREPS, a known hierarchical policy search method for learning diverse skills.},

 abstract = {From whirling ceiling fans to ticking clocks, the sounds that we hear subtly vary as we move through a scene. We ask whether these ambient sounds convey information about 3D scene structure and, if so, whether they provide a useful learning signal for multimodal models. To study this, we collect a dataset of paired audio and RGB-D recordings from a variety of quiet indoor scenes. We then train models that estimate the distance to nearby walls, given only audio as input. We also use these recordings to learn multimodal representations through self-supervision, by training a network to associate images with their corresponding sounds. These results suggest that ambient sound conveys a surprising amount of information about scene structure, and that it is a useful signal for learning multimodal features.},

 abstract = {Interacting with bins and containers is a fundamental task in robotics, making state estimation of the objects inside the bin critical. While robots often use cameras for state estimation, the visual modality is not always ideal due to occlusions and poor illumination. We introduce The Boombox, a container that uses sound to estimate the state of the contents inside a box. Based on the observation that the collision between objects and its containers will cause an acoustic vibration, we present a convolutional network for learning to reconstruct visual scenes. Although we use low-cost and low-power contact microphones to detect the vibrations, our results show that learning from multimodal data enables state estimation from affordable audio sensors. Due to the many ways that robots use containers, we believe the box will have a number of applications in robotics. Our project website is at: boombox.cs.columbia.edu},

 abstract = {In this paper, we explore whether a robot can learn to regrasp a diverse set of objects to achieve various desired grasp poses. Regrasping is needed whenever a robot's current grasp pose fails to perform desired manipulation tasks. Endowing robots with such an ability has applications in many domains such as manufacturing or domestic services. Yet, it is a challenging task due to the large diversity of geometry in everyday objects and the high dimensionality of the state and action space. In this paper, we propose a system for robots to take partial point clouds of an object and the supporting environment as inputs and output a sequence of pick-and-place operations to transform an initial object grasp pose to the desired object grasp poses. The key technique includes a neural stable placement predictor and a regrasp graph-based solution through leveraging and changing the surrounding environment. We introduce a new and challenging synthetic dataset for learning and evaluating the proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed system with both simulator and real-world experiments. More videos and visualization examples are available on our project webpage.},

In this work, we present a suite of simulated environments tailored towards tactile robotics and reinforcement learning. A simple and fast method of simulating optical tactile sensors is provided, where high-resolution contact geometry is represented as depth images. Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is used to learn successful policies across all considered tasks. A data-driven approach enables translation of the current state of a real tactile sensor to corresponding simulated depth images.

 abstract = {Rigid objects make distinctive sounds during manipulation. These sounds are a function of object features, such as shape and material, and of contact forces during manipulation. Being able to infer from sound an objectâs acoustic properties, how it is being manipulated, and what events it is participating in could augment and complement what robots can perceive from vision, especially in case of occlusion, low visual resolution, poor lighting, or blurred focus. Annotations on sound data are rare. Therefore, existing inference systems mostly include a sound renderer in the loop, and use analysis-by-synthesis to optimize for object acoustic properties. Optimizing parameters with respect to a non-differentiable renderer is slow and hard to scale to complex scenes. We present DiffImpact, a fully differentiable model for sounds rigid objects make during impacts, based on physical principles of impact forces, rigid object vibration, and other acoustic effects. Its differentiability enables gradient-based, efficient joint inference of acoustic properties of the objects and characteristics and timings of each individual impact. DiffImpact can also be plugged in as the decoder of an autoencoder, and trained end-to-end on real audio data, so that the encoder can learn to solve the inverse problem in a self-supervised way. Experiments demonstrate that our modelâs physics-based inductive biases make it more resource efficient and expressive than state-of-the-art pure learning-based alternatives, on both forward rendering of impact sounds and inverse tasks such as acoustic property inference and blind source separation of impact sounds.

This uncertainty can be loosely decoupled into lateral (e.g., keeping lane, turning) and longitudinal (e.g., accelerating, braking). We present a novel method that combines learned discrete policy rollouts with a focused decoder on subsets of the lane graph. The policy rollouts explore different goals given current observations, ensuring that the model captures lateral variability. Longitudinal variability is captured by our latent variable model decoder that is conditioned on various subsets of the lane graph. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes motion prediction dataset, and qualitatively demonstrates excellent scene compliance.

Most manipulation planning approaches rely on analytical models and carefully chosen abstractions/state-spaces to be effective. A central question is how models can be obtained from data that are not primarily accurate in their predictions, but, more importantly, enable efficient reasoning within a planning framework, while at the same time being closely coupled to perception spaces. We show that representing objects as signed-distance fields not only enables to learn and represent a variety of models with higher accuracy compared to point-cloud and occupancy measure representations, but also that SDF-based models are suitable for optimization-based planning. To demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we learn both kinematic and dynamic models to solve tasks that involve hanging mugs on hooks and pushing objects on a table. We can unify these quite different tasks within one framework, since SDFs are the common object representation. Video: https://youtu.be/ga8Wlkss7co},

In this document we argue that there are benefits to be gained, especially in robotics, by designing learning algorithms that exist in continuous time, as well as state, and only later discretizing the algorithms for implementation on traditional computing models, or mapping them directly onto analog hardware. We survey four arguments to support this approach: That continuum representations provide a unified theory of functions for robotic systems; That many algorithms formulated as temporally continuous demonstrate anytime properties; That we can exploit temporal sparsity to effect energy efficiency in both traditional and analog hardware; and that these algorithms reflect the instantiations of intelligence that have evolved in organisms. Further, we present learning algorithms that are derived from continuous representations.  Finally, we discuss robotic precedents for this approach, and conclude with the implications of using continuum representations in robotic systems.},

We leverage Probably Approximately Correct (PAC)-Bayes theory in order to train a policy with a guaranteed bound on performance on the training distribution. Our key idea for OOD detection then relies on the following intuition: violation of the performance bound on test environments provides evidence that the robot is operating OOD. We formalize this via statistical techniques based on p-values and concentration inequalities. The resulting approach (i) provides guaranteed confidence bounds on OOD detection, and (ii) is task-driven and sensitive only to changes that impact the robot's performance. We demonstrate our approach on a simulated example of grasping objects with unfamiliar poses or shapes. We also present both simulation and hardware experiments for a drone performing vision-based obstacle avoidance in unfamiliar environments (including wind disturbances and different obstacle densities). Our examples demonstrate that we can perform task-driven OOD detection within just a handful of trials.

In this paper, we propose FusionDepth, a novel two-stage network to advance the self-supervised monocular dense depth learning by leveraging low-cost sparse (e.g. 4-beam) LiDAR. Unlike the existing methods that use sparse LiDAR mainly in a manner of time-consuming iterative post-processing, our model fuses monocular image features and sparse LiDAR features to predict initial depth maps. Then, an efficient feed-forward refine network is further designed to correct the errors in these initial depth maps in pseudo-3D space with real-time performance. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods, as well as the sparse-LiDAR-based methods on both self-supervised monocular depth prediction and completion tasks. With the accurate dense depth prediction, our model outperforms the state-of-the-art sparse-LiDAR-based method (Pseudo-LiDAR++) by more than 68% for the downstream task monocular 3D object detection on the KITTI Leaderboard.

 abstract = {Legged locomotion is commonly studied and expressed as a discrete set of gait patterns, like walk, trot, gallop, which are usually treated as given and pre-programmed in legged robots for efficient locomotion at different speeds. However, fixing a set of pre-programmed gaits limits the generality of locomotion. Recent animal motor studies show that these conventional gaits are only prevalent in ideal flat terrain conditions while real-world locomotion is unstructured and more like bouts of intermittent steps. What principles could lead to both structured and unstructured patterns across mammals and how to synthesize them in robots? In this work, we take an analysis-by-synthesis approach and learn to move by minimizing mechanical energy. We demonstrate that learning to minimize energy consumption plays a key role in the emergence of natural locomotion gaits at different speeds in real quadruped robots. The emergent gaits are structured in ideal terrains and look similar to that of horses and sheep. The same approach leads to unstructured gaits in rough terrains which is consistent with the findings in animal motor control. We validate our hypothesis in both simulation and real hardware across natural terrains. Videos at https://energy-locomotion.github.io},

Learning to assemble complex 3D structures remains a challenging problem that requires drawing connections between target designs and building blocks, and creating valid assembly sequences considering structural stability and feasibility. To address the combinatorial complexity of the assembly tasks, we propose a multi-head attention graph representation that can be trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to encode the spatial relations and provide meaningful assembly actions. Combining structured representations with model-free RL and Monte-Carlo planning allows agents to operate with various target shapes and building block types. We design a hierarchical control framework that learns to sequence the building blocks to construct arbitrary 3D designs and ensures their feasibility, as we plan the geometric execution with the robot-in-the-loop. We demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed structured representation and our algorithmic solution in a series of simulated 3D assembly tasks with robotic evaluation, which showcases our methodâs ability to learn to construct stable structures with a large number of building blocks.

We propose a novel triplet loss formulation where the distance metric is based on "sequence matching", that is, the aggregation of temporal order-based Euclidean distances computed using single images. We use the same metric for mining negatives online during the training which helps the optimization process by selecting appropriate positives and harder negatives. To overcome the computational overhead of sequence matching for negative mining, we propose a 2D convolution based formulation of sequence matching for efficiently aggregating distances within a distance matrix computed using single images. We show that our proposed method achieves consistent gains in performance as demonstrated on four benchmark datasets. Source code available at https://github.com/oravus/SeqMatchNet.},

 abstract = {We propose a decentralized learning framework for robots to trade, price, and discover valuable machine learning (ML) training data. Todayâs robotic fleets, such as self-driving vehicles, can gather terabytes of rich video and LIDAR data in diverse, geo-distributed environments. Often, robots in one city or home might observe training data that is commonplace for them, but is actually a valuable, out-of-distribution (OoD) dataset to train robust ML models at robots elsewhere. However, simply sharing all this diverse data in cloud databases is infeasible due to limits on privacy and network bandwidth. Inspired by decentralized file sharing protocols like BitTorrent, we propose a novel system where each robot is provisioned with a learnable privacy filter and sharing model. Importantly, this sharing model attempts to predict and prioritize which sensory percepts are of high value to other robotic peers using a decentralized voting and feedback mechanism.  Our scheme naturally raises timely questions on data privacy and valuation as companies start to deploy robots in our homes, hospitals, and roads.  },

 abstract = {The goal of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to find an optimal policy given prerecorded trajectories. Many current approaches customize existing off-policy RL algorithms, especially actor-critic algorithms in which policy evaluation and improvement are iterated. However, the convergence of such approaches is not guaranteed due to the use of complex non-linear function approximation and an intertwined optimization process. By contrast, we propose a simple baseline algorithm for offline RL that only performs the policy evaluation step once so that the algorithm does not require complex stabilization schemes. Since the proposed algorithm is not likely to converge to an optimal policy, it is an appropriate baseline for actor-critic algorithms that ought to be outperformed if there is indeed value in iterative optimization in the offline setting. Surprisingly, we empirically find that the proposed algorithm exhibits competitive and sometimes even state-of-the-art performance in a subset of the D4RL offline RL benchmark. This result suggests that future work is needed to fully exploit the potential advantages of iterative optimization in order to justify the reduced stability of such methods.},

The manner in which the sensor contacts a stimulus is entangled with the tactile information about the geometry of the stimulus. In this work, we propose a supervised convolutional deep neural network model that learns to disentangle, in the latent space, the components of sensor deformations caused by contact geometry from those due to sliding-induced shear. The approach is validated by reconstructing unsheared tactile images from sheared images and showing they match unsheared tactile images collected with no sliding motion. In addition, the unsheared tactile images give a faithful reconstruction of the contact geometry that is not possible from the sheared data, and robust estimation of the contact pose that can be used for servo control sliding around various 2D shapes. Finally, the contact geometry reconstruction in conjunction with servo control sliding were used for faithful full object reconstruction of various 2D shapes. The methods have broad applicability to deep learning models for robots with a shear-sensitive sense of touch.},

Yet, most prior works have tackled cloth manipulation using exclusively single-arm quasi-static actions, which requires a large number of interactions for challenging initial cloth configurations and strictly limits the maximum cloth size by the robot's reach range. In this work, we demonstrate the effectiveness of dynamic flinging actions for cloth unfolding with our proposed self-supervised learning framework, FlingBot. Our approach learns how to unfold a piece of fabric from arbitrary initial configurations using a pick, stretch, and fling primitive for a dual-arm setup from visual observations. The final system achieves over 80% coverage within 3 actions on novel cloths, can unfold cloths larger than the system's reach range, and generalizes to T-shirts despite being trained on only rectangular cloths. We also finetuned FlingBot on a real-world dual-arm robot platform, where it increased the cloth coverage over 4 times more than the quasi-static baseline did. The simplicity of FlingBot combined with its superior performance over quasi-static baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of dynamic actions for deformable object manipulation.},

 abstract = {Real-world robotic tasks require complex reward functions. When we define the problem the robot needs to solve, we pretend that a designer specifies this complex reward exactly, and it is set in stone from then on. In practice, however, reward design is an iterative process: the designer chooses a reward, eventually encounters an "edge-case" environment where the reward incentivizes the wrong behavior, revises the reward, and repeats. What would it mean to rethink robotics problems to formally account for this iterative nature of reward design? We propose that the robot not take the specified reward for granted, but rather have uncertainty about it, and account for the future design iterations as future evidence. We contribute an Assisted Reward Design method that speeds up the design process by anticipating and influencing this future evidence: rather than letting the designer eventually encounter failure cases and revise the reward then, the method actively exposes the designer to such environments during the development phase. We test this method in a simplified autonomous driving task and find that it more quickly improves the car's behavior in held-out environments by proposing environments that are "edge cases" for the current reward.},

 abstract = {Effective robot learning often requires online human feedback and interventions that can cost significant human time, giving rise to the central challenge in interactive imitation learning: is it possible to control the timing and length of interventions to both facilitate learning and limit burden on the human supervisor? This paper presents ThriftyDAgger, an algorithm for actively querying a human supervisor given a desired budget of human interventions. ThriftyDAgger uses a learned switching policy to solicit interventions only at states that are sufficiently (1) novel, where the robot policy has no reference behavior to imitate, or (2) risky, where the robot has low confidence in task completion. To detect the latter, we introduce a novel metric for estimating risk under the current robot policy. Experiments in simulation and on a physical cable routing experiment suggest that ThriftyDAgger's intervention criteria balances task performance and supervisor burden more effectively than prior algorithms. ThriftyDAgger can also be applied at execution time, where it achieves a 100% success rate on both the simulation and physical tasks. A user study (N=10) in which users control a three-robot fleet while also performing a concentration task suggests that ThriftyDAgger increases human and robot performance by 58% and 80% respectively compared to the next best algorithm while reducing supervisor burden.},

We call this Learning Preferences and Policies in Parallel (LP3). By making different choices for how to learn the preference and how to optimize for the policy given the preference, we can obtain existing approaches (e.g., Lagrangian relaxation) and derive novel approaches that lead to better performance.

 abstract = {Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms are not sample efficient to train on multi-step tasks in complex domains, impeding their wider deployment in the real world. We address this problem by leveraging the insight that RL models trained to complete one set of tasks can be repurposed to complete related tasks when given just a handful of demonstrations. Based upon this insight, we propose See-SPOT-Run (SSR), a new computational approach to robot learning that enables a robot to complete a variety of real robot tasks in novel problem domains without task-specific training. SSR uses pretrained RL models to create vectors that represent model, task, and action relevance in demonstration and test scenes. SSR then compares these vectors via our Cycle Consistency Distance (CCD) metric to determine the next action to take. SSR completes 58% more task steps and 20% more trials than a baseline few-shot learning method that requires task-specific training. SSR also achieves a four order of magnitude improvement in compute efficiency and a 20% to three order of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to the baseline and to training RL models from scratch. To our knowledge, we are the first to address multi-step tasks from demonstration on a real robot without task-specific training, where both the visual input and action space output are high dimensional.

 abstract = {Long-horizon planning in realistic environments requires the ability to reason over sequential tasks in high-dimensional state spaces with complex dynamics. Classical motion planning algorithms, such as rapidly-exploring random trees, are capable of efficiently exploring large state spaces and computing long-horizon, sequential plans. However, these algorithms are generally challenged with complex, stochastic, and high-dimensional state spaces as well as in the presence of narrow passages, which naturally emerge in tasks that interact with the environment. Machine learning offers a promising solution for its ability to learn general policies that can handle complex interactions and high-dimensional observations. However, these policies are generally limited in horizon length. Our approach, Broadly-Exploring, Local-policy Trees (BELT), merges these two approaches to leverage the strengths of both through a task-conditioned, model-based tree search. BELT uses an RRT-inspired tree search to efficiently explore the state space. Locally, the exploration is guided by a task-conditioned, learned policy capable of performing general short-horizon tasks. This task space can be quite general and abstract; its only requirements are to be sampleable and to well-cover the space of useful tasks. This search is aided by a task-conditioned model that temporally extends dynamics propagation to allow long-horizon search and sequential reasoning over tasks. BELT is demonstrated experimentally to be able to plan long-horizon, sequential trajectories with a goal conditioned policy and generate plans that are robust.},

By contrast, existing methods that learn articulation models from raw observations typically only predict point estimates of the model parameters, which are insufficient to guarantee the safe manipulation of articulated objects. Our core contributions include a novel representation for distributions over rigid body transformations and articulation model parameters based on screw theory, von Mises-Fisher distributions, and Stiefel manifolds. Combining these concepts allows for an efficient, mathematically sound representation that implicitly satisfies the constraints that rigid body transformations and articulations must adhere to. Leveraging this representation, we introduce a novel deep learning based approach, DUST-net, that performs category-independent articulation model estimation while also providing model uncertainties. We evaluate our approach on several benchmarking datasets and real-world objects and compare its performance with two current state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that DUST-net can successfully learn distributions over articulation models for novel objects across articulation model categories, which generate point estimates with better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and effectively capture the uncertainty over predicted model parameters due to noisy inputs.

Many of these problems require optimization of functions defined on non-Euclidean domains like spheres, rotation groups, or spaces of positive-definite matrices. To do so, one must place a Gaussian process prior, or equivalently define a kernel, on the space of interest. Effective kernels typically reflect the geometry of the spaces they are defined on, but designing them is generally non-trivial. Recent work on the Riemannian MatÃ©rn kernels, based on stochastic partial differential equations and spectral theory of the LaplaceâBeltrami operator, offers promising avenues towards constructing such geometry-aware kernels. In this paper, we study techniques for implementing these kernels on manifolds of interest in robotics, demonstrate their performance on a set of artificial benchmark functions, and illustrate geometry-aware Bayesian optimization for a variety of robotic applications, covering orientation control, manipulability optimization, and  motion planning, while showing its improved performance.},

 abstract = {Trajectory prediction of road participants such as vehicles and pedestrians is crucial for autonomous driving. Recently, graph neural network (GNN) is widely adopted to capture the social interactions among the agents. Many GNN-based models formulate the prediction task as a single-agent prediction problem where multiple inference is needed for multi-agent prediction (which is common in practice), which leads to fundamental inconsistency in terms of homotopy as well as inefficiency for the memory and time. Moreover, even for models that do perform joint prediction, typically one centric agent is selected and all other agentsâ information is normalized based on that. Such centric-only normalization leads to asymmetric encoding of different agents in GNN, which might harm its performance.  In this work, we propose a efficient multi-agent prediction framework that can predict all agentsâ trajectories jointly by normalizing and processing all agentsâ information symmetrically and homogeneously with combined egocentirc and allocentric views. Experiments are conducted on two interaction-rich behavior datasets: INTERACTION (vehicles) and TrajNet++ (pedestrian). The results show that the proposed framework can significantly boost the inference speed of the GNN-based model for multi-agent prediction and achieve better performance. In the INTERACTION datasetâs challenge, the proposed model achieved the 1st place in the regular track and generalization track.},

While reinforcement learning provides a powerful framework for acquiring individual behaviors, the time needed to acquire each skill makes the prospect of a generalist robot trained with RL daunting. In this paper, we study how a large-scale collective robotic learning system can acquire a repertoire of behaviors simultaneously, sharing exploration, experience, and representations across tasks. In this framework, new tasks can be continuously instantiated from previously learned tasks improving overall performance and capabilities of the system. To instantiate this system, we develop a scalable and intuitive framework for specifying new tasks through user-provided examples of desired outcomes, devise a multi-robot collective learning system for data collection that simultaneously collects experience for multiple tasks, and develop a scalable and generalizable multi-task deep reinforcement learning method, which we call MT-Opt. We demonstrate how MT-Opt can learn a wide range of skills, including semantic picking (i.e., picking an object from a particular category), placing into various fixtures (e.g., placing a food item onto a plate), covering, aligning, and rearranging.  We train and evaluate our system on a set of 12 real-world tasks with data collected from 7 robots, and demonstrate the performance of our system both in terms of its ability to generalize to structurally similar new tasks, and acquire distinct new tasks more quickly by leveraging past experience.

 abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning algorithms require large and diverse datasets in order to learn successful policies for perception-based mobile navigation. However, gathering such datasets with a single robot can be prohibitively expensive. Collecting data with multiple different robotic platforms with possibly different dynamics is a more scalable approach to large-scale data collection. But how can deep reinforcement learning algorithms leverage such heterogeneous datasets? In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm with hierarchically integrated models (HInt). At training time, HInt learns separate perception and dynamics models, and at test time, HInt integrates the two models in a hierarchical manner and plans actions with the integrated model. This method of planning with hierarchically integrated models allows the algorithm to train on datasets gathered by a variety of different platforms, while respecting the physical capabilities of the deployment robot at test time. Our mobile navigation experiments show that HInt outperforms conventional hierarchical policies and single-source approaches.},

 abstract = {We introduce Language-Informed Latent Actions (LILA), a framework for learning natural language interfaces in the context of human-robot collaboration. LILA falls under the shared autonomy paradigm: in addition to providing discrete language inputs, humans are given a low-dimensional controller $-$ e.g., a 2 degree-of-freedom (DoF) joystick that can move left/right and up/down $-$ for operating the robot. LILA learns to use language to modulate this controller, providing users with a language-informed control space: given an instruction like "place the cereal bowl on the tray," LILA may learn a 2-DoF space where one dimension controls the distance from the robot's end-effector to the bowl, and the other dimension controls the robot's end-effector pose relative to the grasp point on the bowl. We evaluate LILA with real-world user studies, where users can provide a language instruction while operating a 7-DoF Franka Emika Panda Arm to complete a series of complex manipulation tasks. We show that LILA models are not only more sample efficient and performant than imitation learning and end-effector control baselines, but that they are also qualitatively preferred by users.},

In this paper, we propose exploration-bounded exploration actor-critic (EBE-AC), a novel deep RL approach to combine stochastic policy optimization with interpretable human knowledge. The human knowledge is defined as heuristic information based on both physical relationships between a robot and objects and binary signals of whether the robot has achieved certain states. The proposed approach, EBE-AC, combines an off-policy actor-critic algorithm with an entropy maximization based on the heuristic information. On a robotic manipulation task, we demonstrate that EBE-AC outperforms prior state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithms in terms of sample efficiency. In addition, we found that EBE-AC can be easily combined with latent information, where EBE-AC with latent information further improved sample efficiency and robustness.},

The ability to control stiffness facilitates safe and reliable manipulation by providing compliance and robustness to uncertainties. Most current reinforcement learning approaches to achieve robotic manipulation have exclusively focused on position control, often due to the difficulty of learning high-dimensional stiffness control policies. This difficulty can be partially mitigated via policy guidance such as imitation learning. However, expert stiffness control demonstrations are often expensive or infeasible to record. Therefore, we present an approach to learn Stiffness Control from Augmented Position control Experiences (SCAPE) that bypasses this difficulty by transforming position control demonstrations into approximate, suboptimal stiffness control demonstrations. Then, the suboptimality of the augmented demonstrations is addressed by using complementary techniques that help the agent safely learn from both the demonstrations and reinforcement learning. By using simulation tools and experiments on a robotic testbed, we show that the proposed approach efficiently learns safe manipulation policies and outperforms learned position control policies and several other baseline learning algorithms.},

 abstract = {Robot manipulation of unknown objects in unstructured environments is a challenging problem due to the variety of shapes, materials, arrangements and lighting conditions. Even with large-scale real-world data collection, robust perception and manipulation of transparent and reflective objects across various lighting conditions remain challenging. To address these challenges we propose an approach to performing sim-to-real transfer of robotic perception. The underlying model, SimNet, is trained as a single multi-headed neural network using simulated stereo data as input and simulated object segmentation masks, 3D oriented bounding boxes (OBBs), object keypoints, and disparity as output. A key component of SimNet is the incorporation of a learned stereo sub-network that predicts disparity. SimNet is evaluated on 2D car detection, unknown object detection, and deformable object keypoint detection and significantly outperforms a baseline that uses a structured light RGB-D sensor. By inferring grasp positions using the OBB and keypoint predictions, SimNet can be used to perform end-to-end manipulation of unknown objects in both easy and hard scenarios using our fleet of Toyota HSR robots in four home environments. In unknown object grasping experiments, the predictions from the baseline RGB-D network and SimNet enable successful grasps of most of the easy objects. However, the RGB-D baseline only grasps 35% of the hard (e.g., transparent) objects, while SimNet grasps 95%, suggesting that SimNet can enable robust manipulation of unknown objects, including transparent objects, in unknown environments.},

This can allow robots to acquire generalizable skills from large and diverse datasets, without any costly or unsafe online data collection. Despite recent algorithmic advances in offline RL, applying these methods to real-world problems has proven challenging. Although offline RL methods can learn from prior data, there is no clear and well-understood process for making various design choices, from model architecture to algorithm hyperparameters, without actually evaluating the learned policies online. In this paper, our aim is to develop a practical workflow for using offline RL analogous to the relatively well-understood workflows for supervised learning problems. To this end, we devise a set of metrics and conditions that can be tracked over the course of offline training, and can inform the practitioner about how the algorithm and model architecture should be adjusted to improve final performance. Our workflow is derived from a conceptual understanding of the behavior of conservative offline RL algorithms and cross-validation in supervised learning. We demonstrate the efficacy of this workflow in producing effective policies without any online tuning, both in several simulated robotic learning scenarios and for three tasks on two distinct real robots, focusing on learning manipulation skills with raw image observations with sparse binary rewards.

Meanwhile, physics simulators are effective at modeling complex interactions between objects but are typically more computationally expensive. Learning when to switch between the various models can greatly improve the speed of planning and task success reliability. In this work, we learn model deviation estimators (MDEs) to predict the error between real-world states and the states outputted by transition models. MDEs can be used to define a model precondition that describes which transitions are accurately modeled. We then propose a planner that uses the learned model preconditions to switch between various models in order to use models in conditions where they are accurate, prioritizing faster models when possible.

 abstract = {We propose Parallelised Diffeomorphic Sampling-based Motion Planning (PDMP). PDMP is a novel parallelised framework that uses bijective and differentiable mappings, or diffeomorphisms, to transform sampling distributions of sampling-based motion planners, in a manner akin to normalising flows. Unlike normalising flow models which use invertible neural network structures to represent these diffeomorphisms, we develop them from gradient information of desired costs, and encode desirable behaviour, such as obstacle avoidance. These transformed sampling distributions can then be used for sampling-based motion planning. A particular example is when we wish to imbue the sampling distribution with knowledge of the environment geometry, such that drawn samples are less prone to be in collisions. To this end, we propose to learn a continuous occupancy representation from environment occupancy data, such that gradients of the representation defines a valid diffeomorphism and is amenable to fast parallel evaluation. We use this to "morph" the sampling distribution to draw far fewer collision-prone samples. PDMP is able to leverage gradient information of costs, to inject specifications, in a manner similar to optimisation-based motion planning methods, but relies on drawing from a sampling distribution, retaining the tendency to find more global solutions, thereby bridging the gap between trajectory optimisation and sampling-based planning methods.},

Often the foremost among such bottlenecks is the need for human effort, including the effort of curating and labeling datasets. As a result, considerable attention in recent years has been devoted to utilizing unlabeled data, which can be collected in vast quantities. However, some of the most widely used methods for training on such unlabeled data themselves require human-designed objective functions that must correlate in some meaningful way to downstream tasks. I will argue that a general, principled, and powerful framework for utilizing unlabeled data can be derived from reinforcement learning, using general purpose unsupervised or self-supervised reinforcement learning objectives in concert with offline reinforcement learning methods that can leverage large datasets. I will discuss how such a procedure is more closely aligned with potential downstream tasks, and how it could build on existing techniques that have been developed in recent years.},

We show that a dynamics model, constructed over the learned representation space, enables visuomotor control for challenging manipulation tasks involving both rigid bodies and fluids, where the target is specified in a viewpoint different from what the robot operates on. When coupled with an auto-decoding framework, it can even support goal specification from camera viewpoints that are outside the training distribution.

 abstract = {Recent research in embodied AI has been boosted by the use of simulation environments to develop and train robot learning approaches. However, the use of simulation has skewed the attention to tasks that only require what robotics simulators can simulate: motion and physical contact. We present iGibson 2.0, an open-source simulation environment that supports the simulation of a more diverse set of household tasks through three key innovations. First, iGibson 2.0 supports object states, including temperature, wetness level, cleanliness level, and toggled and sliced states, necessary to cover a wider range of tasks. Second, iGibson 2.0 implements a set of predicate logic functions that map the simulator states to logic states like Cooked or Soaked. Additionally, given a logic state, iGibson 2.0 can sample valid physical states that satisfy it. This functionality can generate potentially infinite instances of tasks with minimal effort from the users. The sampling mechanism allows our scenes to be more densely populated with small objects in semantically meaningful locations. Third, iGibson 2.0 includes a virtual reality (VR) interface to immerse humans in its scenes to collect demonstrations. As a result, we can collect demonstrations from humans on these new types of tasks, and use them for imitation learning. We evaluate the new capabilities of iGibson 2.0 to enable robot learning of novel tasks, in the hope of demonstrating the potential of this new simulator to support new research in embodied AI. iGibson 2.0 and its new dataset are publicly available at http://svl.stanford.edu/igibson/.},

 abstract = {Risk awareness is an important factor to consider when deploying policies on robots in the real-world. Defining the right set of risk metrics can be difficult. In this work, we use a differentiable logic monitor that keeps track of the environmental agentsâ behaviors and provides a risk metric that the controlled agent can incorporate during planning. We introduce LogicRiskNet, a learning structure that can be constructed from temporal logic formulas describing rules governing a safe agentâs behaviors. The networkâs parameters can be learned from demonstration data. By using temporal logic, the network provides an interpretable architecture that can explain what risk metrics are important to the human.  We integrate LogicRiskNet in an inverse optimal control (IOC) framework and show that we can learn to generate trajectory plans that accurately mimic the expertâs risk handling behaviors solely from demonstration data. We evaluate our method on a real-world driving dataset. },

 abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown effective in domains where the agent can learn policies by actively interacting with its operating environment. However, if we change the RL scheme to offline setting where the agent can only update its policy via static datasets, one of the major issues in offline reinforcement learning emerges, i.e. distributional shift. We propose a Pessimistic Offline Reinforcement Learning (PessORL) algorithm to actively lead the agent back to the area where it is familiar by manipulating the value function. We focus on problems caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and deliberately penalize high values at states that are absent in the training dataset, so that the learned pessimistic value function lower bounds the true value anywhere within the state space. We evaluate the PessORL algorithm on various benchmark tasks, where we show that our method gains better performance by explicitly handling OOD states, when compared to those methods merely considering OOD actions.},

Existing work mainly focuses on generating the scene graph from the sensory information collected from a pre-defined path, while the environment should be exhaustively explored with a carefully designed path in order to obtain a comprehensive semantic scene graph efficiently. In this paper, we propose a new task of Embodied Semantic Scene Graph Generation, which exploits the embodiment of the intelligent agent to autonomously generate an appropriate path to explore the environment for scene graph generation. To this end, a learning framework with the paradigms of imitation learning and reinforcement learning is proposed to help the agent generate proper actions to explore the environment and the scene graph is incrementally constructed. The proposed method is evaluated on the AI2Thor environment using both the quantitative and qualitative performance indexes. Additionally, we implement the proposed method on a streaming video captioning task and promising experimental results are achieved.},

 abstract = {Robotic manipulation of cloth remains challenging for robotics due to the complex dynamics of the cloth, lack of a low-dimensional state representation, and self-occlusions. In contrast to previous model-based approaches that learn a pixel-based dynamics model or a compressed latent vector dynamics, we propose to learn a particle-based dynamics model from a partial point cloud observation. To overcome the challenges of partial observability, we infer which visible points are connected on the underlying cloth mesh. We then learn a dynamics model over this visible connectivity graph. Compared to previous learning-based approaches, our model poses strong inductive bias with its particle based representation for learning the underlying cloth physics; it is invariant to visual features; and the predictions can be more easily visualized. We show that our method greatly outperforms previous state-of-the-art model-based and model-free reinforcement learning methods in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate zero-shot sim-to-real transfer where we deploy the model trained in simulation on a Franka arm and show that the model can successfully smooth different types of cloth from crumpled configurations.

Unlike vision-based state estimators, proprioceptive state estimators are agnostic to perceptually degraded situations such as dark or foggy scenes. While some robots are equipped with dedicated physical sensors to detect necessary contact data for state estimation, some robots do not have dedicated contact sensors, and the addition of such sensors is non-trivial without redesigning the hardware. The trained network can estimate contact events on different terrains. The experiments show that a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter can generate accurate odometry trajectories compared to a state-of-the-art visual SLAM system, enabling robust proprioceptive odometry.},

Unlike most traditional robotic development processes that are essentially process-centric, RoboFlow is data-centric. This striking property makes it especially suitable for developing AI-enhanced robots in which data play a central role. More specifically, RoboFlow models the whole robotic development process into 4 building modules (1. data processing, 2. algorithmic development, 3. back testing and 4. application adaptation) interacting with a centralized data engine. All these building modules are containerized and orchestrated under a unified interfacing framework. Such an architectural design greatly increases the maintainability and re-usability of all the building modules and enables us to develop them in a fully parallel fashion. To demonstrate the efficacy of the developed system, we exploit it to develop two prototype systems named âEgomobility" and âEgoplan". Egomobility provides general-purpose navigation functionalities for a wide variety of mobile robots and Egoplan solves path planning problems in high dimensional continuous state and action spaces for robot arms. Our result shows that RoboFlow can significantly streamline the whole development lifecycle and the same workflow is applicable to numerous intelligent robotic applications.},

 abstract = {Learning complex manipulation tasks in realistic, obstructed environments is a challenging problem due to hard exploration in the presence of obstacles and high-dimensional visual observations. Prior work tackles the exploration problem by integrating motion planning and reinforcement learning. However, the motion planner augmented policy requires access to state information, which is often not available in the real-world settings. To this end, we propose to distill a state-based motion planner augmented policy to a visual control policy via (1) visual behavioral cloning to remove the motion planner dependency along with its jittery motion, and (2) vision-based reinforcement learning with the guidance of the smoothed trajectories from the behavioral cloning agent. We evaluate our method on three manipulation tasks in obstructed environments and compare it against various reinforcement learning and imitation learning baselines. The results demonstrate that our framework is highly sample-efficient and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, coupled with domain randomization, our policy is capable of zero-shot transfer to unseen environment settings with distractors. Code and videos are available at https://clvrai.com/mopa-pd},

 abstract = {Robotic skills can be learned via imitation learning (IL) using user-provided demonstrations, or via reinforcement learning (RL) using large amounts of autonomously collected experience. Both methods have complementary strengths and weaknesses: RL can reach a high level of performance, but requires exploration, which can be very time consuming and unsafe; IL does not require exploration, but only learns skills that are as good as the provided demonstrations. Can a single method combine the strengths of both approaches? A number of prior methods have aimed to address this question, proposing a variety of techniques that integrate elements of IL and RL. However, scaling up such methods to complex robotic skills that integrate diverse offline data and generalize meaningfully to real-world scenarios still presents a major challenge. In this paper, our aim is to test the scalability of prior IL + RL algorithms and devise a system based on detailed empirical experimentation that combines existing components in the most effective and scalable way.  To that end, we present a series of experiments aimed at understanding the implications of each design decision, so as to develop a combined approach that can utilize demonstrations and heterogeneous prior data to attain the best performance on a range of real-world and realistic simulated robotic problems.

We propose DexVIP, an approach to learn dexterous robotic grasping from human-object interactions present in in-the-wild YouTube videos. We do this by curating grasp images from human-object interaction videos and imposing a prior over the agent's hand pose when learning to grasp with deep reinforcement learning. A key advantage of our method is that the learned policy is able to leverage free-form in-the-wild visual data. As a result, it can easily scale to new objects, and it sidesteps the standard practice of collecting human demonstrations in a lab -- a much more expensive and indirect way to capture human expertise. Through experiments on 27 objects with a 30-DoF simulated robot hand, we demonstrate that DexVIP compares favorably to existing approaches that lack a hand pose prior or rely on specialized tele-operation equipment to obtain human demonstrations, while also being faster to train.

On the other hand, task and motion planning (TAMP) methods scale to long horizons but they are computationally expensive and need to precisely track world state. We propose a method that draws on the strength of both methods: we train a policy to imitate a TAMP solverâs output. This produces a feed-forward policy that can accomplish multi-step tasks from sensory data. First, we build an asynchronous distributed TAMP solver that can produce supervision data fast enough for imitation learning. Then, we propose a hierarchical policy architecture that lets us use partially trained control policies to speed up the TAMP solver. In robotic manipulation tasks with 7-DoF joint control, the partially trained policies reduce the time needed for planning by a factor of up to 2.6. Among these tasks, we can learn a policy that solves the RoboSuite 4-object pick-place task 88% of the time from object pose observations and a policy that solves the RoboDesk 9-goal benchmark 79% of the time from RGB images (averaged across the 9 disparate tasks).},

 abstract = {Exploiting past 3D LiDAR scans to predict future point clouds is a promising method for autonomous mobile systems to realize foresighted state estimation, collision avoidance, and planning. In this paper, we address the problem of predicting future 3D LiDAR point clouds given a sequence of past LiDAR scans. Estimating the future scene on the sensor level does not require any preceding steps as in localization or tracking systems and can be trained self-supervised. We propose an end-to-end approach that exploits a 2D range image representation of each 3D LiDAR scan and concatenates a sequence of range images to obtain a 3D tensor. Based on such tensors, we develop an encoder-decoder architecture using 3D convolutions to jointly aggregate spatial and temporal information of the scene and to predict the future 3D point clouds. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and the experimental results suggest that our method outperforms existing point cloud prediction architectures and generalizes well to new, unseen environments without additional fine-tuning. Our method operates online and is faster than the common LiDAR frame rate of 10 Hz.},

 abstract = {Rolling shutter distortion is highly undesirable for photography and computer vision algorithms (e.g., visual SLAM) because pixels can be potentially captured at different times and poses. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network to predict depth and row-wise pose from a single image for rolling shutter correction. Our contribution in this work is to incorporate inertial measurement unit (IMU) data into the pose refinement process, which, compared to the state-of-the-art, greatly enhances the pose prediction. The improved accuracy and robustness make it possible for numerous vision algorithms to use imagery captured by rolling shutter cameras and produce highly accurate results. We also extend a dataset to have real rolling shutter images, IMU data, depth maps, camera poses, and corresponding global shutter images for rolling shutter correction training. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by evaluating the performance of Direct Sparse Odometry (DSO) algorithm on rolling shutter imagery corrected using the proposed approach. Results show marked improvements of the DSO algorithm over using uncorrected imagery, validating the proposed approach.},

There is a rich space of object-object interaction scenarios in our daily life, such as placing an object on a messy tabletop, fitting an object inside a drawer, pushing an object using a tool, etc. In this paper, we propose a unified affordance learning framework to learn object-object interaction for various tasks. By constructing four object-object interaction task environments using physical simulation (SAPIEN) and thousands of ShapeNet models with rich geometric diversity, we are able to conduct large-scale object-object affordance learning without the need for human annotations or demonstrations. At the core of technical contribution, we propose an object-kernel point convolution network to reason about detailed interaction between two objects. Experiments on large-scale synthetic data and real-world data prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

In this paper, we propose to apply novel view synthesis to the robot relocalization problem: we demonstrate improvement of camera pose regression thanks to an additional synthetic dataset rendered by the NeRF class of algorithm. To avoid spawning novel views in irrelevant places we selected virtual camera locations from NeRF internal representation of the 3D geometry of the scene. We further improved localization accuracy of pose regressors using synthesized realistic and geometry consistent images as data augmentation during training. At the time of publication, our approach improved state of the art with a 60% lower error on Cambridge Landmarks and 7-scenes datasets. Hence, the resulting accuracy becomes comparable to structure-based methods, without any architecture modification or domain adaptation constraints. Since our method allows almost infinite generation of training data, we investigated limitations of camera pose regression depending on size and distribution of data used for training on public benchmarks. We concluded that pose regression accuracy is mostly bounded by relatively small and biased datasets rather than capacity of the pose regression model to solve the localization task.},

 abstract = {Combining domain randomization and reinforcement learning is a widely used approach to obtain control policies that can bridge the gap between simulation and reality. However, existing methods make limiting assumptions on the form of the domain parameter distribution which prevents them from utilizing the full power of domain randomization. Typically, a restricted family of probability distributions (e.g., normal or uniform) is chosen a priori for every parameter. Furthermore, straightforward approaches based on deep learning require differentiable simulators, which are either not available or can only simulate a limited class of systems. Such rigid assumptions diminish the applicability of domain randomization in robotics. Building upon recently proposed neural likelihood-free inference methods, we introduce Neural Posterior Domain Randomization (NPDR), an algorithm that alternates between learning a policy from a randomized simulator and adapting the posterior distribution over the simulatorâs parameters in a Bayesian fashion. Our approach only requires a parameterized simulator, coarse prior ranges, a policy (optionally with optimization routine), and a small set of real-world observations. Most importantly, the domain parameter distribution is not restricted to a specific family, parameters can be correlated, and the simulator does not have to be differentiable. We show that the presented method is able to efficiently adapt the posterior over the domain parameters to closer match the observed dynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that NPDR can learn transferable policies using fewer real-world rollouts than comparable algorithms.},

For backchanneling to be effective, it is important that the timing of such cues is appropriate given the humansâ conversational behaviors. Recent progress has shown that these behaviors can be learned from datasets of human-human conversations. However, recent data-driven methods tend to overfit to the human speakers that are seen in training data and fail to generalize well to previously unseen speakers. In this paper, we explore the use of data augmentation for effective nodding behavior in a robot. We show that, by augmenting the input speech and visual features, we can produce data-driven models that are more robust to unseen features without collecting additional data. We analyze the efficacy of data-driven backchanneling in a realistic human-robot conversational setting with a user study, showing that users perceived the data-driven model to be better at listening as compared to rule-based and random baselines.},

However, expert feedback is often assumed to be drawn from an underlying unimodal reward function. This assumption does not always hold including in settings where multiple experts provide data or when a single expert provides data for different tasks -- we thus go beyond learning a unimodal reward and focus on learning a multimodal reward function. We formulate the multimodal reward learning as a mixture learning problem and develop a novel ranking-based learning approach, where the experts are only required to rank a given set of trajectories. Furthermore, as access to interaction data is often expensive in robotics, we develop an active querying approach to accelerate the learning process. We conduct experiments and user studies using a multi-task variant of OpenAI's LunarLander and a real Fetch robot, where we collect data from multiple users with different preferences. The results suggest that our approach can efficiently learn multimodal reward functions, and improve data-efficiency over benchmark methods that we adapt to our learning problem.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of learning a range of vision-based manipulation tasks from a large offline dataset of robot interaction. In order to accomplish this, humans need easy and effective ways of specifying tasks to the robot. Goal images are one popular form of task specification, as they are already grounded in the robot's observation space. However, goal images also have a number of drawbacks: they are inconvenient for humans to provide, they can over-specify the desired behavior leading to a sparse reward signal, or under-specify task information in the case of non-goal reaching tasks. Natural language provides a convenient and flexible alternative for task specification, but comes with the challenge of grounding language in the robot's observation space. To scalably learn this grounding we propose to leverage offline robot datasets (including highly sub-optimal, autonomously collected data) with crowd-sourced natural language labels. With this data, we learn a simple classifier which predicts if a change in state completes a language instruction. This provides a language-conditioned reward function that can then be used for offline multi-task RL. In our experiments, we find that on language-conditioned manipulation tasks our approach outperforms both goal-image specifications and language conditioned imitation techniques by more than 25%, and is able to perform visuomotor tasks from natural language, such as "open the right drawer" and "move the stapler", on a Franka Emika Panda robot.},

 abstract = {When learning common skills like driving, beginners usually have domain experts standing by to ensure the safety of the learning process. We formulate such learning scheme under the Expert-in-the-loop Reinforcement Learning where a guardian is introduced to safeguard the exploration of the learning agent. While allowing the sufficient exploration in the uncertain environment, the guardian intervenes under dangerous situations and demonstrates the correct actions to avoid potential accidents. Thus ERL enables both exploration and expert's partial demonstration as two training sources. Following such a setting, we develop a novel Expert Guided Policy Optimization (EGPO) method which integrates the guardian in the loop of reinforcement learning. The guardian is composed of an expert policy to generate demonstration and a switch function to decide when to intervene. Particularly, a constrained optimization technique is used to tackle the trivial solution that the agent deliberately behaves dangerously to deceive the expert into taking over. Offline RL technique is further used to learn from the partial demonstration generated by the expert. Safe driving experiments show that our method achieves superior training and test-time safety, outperforms baselines with a substantial margin in sample efficiency, and preserves the generalizabiliy to unseen environments in test-time.

We first learn a set of reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations (SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages the provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the primitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior demonstration-guided RL approaches.

Manually collected datasets impose inherent limitations on the variability of test cases and it is particularly difficult to acquire challenging scenarios, e.g. ones involving collisions with pedestrians. A way to alleviate this is to consider automatic generation of safety-critical scenarios for autonomous vehicle (AV) testing. Existing approaches for scenario generation use heuristic pedestrian behavior models. We instead propose a framework that can use state-of-the-art pedestrian motion models, which is achieved by reformulating the problem as learning where to place pedestrians such that the induced scenarios are collision prone for a given AV. Our pedestrian initial location model can be used in conjunction with any goal driven pedestrian model which makes it possible to challenge an AV with a wide range of pedestrian behaviors â this ensures that the AV can avoid collisions with any pedestrian it encounters. We show that it is possible to learn a collision seeking scenario generation model when both the pedestrian and AV are collision avoiding. The initial location model is conditioned on scene semantics and occlusions to ensure semantic and visual plausibility, which increases the realism of generated scenarios. Our model can be used to test any AV model given sufficient constraints.},

In practice, the unstructured step-based exploration used in Deep RL -- often very successful in simulation -- leads to jerky motion patterns on real robots. Consequences of the resulting shaky behavior are poor exploration, or even damage to the robot. We address these issues by adapting state-dependent exploration (SDE) to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this adaptation, we propose two extensions to the original SDE, using more general features and re-sampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE permits to have a compromise between performance and smoothness, which allows training directly on the real robots without loss of performance.

 abstract = {If a robotâs dynamics are difficult to model solely through analytical mechanics, it is an attractive option to directly learn it from data. Yet, solely data-driven approaches require considerable amounts of data for training and do not extrapolate well to unseen regions of the systemâs state space. In this work, we emphasize that when a robotâs links are sufficiently rigid, many analytical functions such as kinematics, inertia functions, and surface constraints encode informative prior knowledge on its dynamics. To this effect, we propose a framework for learning probabilistic forward dynamics that combines physics knowledge with Gaussian processes utilizing automatic differentiation with GPU acceleration. Compared to solely data-driven modeling, the modelâs data efficiency improves while the model also respects physical constraints. We illustrate the proposed structured model on a seven joint robot arm in PyBullet. Our implementation of the proposed framework can be found here: https://git.io/JP4Fs},

 abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) consists in learning a so-called world model, a representation of the environment through interactions with it, then use it to train an agent. This approach is particularly interesting in the con-text of field robotics, as it alleviates the need to train online, and reduces the risks inherent to directly training agents on real robots. Generally, in such approaches, the world encompasses both the part related to the robot itself and the rest of the environment. We argue that decoupling the environment representation (for example, images or laser scans) from the dynamics of the physical system (that is, the robot and its physical state) can increase the flexibility of world models and open doors to greater robustness. In this paper, we apply this concept to a strong latent-agent, Dreamer. We then showcase the increased flexibility by transferring the environment part of the world model from one robot (a boat) to another (a rover), simply by adapting the physical model in the imagination. We additionally demonstrate the robustness of our method through real-world experiments on a boat.},

 abstract = {This position paper proposes a fresh look at Reinforcement Learning (RL) from the perspective of data-efficiency. Data-efficient RL has gone through three major stages: pure on-line RL where every data-point is considered only once, RL with a replay buffer where additional learning is done on a portion of the experience, and finally transition memory based RL, where, conceptually, all transitions are stored and re-used in every update step. While inferring knowledge from all explicitly stored experience has lead to a tremendous gain in data-efficiency, the question of how this data is collected has been vastly understudied. We argue that data-efficiency can only be achieved through careful consideration of both aspects. We propose to make this insight explicit via a paradigm that we call 'Collect and Infer', which explicitly models RL as two separate but interconnected processes, concerned with data collection and knowledge inference respectively. We discuss implications of the paradigm, how its ideas are reflected in the literature, and how it can guide future research into data efficient RL.},

Specifically, given a reconstructed 3D scene in the form of point clouds with 3D bounding boxes of potential object candidates, and a language utterance referring to a target object in the scene, our model successfully identifies the target object from a set of potential candidates. Specifically, LanguageRefer uses a transformer-based architecture that combines spatial embedding from bounding boxes with fine-tuned language embeddings from DistilBert to predict the target object. We show that it performs competitively on visio-linguistic datasets proposed by ReferIt3D. Further, we analyze its spatial reasoning task performance decoupled from perception noise, the accuracy of view-dependent utterances, and viewpoint annotations for potential robotics applications.},

Probabilistic movement primitives (ProMPs) stand out as a principled approach that models trajectory distributions learned from demonstrations. ProMPs allow for trajectory modulation and blending to achieve better generalization to novel situations. However, when ProMPs are employed in operational space, their original formulation does not directly apply to full-pose movements including rotational trajectories described by quaternions. This paper proposes a Riemannian formulation of ProMPs that enables encoding and retrieving of quaternion trajectories. Our method builds on Riemannian manifold theory, and exploits multilinear geodesic regression for estimating the ProMPs parameters. This novel approach makes ProMPs a suitable model for learning complex full-pose robot motion patterns. Riemannian ProMPs are tested on toy examples to illustrate their workflow, and on real learning-from-demonstration experiments.},

Camera RGBD data provides rich information of the objects surrounding the robot, and shape priors can help correct noise and fill in gaps and occluded regions. However, when the robot senses unexpected contact, the estimate should be updated to explain the contact. To address this need, we propose CLASP: Constrained Latent Shape Projection. This approach consists of a shape completion network that generates a prior from RGBD data and a procedure to generate shapes consistent with both the network prior and robot contact observations.

We demonstrate this in simulation as well as deploy our model to self-driving vehicles in the real-world. Our method outperforms previously demonstrated state-of-the-art for urban driving scenarios -- all this without the need for complex state perturbations or collecting additional on-policy data during training.

A deep learning module is often responsible for this task, requiring large-scale, high-quality training datasets.

However, despite its appeal, there has been little scientific analysis of active learning approaches for the perception and prediction (P&P) problem.

We combine finite-horizon rollouts from a latent model with value function estimates to predict infinite-horizon returns and recover associated uncertainty through ensembling.

This requires a robot to reason about both semantics (what objects are present?) and geometric properties (where are the objects located?) of the environment. To achieve this goal, we develop a novel Birdâs Eye View Network (BEVNet), a deep neural network that directly predicts a local map encoding terrain classes from sparse LiDAR inputs. BEVNet processes both geometric and semantic information in a temporally consistent fashion. More importantly, it uses learned prior and history to predict terrain classes in unseen space and into the future, allowing a robot to better appraise its situation.

Additionally, we propose a self-guided policy improvement method by combining policy-gradient with zero-order optimization to search for actions associated with higher Q-values in a broad neighborhood.

Recent works in manipulation have shown that end-to-end networks can learn dexterous skills that require precise spatial reasoning, but these methods often fail to generalize to new goals or quickly learn transferable concepts across tasks. In parallel, there has been great progress in learning generalizable semantic representations for vision and language by training on large-scale internet data, however these representations lack the spatial understanding necessary for fine-grained manipulation. To this end, we propose a framework that combines the best of both worlds: a two-stream architecture with semantic and spatial pathways for vision-based manipulation. Specifically, we present CLIPort, a language-conditioned imitation-learning agent that combines the broad semantic understanding (what) of CLIP [1] with the spatial precision (where) of Transporter [2]. Our end-to-end framework is capable of solving a variety of language-specified tabletop tasks from packing unseen objects to folding cloths, all without any explicit representations of object poses, instance segmentations, memory, symbolic states, or syntactic structures. Experiments in simulated and real-world settings show that our approach is data efficient in few-shot settings and generalizes effectively to seen and unseen semantic concepts.

 abstract = {Terrain adaptation is a critical ability for a ground robot to effectively traverse unstructured off-road terrain in real-world field environments such as forests. However, the expected or planned maneuvering behaviors cannot always be accurately executed due to setbacks such as reduced tire pressure. This inconsistency negatively affects the robotâs ground maneuverability and can cause slower traversal time or errors in localization.  To address this shortcoming, we propose a novel method for consistent behavior generation that enables a ground robotâs actual behaviors to more accurately match expected behaviors while adapting to a variety of complex off-road terrains. Our method learns offset behaviors in a self-supervised fashion to compensate for the inconsistency between the actual and expected behaviors without requiring the explicit modeling of various setbacks. To evaluate the method, we perform extensive experiments using a physical ground robot over diverse complex off-road terrain in real-world field environments.  Experimental results show that our method enables a robot to improve its ground maneuverability on complex unstructured off-road terrain with more navigational behavior consistency, and outperforms previous and baseline methods, particularly so on challenging terrain such as that which is seen in forests.},

 abstract = {We address the problem of learning observation models end-to-end for estimation. Robots operating in partially observable environments must infer latent states from multiple sensory inputs using observation models that capture the joint distribution between latent states and observations. This inference problem can be formulated as an objective over a graph that optimizes for the most likely sequence of states using all previous measurements. Prior work uses observation models that are either known a-priori or trained on surrogate losses independent of the graph optimizer. In this paper, we propose a method to directly optimize end-to-end tracking performance by learning observation models with the graph optimizer in the loop. This direct approach may appear, however, to require the inference algorithm to be fully differentiable, which many state-of-the-art graph optimizers are not. Our key insight is to instead formulate the problem as that of energy-based learning. We propose a novel approach, LEO, for learning observation models end-to-end with graph optimizers that may be non-differentiable. LEO alternates between sampling trajectories from the graph posterior and updating the model to match these samples to ground truth trajectories. We propose a way to generate such samples efficiently using incremental Gauss-Newton solvers. We compare LEO against baselines on datasets drawn from two distinct tasks: navigation and real-world planar pushing. We show that LEO is able to learn complex observation models with lower errors and fewer samples. Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/YqzlUPudfkA},

Building such a benchmark poses three fundamental difficulties for each activity: definition (it can differ by time, place, or person), instantiation in a simulator, and evaluation. BEHAVIOR addresses these with three innovations. First, we propose an object-centric, predicate logic-based description language for expressing an activity's initial and goal conditions, enabling generation of diverse instances for any activity. Second, we identify the simulator-agnostic features required by an underlying environment to support BEHAVIOR, and demonstrate its realization in one such simulator. Third, we introduce a set of metrics to measure task progress and efficiency, absolute and relative to human demonstrators. We include 500 human demonstrations in virtual reality (VR) to serve as the human ground truth. Our experiments demonstrate that even state of the art embodied AI solutions struggle with the level of realism, diversity, and complexity imposed by the activities in our benchmark.

 abstract = { Enabling human operators to interact with robotic agents using natural language would allow non-experts to intuitively instruct these agents. Towards this goal, we propose a novel Transformer-based model which enables a user to guide a robot arm through a 3D multi-step manipulation task with natural language commands. Our system maps images and commands to masks over grasp or place locations, grounding the language directly in perceptual space. In a suite of block rearrangement tasks, we show that these masks can be combined with an existing manipulation framework without re-training, greatly improving learning efficiency. Our masking model is several orders of magnitude more sample efficient than typical Transformer models, operating with hundreds, not millions, of examples. Our modular design allows us to leverage supervised and reinforcement learning, providing an easy interface for experimentation with different architectures. Our model completes block manipulation tasks with synthetic commands $530%$ more often than a UNet-based baseline, and learns to localize actions correctly while creating a mapping of symbols to perceptual input that supports compositional reasoning. We provide a valuable resource for 3D manipulation instruction following research by porting an existing 3D block dataset with crowdsourced language to a simulated environment. Our methodâs $25.3%$ absolute improvement in identifying the correct block on the ported dataset demonstrates its ability to handle syntactic and lexical variation. },

Our aim is to devise a robotic reinforcement learning system for learning navigation and manipulation together, in an autonomous way without human intervention, enabling continual learning under realistic assumptions. Our proposed system, ReLMM, can learn continuously on a real-world platform without any environment instrumentation, without human intervention, and without access to privileged information, such as maps, objects positions, or a global view of the environment. Our method employs a modularized policy with components for manipulation and navigation, where manipulation policy uncertainty drives exploration for the navigation controller, and the manipulation module provides rewards for navigation. We evaluate our method on a room cleanup task, where the robot must navigate to and pick up items scattered on the floor. After a grasp curriculum training phase, ReLMM can learn navigation and grasping together fully automatically, in around 40 hours of autonomous real-world training.},

 abstract = {While machines and robots must interact with humans, providing them with social skills has been a largely overlooked topic. This is mostly a consequence of the fact that tasks such as navigation, command following, and even game playing are well-defined, while social reasoning still mostly remains a pre-theoretic problem. We demonstrate how social interactions can be effectively incorporated into MDPs by reasoning recursively about the goals of other agents. In essence, our method extends the reward function to include a combination of physical goals (something agents want to accomplish in the configuration space, a traditional MDP) and social goals (something agents want to accomplish relative to the goals of other agents). Our Social MDPs allow specifying reward functions in terms of the estimated reward functions of other agents, modeling interactions such as helping or hindering another agent (by maximizing or minimizing the other agentâs reward) while balancing this with the actual physical goals of each agent. Our formulation allows for an arbitrary function of another agentâs estimated reward structure and physical goals, enabling more complex behaviors such as politely hindering another agent or aggressively helping them. Extending Social MDPs in the same manner as I-POMDPs extension would enable interactions such as convincing another agent that something is true. To what extent the Social MDPs presented here and their potential Social POMDPs variant account for all possible social interactions is unknown, but having a precise mathematical model to guide questions about social interactions has both practical value (we demonstrate how to make zero-shot social inferences and one could imagine chatbots and robots guided by Social MDPs) and theoretical value by bringing the tools of MDP that have so successfully organized research around navigation to hopefully shed light on what social interactions really are given their extreme importance to human well-being and human civilization.},

 abstract = {Seemingly simple natural language requests to a robot are generally underspecified, for example "Can you bring me the wireless mouse?" Flat images of candidate mice may not provide the discriminative information needed for "wireless." The world, and objects in it, are not flat images but complex 3D shapes. If a human requests an object based on any of its basic properties, such as color, shape, or texture, robots should perform the necessary exploration to accomplish the task. In particular, while substantial effort and progress has been made on understanding explicitly visual attributes like color and category, comparatively little progress has been made on understanding language about shapes and contours. In this work, we introduce a novel reasoning task that targets both visual and non-visual language about 3D objects. Our new benchmark, ShapeNet Annotated with Referring Expressions (SNARE) requires a model to choose which of two objects is being referenced by a natural language description. We introduce several CLIP-based models for distinguishing objects and demonstrate that while recent advances in jointly modeling vision and language are useful for robotic language understanding, it is still the case that these image-based models are weaker at understanding the 3D nature of objects -- properties which play a key role in manipulation. We find that adding view estimation to language grounding models improves accuracy on both SNARE and when identifying objects referred to in language on a robot platform, but note that a large gap remains between these models and human performance.},

 abstract = {Modern self-driving perception systems have been shown to improve upon processing complementary inputs such as LiDAR with images. In isolation, 2D images have been found to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Yet, there have been limited studies on the adversarial robustness of multi-modal models that fuse LiDAR features with image features. Furthermore, existing works do not consider physically realizable perturbations that are consistent across the input modalities. In this paper, we showcase practical susceptibilities of multi-sensor detection by placing an adversarial object on top of a host vehicle. We focus on physically realizable and input-agnostic attacks as they are feasible to execute in practice, and show that a single universal adversary can hide different host vehicles from state-of-the-art multi-modal detectors. Our experiments demonstrate that successful attacks are primarily caused by easily corrupted image features. Furthermore, we find that in modern sensor fusion methods which project image features into 3D, adversarial attacks can exploit the projection process to generate false positives across distant regions in 3D. Towards more robust multi-modal perception systems, we show that adversarial training with feature denoising can boost robustness to such attacks significantly. However, we find that standard adversarial defenses still struggle to prevent false positives which are also caused by inaccurate associations between 3D LiDAR points and 2D pixels.},

We illustrate the framework in a coverage task resembling household vacuum cleaning. Through a virtual interface, we collect a dataset of human attributions to robot trajectories during task execution and learn a probabilistic model that maps trajectories to attributions. We then incorporate this model into a trajectory generation mechanism that balances between task completion and communication of a desired behavioral attribute.

We start by investigating the differential stiffness of a hollow, cone-shaped, 3D metamaterial made from soft rubber, achieving a large stiffness ratio between the axial and radial directions that leads to an adaptive form response in omni-directions during physical interaction. Then, using image data collected from its internal deformation during various interactions, we explored two similar designs but different learning strategies to estimate force control and interactions on the end-effector of a UR10 e-series robot arm. One is to directly learn the force and torque response from raw images of the metamaterialâs internal deformation. The other is to indirectly estimate the 6D force and torque using a neural network by visually tracking the 6D pose of a marker fixed inside the 3D metamaterial. Finally, we integrated the two proposed systems and achieved similar force feedback and control interactions in simple tasks such as circle following and text writing. Our results show that the learning method holds the potential to support the concept of soft robot force control, providing an intuitive interface at a low cost for robotic systems, generating comparable and capable performances against classical force and torque sensors.},

Our architecture extracts 2D features from multiple camera images and then uses a sparse set of 3D object queries to index into these 2D features, linking 3D positions to multi-view images using camera transformation matrices. Finally, our model makes a bounding box prediction per object query, using a set-to-set loss to measure the discrepancy between the ground-truth and the prediction. This top-down approach outperforms its bottom-up counterpart in which object bounding box prediction follows per-pixel depth estimation, since it does not suffer from the compounding error introduced by a depth prediction model. Moreover, our method does not require post-processing such as non-maximum suppression, dramatically improving inference speed.

In these environments, predicting the robotâs trajectory can be challenging due to the complexity of terrain interactions, as well as the divergent dynamics that cause model uncertainty to compound and propagate poorly. This inhibits the robotâs long horizon decision making capabilities and often lead to shortsighted navigation strategies. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for rough terrain traversal that trains a probabilistic dynamics model to consider the propagating effects of uncertainty. During trajectory predictions, a trajectory tracking controller is considered to predict closed-loop trajectories. Our method further increases prediction accuracy and precision by using constrained optimization to find trajectories with low divergence. Using this method, wheeled robots can find non-myopic control strategies to reach destinations with higher probability of success. We show results on simulated and real world robots navigating through rough terrain environments.},

 abstract = {Modern imitation learning (IL) utilizes deep neural networks (DNNs) as function approximators to mimic the policy of the expert demonstrations. However, DNNs can be easily fooled by subtle noise added to the input, which is even non-detectable by humans. This makes the learned agent vulnerable to attacks, especially in IL where agents can struggle to recover from the errors. In such light, we propose a sound Adversarially Robust Imitation Learning (ARIL) method. In our setting, an agent and an adversary are trained alternatively. The former with adversarially attacked input at each timestep mimics the behavior of an online expert and the latter learns to add perturbations on the states by forcing the learned agent to fail on choosing the right decisions. We theoretically prove that ARIL can achieve adversarial robustness and evaluate ARIL on multiple benchmarks from DM Control Suite. The result reveals that our method (ARIL) achieves better robustness compare with other imitation learning methods under both sensory attack and physical attack.},

 abstract = {We focus on the problem of planning the motion of a robot in a dynamic multiagent environment such as a pedestrian scene. Enabling the robot to navigate safely and in a socially compliant fashion in such scenes requires a representation that accounts for the unfolding multiagent dynamics. Existing approaches to this problem tend to employ microscopic models of motion prediction that reason about the individual behavior of other agents. While such models may achieve high tracking accuracy in trajectory prediction benchmarks, they often lack an understanding of the group structures unfolding in crowded scenes. Inspired by the Gestalt theory from psychology, we build a Model Predictive Control framework (G-MPC) that leverages group-based prediction for robot motion planning. We conduct an extensive simulation study involving a series of challenging navigation tasks in scenes extracted from two real-world pedestrian datasets. We illustrate that G-MPC enables a robot to achieve statistically significantly higher safety and lower number of group intrusions than a series of baselines featuring individual pedestrian motion prediction models. Finally, we show that G-MPC can handle noisy lidar-scan estimates without significant performance losses.},

We learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the other agent's strategy and the dynamics of how the latent strategy evolves with respect to our robot's behavior. With this learned dynamics model, we can define an unsupervised stability reward to train our robot to deliberately influence the other agent to stabilize towards a single strategy.

To better align skill extraction with human intent we present Skill Preferences (SkiP), an algorithm that learns a model over human preferences and uses it to extract human-aligned skills from offline data. After extracting human-preferred skills, SkiP also utilizes human feedback to solve down-stream tasks with RL.

 abstract = {3D object detection is an important capability needed in various practical applications such as driver assistance systems. Monocular 3D detection, as a representative general setting among image-based approaches, provides a more economical solution than conventional settings relying on LiDARs but still yields unsatisfactory results. This paper first presents a systematic study on this problem. We observe that the current monocular 3D detection can be simplified as an instance depth estimation problem: The inaccurate instance depth blocks all the other 3D attribute predictions from improving the overall detection performance. Moreover, recent methods directly estimate the depth based on isolated instances or pixels while ignoring the geometric relations across different objects. To this end, we construct geometric relation graphs across predicted objects and use the graph to facilitate depth estimation. As the preliminary depth estimation of each instance is usually inaccurate in this ill-posed setting, we incorporate a probabilistic representation to capture the uncertainty. It provides an important indicator to identify confident predictions and further guide the depth propagation. Despite the simplicity of the basic idea, our method, PGD, obtains significant improvements on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, achieving 1st place out of all monocular vision-only methods while still maintaining real-time efficiency.

These models are relevant to robotics because many robotics problems can be expressed in a rotationally symmetric way. This paper focuses on equivariance over a visual state space and a spatial action space -- the setting where the robot action space includes a subset of $\rm{SE}(2)$. In this situation, we know a priori that rotations and translations in the state image should result in the same rotations and translations in the spatial action dimensions of the optimal policy. Therefore, we can use equivariant model architectures to make $Q$ learning more sample efficient. This paper identifies when the optimal $Q$ function is equivariant and proposes $Q$ network architectures for this setting. We show experimentally that this approach outperforms standard methods in a set of challenging manipulation problems.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive success in exploring high-dimensional environments to learn complex tasks, but can often exhibit unsafe behaviors and require extensive environment interaction when exploration is unconstrained. A promising strategy for learning in dynamically uncertain environments is requiring that the agent can robustly return to learned safe sets, where task success (and therefore safety) can be guaranteed. While this approach has been successful in low-dimensions, enforcing this constraint in environments with visual observations is exceedingly challenging. We present a novel continuous representation for safe sets by framing it as a binary classification problem in a learned latent space, which flexibly scales to image observations. We then present a new algorithm, Latent Space Safe Sets (LS3), which uses this representation for long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards. We evaluate LS3 on 4 domains, including a challenging sequential pushing task in simulation and a physical cable routing task. We find that LS3 can use prior task successes to restrict exploration and learn more efficiently than prior algorithms while satisfying constraints.

In this work, we explore how to apply imitation learning (IL) to learn continuous visuo-motor policies for MM tasks. Much prior work has shown that IL can train visuo-motor policies for either manipulation or navigation domains, but few works have applied IL to the MM domain. Doing this is challenging for two reasons: on the data side, current interfaces make collecting high-quality human demonstrations difficult, and on the learning side, policies trained on limited data can suffer from covariate shift when deployed. To address these problems, we first propose Mobile Manipulation RoboTurk (MoMaRT), a novel teleoperation framework allowing simultaneous navigation and manipulation of mobile manipulators, and collect a first-of-its-kind large scale dataset in a realistic simulated kitchen setting. We then propose a learned error detection system to address the covariate shift by detecting when an agent is in a potential failure state. We train performant IL policies and error detectors from this data, and achieve over 45% task success rate and 85% error detection success rate across multiple multi-stage tasks when trained on expert data.

 abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of learning a repertoire of low-level skills from raw images that can be sequenced to complete long-horizon visuomotor tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for acquiring short-horizon skills autonomously. However, the focus of RL algorithms has largely been on the success of those individual skills, more so than learning and grounding a large repertoire of skills that can be sequenced to complete extended multi-stage tasks. The latter demands robustness and persistence, as errors in skills can compound over time, and may require the robot to have a number of primitive skills in its repertoire, rather than just one. To this end, we introduce EMBER, a model-based RL method for learning primitive skills that are suitable for completing long-horizon visuomotor tasks. EMBER learns and plans using a learned model, critic, and success classifier, where the success classifier serves both as a reward function for RL and as a grounding mechanism to continuously detect if the robot should retry a skill when unsuccessful or under perturbations. Further, the learned model is task-agnostic and trained using data from all skills, enabling the robot to efficiently learn a number of distinct primitives. These visuomotor primitive skills and their associated pre- and post-conditions can then be directly combined with off-the-shelf symbolic planners to complete long-horizon tasks. On a Franka Emika robot arm, we find that EMBER enables the robot to complete three long-horizon visuomotor tasks at 85% success rate, such as organizing an office desk, a file cabinet, and drawers, which require sequencing up to 12 skills, involve 14 unique learned primitives, and demand generalization to novel objects.},

However, in real applications, the depth estimation may be halted at any time, due to the random interruptions or low energy capacity of battery when using powerful sensors like 3D LiDAR. To address this problem, we propose a depth estimation method that is robust to random halts and relies on energy-saving 2D LiDAR and a monocular camera. To this end, we formulate the depth estimation as an anytime problem and propose a new metric to evaluate its robustness under random interruptions. Our final model has only 2M parameters with a marginal accuracy loss compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Indeed, our experiments on NYU Depth v2 dataset show that our model is capable of processing 224$\times$224 resolution images and 2D point clouds with any computation budget larger than 6.37ms (157 FPS) and 0.2J on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2 system. Evaluations on KITTI dataset under supervised and self-supervised training show similar results.},

 abstract = {We propose a visually-grounded library of behaviors approach for learning to manipulate diverse objects across varying initial and goal configurations and camera placements. Our key innovation is to disentangle the standard image-to-action mapping into two separate modules that use different types of perceptual input: (1) a behavior selector which conditions on intrinsic and semantically-rich object appearance features to select the behaviors that can successfully perform the desired tasks on the object in hand, and (2) a library of behaviors each of which conditions on extrinsic and abstract object properties, such as object location and pose, to predict actions to execute over time. The selector uses a semantically-rich 3D object feature representation extracted from images in a differential end-to-end manner. This representation is trained to be view-invariant and affordance-aware using self-supervision, by predicting varying views and successful object manipulations. We test our framework on pushing and grasping diverse objects in simulation as well as transporting rigid, granular, and liquid food ingredients in a real robot setup. Our model outperforms image-to-action mappings that do not factorize static and dynamic object properties. We further ablate the contribution of the selectorâs input and show the benefits of the proposed view-predictive, affordance-aware 3D visual object representations.},

 abstract = {We focus on the problem of developing energy efficient controllers for quadrupedal robots. Animals can actively switch gaits at different speeds to lower their energy consumption. In this paper, we devise a hierarchical learning framework, in which distinctive locomotion gaits and natural gait transitions emerge automatically with a simple reward of energy minimization. We use evolutionary strategies (ES) to train a high-level gait policy that specifies gait patterns of each foot, while the low-level convex MPC controller optimizes the motor commands so that the robot can walk at a desired velocity using that gait pattern. We test our learning framework on a quadruped robot and demonstrate automatic gait transitions, from walking to trotting and to fly-trotting, as the robot increases its speed. We show that the learned hierarchical controller consumes much less energy across a wide range of locomotion speed than baseline controllers.},

 abstract = {Vision is one of the essential perception modalities for legged robots to safely and efficiently navigate uneven terrains, such as stairs and stepping stones. However,  training robots to effectively understand high-dimensional visual input for locomotion is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a framework to train a vision-based locomotion controller which enables a quadrupedal robot to traverse uneven environments. The key idea is to introduce a hierarchical structure with a high-level vision policy and a low-level motion controller. The high-level vision policy takes as inputs the perceived vision signals as well as robot states and outputs the desired footholds and base movement of the robot. These are then realized by the low level motion controller composed of a position controller for swing legs and a MPC-based torque controller for stance legs. We train the vision policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning and demonstrate our approach on a variety of uneven environments such as randomly placed stepping stones, quincuncial piles, stairs, and moving platforms. We also validate our method on a real robot to walk over a series of gaps and climbing up a platform.},

 abstract = {Sequential manipulation tasks require a robot to perceive the state of an environment and plan a sequence of actions leading to a desired goal state. In such tasks, the ability to reason about spatial relations among object entities from raw sensor inputs is crucial in order to determine when a task has been completed and which actions can be executed. In this work, we propose SORNet (Spatial Object-Centric Representation Network), a framework for learning object-centric representations from RGB images conditioned on a set of object queries, represented as image patches called canonical object views. With only a single canonical view per object and no annotation, SORNet generalizes zero-shot to object entities whose shape and texture are both unseen during training. We evaluate SORNet on various spatial reasoning tasks such as spatial relation classification and relative direction regression in complex tabletop manipulation scenarios and show that SORNet significantly outperforms baselines including state-of-the-art representation learning techniques. We also demonstrate the application of the representation learned by SORNet on visual-servoing and task planning for sequential manipulation on a real robot.},

 abstract = {To successfully tackle challenging manipulation tasks, autonomous agents must learn a diverse set of skills and how to combine them. Recently, self-supervised agents that set their own abstract goals by exploiting the discovered structure in the environment were shown to perform well on many different tasks. In particular, some of them were applied to learn basic manipulation skills in compositional multi-object environments. However, these methods learn skills without taking the dependencies between objects into account. Thus, the learned skills are difficult to combine in realistic environments. We propose a novel self-supervised agent that estimates relations between environment components and uses them to independently control different parts of the environment state. In addition, the estimated relations between objects can be used to decompose a complex goal into a compatible sequence of subgoals. We show that, by using this framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn manipulation tasks in multi-object environments with different relations between objects.},

We represent movable objects separately from the immovable background, and recover a full 3D model of each distinct object as well as their spatial relations in the scene. We leverage transformer-based detectors and neural implicit 3D representations and we build a Scene Decomposition Network (SDN) that reconstructs the scene in 3D. Furthermore, we show that this reconstruction can be used in an analysis-by-synthesis setting via differentiable rendering. Trained only on simulated road scenes, our method generalizes well to real data in the same class without any adaptation thanks to its strong inductive priors. Experiments on two synthetic-real dataset pairs (PD-DDAD and VKITTI-KITTI) show that our method can robustly recover scene geometry and appearance, as well as reconstruct and re-render the scene from novel viewpoints.},

 abstract = {We investigate the visual cross-embodiment imitation setting, in which agents learn policies from videos of other agents (such as humans) demonstrating the same task, but with stark differences in their embodiments -- shape, actions, end-effector dynamics, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover and learn vision-based reward functions from cross-embodiment demonstration videos that are robust to these differences. Specifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency constraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing the same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work, producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the learned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for embodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring real-world human demonstrations to a simulated robot, we find that XIRL is more sample efficient than current best methods.

 abstract = {While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has impressive performance in a variety of continuous control tasks, one critical hurdle that limits the application of DRL to physical world is the lack of safety guarantees. It is challenging for DRL agents to persistently satisfy a hard state constraint (known as the safety specification) during training. On the other hand, safe control methods with safety guarantees have been extensively studied. However, to synthesize safe control, these methods require explicit analytical models of the dynamic system; but these models are usually not available in DRL. This paper presents a model-free safe control strategy to synthesize safeguards for DRL agents, which will ensure zero safety violation during training. In particular, we present an implicit safe set algorithm, which synthesizes the safety index (also called the barrier certificate) and the subsequent safe control law only by querying a black-box dynamic function (e.g., a digital twin simulator). The theoretical results indicate the implicit safe set algorithm guarantees forward invariance and finite-time convergence to the safe set. We validate the proposed method on the state-of-the-art safety benchmark Safety Gym. Results show that the proposed method achieves zero safety violation and gains $ 95% \pm 9%$ cumulative reward compared to state-of-the-art safe DRL methods. Moreover, it can easily scale to high-dimensional systems.},

 abstract = {As robots are deployed in complex situations, engineers and end users must develop a holistic understanding of their behaviors, capabilities, and limitations. Some behaviors are directly optimized by the objective function. They often include success rate, completion time or energy consumption. Other behaviors -- e.g., collision avoidance, trajectory smoothness or motion legibility -- are typically emergent but equally important for safe and trustworthy deployment. Designing an objective which optimizes every aspect of robot behavior is hard. In this paper, we advocate for systematic analysis of a wide array of behaviors for holistic understanding of robot controllers and, to this end, propose a framework, RoCUS, which uses Bayesian posterior sampling to find situations where the robot controller exhibits user-specified behaviors, such as highly jerky motions. We use RoCUS to analyze three controller classes (deep learning models, rapidly exploring random trees and dynamical system formulations) on two domains (2D navigation and a 7 degree-of-freedom arm reaching), and uncover insights to further our understanding of these controllers and ultimately improve their designs.},

Existing methods often formulate it as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem, solved in an encoder-decoder framework with a maximum likelihood estimation objective. State-of-the-art models leverage contextual information including the map and states of surrounding agents. However,  we observe that they still assign a high probability to unlikely trajectories resulting in unsafe behaviors including road boundary violations. Orthogonally, we propose a new objective, unlikelihood training, which forces predicted trajectories that conflict with contextual information to be assigned a lower probability. We demonstrate that our method can improve state-of-art modelsâ performance on challenging real-world trajectory forecasting datasets (nuScenes and Argoverse) by avoiding up to 56% context-violated prediction and improving up to 9% prediction accuracy.

The proposed shape registration method achieves three major advantages through combining equivariant feature learning with implicit shape models. First, the necessity of data association is removed because of the permutation-invariant property in network architectures similar to PointNet. Second, the registration in feature space can be solved in closed-form using Horn's method due to the SO(3)-equivariance property. Third, the registration is robust to noise in the point cloud because of the joint training of registration and implicit shape reconstruction. The experimental results show superior performance compared with existing correspondence-free deep registration methods.},
