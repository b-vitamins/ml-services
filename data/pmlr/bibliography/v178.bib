 abstract = {It is currently known how to characterize functions that neural networks can learn with SGD for two extremal parameterizations: neural networks in the linear regime, and neural networks with no structural constraints. However, for the main parametrization of interest (non-linear but regular networks) no tight characterization has yet been achieved, despite significant developments. We take a step in this direction by considering depth-2 neural networks trained by SGD in the mean-field regime. We consider functions on binary inputs that depend on a latent low-dimensional subspace (i.e., small number of coordinates). This regime is of interest since it is poorly understood how neural networks routinely tackle high-dimensional datasets and adapt to latent low-dimensional structure without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Accordingly, we study SGD-learnability with $O(d)$ sample complexity in a large ambient dimension $d$. Our main results characterize a hierarchical property, the "merged-staircase property", that is both necessary and nearly sufficient for learning in this setting. We further show that non-linear training is necessary: for this class of functions, linear methods on any feature map (e.g., the NTK) are not capable of learning efficiently. The key tools are a new "dimension-free" dynamics approximation result that applies to functions defined on a latent space of low-dimension, a proof of global convergence based on polynomial identity testing, and an improvement of lower bounds against linear methods for non-almost orthogonal functions.},

After showing the deficiencies of canonical estimators, we design a computationally-efficient spectral algorithm which estimates $p$ up to accuracy $\tilde O(\sqrt{p(1-p)}/n + \gamma\sqrt{p(1-p)} /\sqrt{n}+ \gamma/n)$ for $\gamma < 1/60$. Furthermore, we give an inefficient algorithm with similar accuracy for all $\gamma <1/2$, the information-theoretic limit.

 abstract = {We study high-dimensional sparse estimation under three natural constraints: communication constraints, local privacy constraints, and linear measurements (compressive sensing). Without sparsity assumptions, it has been established that interactivity cannot improve the minimax rates of estimation under these information constraints. The question of whether interactivity helps with natural inference tasks has been a topic of active research. We settle this question in the affirmative for the prototypical problems of high-dimensional sparse mean estimation and compressive sensing, by demonstrating a gap between interactive and noninteractive protocols. We further establish that the gap increases when we have more structured sparsity: for block sparsity this gap can be as large as polynomial in the dimensionality. Thus, the more structured the sparsity is, the greater is the advantage of interaction. Proving the lower bounds requires a careful breaking of a sum of correlated random variables into independent components using Baranyai's theorem on decomposition of hypergraphs, which might be of independent interest.},

 abstract = {The stochastic $K$-armed bandit problem has been studied extensively due to its applications in various domains ranging from online advertising to clinical trials. In practice however, the number of arms can be very large resulting in large memory requirements for simultaneously processing them. In this paper we consider a streaming setting where the arms are presented in a stream and the algorithm uses limited memory to process these arms. Here, the goal is not only to minimize regret, but also to do so in minimal memory. Previous algorithms for this problem operate in one of the two settings: they either use $\Omega(\log \log T)$ passes over the stream (Rathod, 2021; Chaudhuri and Kalyanakrishnan, 2020; Liau et al., 2018), or just a single pass (Maiti et al., 2021). In this paper we study the trade-off between memory and regret when $B$ passes over the stream are allowed, for any $B \geq 1$, and establish tight regret upper and lower bounds for any $B$-pass algorithm. Our results uncover a surprising *sharp transition phenomenon*: $O(1)$ memory is sufficient to achieve $\widetilde\Theta\Big(T^{\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2^{B+2}-2}}\Big)$ regret in $B$ passes, and increasing the memory to any quantity that is $o(K)$ has almost no impact on further reducing this regret, unless we use $\Omega(K)$ memory. Our main technical contribution is our lower bound which requires the use of information-theoretic techniques as well as ideas from round elimination to show that the *residual problem* remains challenging over subsequent passes.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we consider learning scenarios where the learned model is evaluated under an unknown test distribution which potentially differs from the training distribution (i.e. distribution shift). The learner has access to a family of weight functions such that the test distribution is a reweighting of the training distribution under one of these functions, a setting typically studied under the name of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO). We consider the problem of deriving regret bounds in the classical learning theory setting, and require that the resulting regret bounds hold uniformly for all potential test distributions. We show that the DRO formulation does not guarantee uniformly small regret under distribution shift. We instead propose an alternative method called Minimax Regret Optimization (MRO), and show that under suitable conditions this method achieves uniformly low regret across all test distributions. We also adapt our technique to have stronger guarantees when the test distributions are heterogeneous in their similarity to the training data. Given the widespead optimization of worst case risks in current approaches to robust machine learning, we believe that MRO can be a strong alternative to address distribution shift scenarios.},

 abstract = {Provably sample-efficient Reinforcement Learning (RL) with rich observations and function approximation has witnessed tremendous recent progress, particularly when the underlying function approximators are linear. In this linear regime, computationally and statistically efficient methods exist where the potentially infinite state and action spaces can be captured through a known feature embedding, with the sample complexity scaling with the (intrinsic) dimension of these features. When the action space is finite, significantly more sophisticated results allow non-linear function approximation under appropriate structural constraints on the underlying RL problem, permitting for instance, the learning of good features instead of assuming access to them. In this work, we present the first result for non-linear function approximation which holds for general action spaces under a linear embeddability condition, which generalizes all linear and finite action settings. We design a novel optimistic posterior sampling strategy, TS^3 for such problems, and show worst case sample complexity guarantees that scale with a rank parameter of the RL problem, the linear embedding dimension introduced in this work and standard measures of the function class complexity.},

 abstract = {We show a connection between sampling and optimization on discrete domains. For a family of distributions $μ$ defined on size $k$ subsets of a ground set of elements that is closed under external fields, we show that rapid mixing of natural local random walks implies the existence of simple approximation algorithms to find $\max μ(\cdot)$. More precisely we show that if (multi-step) down-up random walks have spectral gap at least inverse polynomially large in $k$, then (multi-step) local search can find $\max μ(\cdot)$ within a factor of $k^{O(k)}$. As the main application of our result, we show a simple nearly-optimal $k^{O(k)}$-factor approximation algorithm for MAP inference on nonsymmetric DPPs. This is the first nontrivial multiplicative approximation for finding the largest size $k$ principal minor of a square (not-necessarily-symmetric) matrix $L$ with $L+L^\intercal\succeq 0$. We establish the connection between sampling and optimization by showing that an exchange inequality, a concept rooted in discrete convex analysis, can be derived from fast mixing of local random walks. We further connect exchange inequalities with composable core-sets for optimization, generalizing recent results on composable core-sets for DPP maximization to arbitrary distributions that satisfy either the strongly Rayleigh property or that have a log-concave generating polynomial.},

 abstract = {The Hierarchical Clustering (HC) problem consists of building a hierarchy of clusters to represent a given dataset. Motivated by the modern large-scale applications, we study the problem in the \streaming model, in which the memory is heavily limited and only a single or very few passes over the input are allowed. Specifically, we investigate whether a good hierarchical clustering can be obtained, or at least whether we can approximately estimate the value of the optimal hierarchy. To measure the quality of a hierarchy, we use the HC minimization objective introduced by Dasgupta. Assuming that the input is an $n$-vertex weighted graph whose edges arrive in a stream, we derive the following results on space-vs-accuracy tradeoffs: * With $O(n\cdot \text{polylog}\,{n})$ space, we develop a single-pass algorithm, whose approximation ratio matches the currently best offline algorithm. * When the space is more limited, namely, $n^{1-o(1)}$, we prove that no algorithm can even estimate the value of optimum HC tree to within an $o(\frac{\log{n}}{\log\log{n}})$ factor, even when allowed $\text{polylog}{\,{n}}$ passes over the input. * In the most stringent setting of $\text{polylog}\,{n}$ space, we rule out algorithms that can even distinguish between "highly"-vs-"poorly" clusterable graphs, namely, graphs that have an $n^{1/2-o(1)}$ factor gap between their HC objective value. * Finally, we prove that any single-pass streaming algorithm that computes an optimal HC tree requires to store almost the entire input even if allowed exponential time. Our algorithmic results establish a general structural result that proves that cut sparsifiers of input graph can preserve cost of "balanced" HC trees to within a constant factor. Our lower bound results include a new streaming lower bound for a novel problem "One-vs-Many-Expanders", which can be of independent interest.},

Using this reduction we obtain a (nearly) optimal algorithm for smooth optimization with convergence rate $\widetilde{O}(1/T^2)$ and uniform stability $O(T^2/n)$, resolving an open problem of Chen et al.

 abstract = {Data poisoning attacks, in which an adversary corrupts a training set with the goal of inducing specific desired mistakes, have raised substantial concern: even just the possibility of such an attack can make a user no longer trust the results of a learning system. In this work, we show how to achieve strong robustness guarantees in the face of such attacks across multiple axes. We provide robustly-reliable predictions, in which the predicted label is guaranteed to be correct so long as the adversary has not exceeded a given corruption budget, even in the presence of instance targeted attacks, where the adversary knows the test example in advance and aims to cause a specific failure on that example. Our guarantees are substantially stronger than those in prior approaches, which were only able to provide certificates that the prediction of the learning algorithm does not change, as opposed to certifying that the prediction is correct, as we are able to achieve in our work. Remarkably, we provide a complete characterization of learnability in this setting, in particular, nearly-tight matching upper and lower bounds on the region that can be certified, as well as efficient algorithms for computing this region given an ERM oracle. Moreover, for the case of linear separators over logconcave distributions, we provide efficient truly polynomial time algorithms (i.e., non-oracle algorithms) for such robustly-reliable predictions. We also extend these results to the active setting where the algorithm adaptively asks for labels of specific informative examples, and the difficulty is that the adversary might even be adaptive to this interaction, as well as to the agnostic learning setting where there is no perfect classifier even over the uncorrupted data.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of learning a hypergraph via edge detecting queries. In this problem, a learner queries subsets of vertices of a hidden hypergraph and observes whether these subsets contain an edge or not. In general, learning a hypergraph with $m$ edges of maximum size $d$ requires $\Omega((2m/d)^{d/2})$ queries. In this paper, we aim to identify families of hypergraphs that can be learned without suffering from a query complexity that grows exponentially in the size of the edges. We show that hypermatchings and low-degree near-uniform hypergraphs with $n$ vertices are learnable with poly$(n)$ queries. For learning hypermatchings (hypergraphs of maximum degree $ 1$), we give an $O(\log^3 n)$-round algorithm with $O(n \log^5 n)$ queries. We complement this upper bound by showing that there are no algorithms with poly$(n)$ queries that learn hypermatchings in $o(\log \log n)$ adaptive rounds. For hypergraphs with maximum degree $\Delta$ and edge size ratio $\rho$, we give a non-adaptive algorithm with $O((2n)^{\rho \Delta+1}\log^2 n)$ queries. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first algorithms with poly$(n, m)$ query complexity for learning non-trivial families of hypergraphs that have a super-constant number of edges of super-constant size.},

 abstract = {This paper studies M-estimators with gradient-Lipschitz loss function regularized with convex penalty in linear models with Gaussian design matrix and arbitrary noise distribution. A practical example is the robust M-estimator constructed with the Huber loss and the Elastic-Net penalty and the noise distribution has heavy-tails. Our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We provide general formulae for the derivatives of regularized M-estimators $\hatβ(y,X)$ where differentiation is taken with respect to both $y$ and $X$; this reveals a simple differentiability structure shared by all convex regularized M-estimators. (ii) Using these derivatives, we characterize the distribution of the residual $r_i = y_i-x_i^\top\hatβ$ in the intermediate high-dimensional regime where dimension and sample size are of the same order. (iii) Motivated by the distribution of the residuals, we propose a novel adaptive criterion to select tuning parameters of regularized M-estimators. The criterion approximates the out-of-sample error up to an additive constant independent of the estimator, so that minimizing the criterion provides a proxy for minimizing the out-of-sample error. The proposed adaptive criterion does not require the knowledge of the noise distribution or of the covariance of the design. Simulated data confirms the theoretical findings, regarding both the distribution of the residuals and the success of the criterion as a proxy of the out-of-sample error. Finally our results reveal new relationships between the derivatives of $\hatβ(y,X)$ and the effective degrees of freedom of the M-estimator, which are of independent interest.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of uniformity testing with limited memory. We observe a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables drawn from a distribution $p$ over $[n]$, which is either uniform or is $\varepsilon$-far from uniform under the total variation distance, and our goal is to determine the correct hypothesis. At each time point we are allowed to update the state of a finite-memory machine with $S$ states, where each state of the machine is assigned one of the hypotheses, and we are interested in obtaining an asymptotic probability of error at most $0<\delta<1/2$ uniformly under both hypotheses. The main contribution of this paper is deriving upper and lower bounds on the number of states $S$ needed in order to achieve a constant error probability $\delta$, as a function of $n$ and $\varepsilon$, where our upper bound is $O(\frac{n\log n}{\varepsilon})$ and our lower bound is $\Omega (n+\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Prior works in the field have almost exclusively used collision counting for upper bounds, and the Paninski mixture for lower bounds. Somewhat surprisingly, in the limited memory with unlimited samples setup, the optimal solution does not involve counting collisions, and the Paninski prior is not hard. Thus, different proof techniques are needed in order to attain our bounds.},

 abstract = {This paper studies an intriguing phenomenon related to the good generalization performance of estimators obtained by using large learning rates within gradient descent algorithms. First observed in the deep learning literature, we show that a phenomenon can be precisely characterized in the context of kernel methods, even though the resulting optimization problem is convex. Specifically, we consider the minimization of a quadratic objective in a separable Hilbert space, and show that with early stopping, the choice of learning rate influences the spectral decomposition of the obtained solution on the Hessian's eigenvectors. This extends an intuition described by Nakkiran (2020) on a two-dimensional toy problem to realistic learning scenarios such as kernel ridge regression. While large learning rates may be proven beneficial as soon as there is a mismatch between the train and test objectives, we further explain why it already occurs in classification tasks without assuming any particular mismatch between train and test data distributions.},

The definitions of these adversaries specify the type of allowable corruptions (noise model) as well as when these corruptions can be made (adaptivity); the latter differentiates between oblivious adversaries that can only corrupt the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ and adaptive adversaries that can have their corruptions depend on the specific sample $S$ that is drawn from $\mathcal{D}$. In this work, we investigate whether oblivious adversaries are effectively equivalent to adaptive adversaries, across all noise models studied in the literature. Specifically, can the behavior of an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ in the presence of oblivious adversaries always be well-approximated by that of an algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ in the presence of adaptive adversaries? Our first result shows that this is indeed the case for the broad class of statistical query algorithms, under all reasonable noise models. We then show that in the specific case of additive noise, this equivalence holds for all algorithms. Finally, we map out an approach towards proving this statement in its fullest generality, for all algorithms and under all reasonable noise models.},

 abstract = {We study universal consistency of non-i.i.d. processes in the context of online learning. A stochastic process is said to admit universal consistency if there exists a learner that achieves vanishing average loss for any measurable response function on this process. When the loss function is unbounded, Blanchard et al. showed that the only processes admitting strong universal consistency are those taking a finite number of values almost surely. However, when the loss function is bounded, the class of processes admitting strong universal consistency is much richer and its characterization could be dependent on the response setting (Hanneke). In this paper, we show that this class of processes is independent from the response setting thereby closing an open question (Hanneke, Open Problem 3). Specifically, we show that the class of processes that admit universal online learning is the same for binary classification as for multiclass classification with countable number of classes. Consequently, any output setting with bounded loss can be reduced to binary classification. Our reduction is constructive and practical. Indeed, we show that the nearest neighbor algorithm is transported by our construction. For binary classification on a process admitting strong universal learning, we prove that nearest neighbor successfully learns at least all finite unions of intervals.},

We are interested in characterizing processes for which learning is possible and whether there exist learning rules guaranteed to be universally consistent given the only assumption that such learning is possible. The case of unbounded losses is very restrictive, since the learnable processes almost surely visit a finite number of points and as a result, simple memorization is optimistically universal. We focus on the bounded setting and give a complete characterization of the processes admitting strong and weak universal learning. We further show that k-nearest neighbor algorithm (kNN) is not optimistically universal and present a novel variant of 1NN which is optimistically universal for general input and value spaces in both strong and weak setting.

 abstract = {Much of modern learning theory has been split between two regimes: the classical offline setting, where data arrive independently, and the online setting, where data arrive adversarially. While the former model is often both computationally and statistically tractable, the latter requires no distributional assumptions. In an attempt to achieve the best of both worlds, previous work proposed the smooth online setting where each sample is drawn from an adversarially chosen distribution, which is smooth, i.e., it has a bounded density with respect to a fixed dominating measure. We provide tight bounds on the minimax regret of learning a nonparametric function class, with nearly optimal dependence on both the horizon and smoothness parameters. Furthermore, we provide the first oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithms in this setting. In particular, we propose an oracle-efficient improper algorithm whose regret achieves optimal dependence on the horizon and a proper algorithm requiring only a single oracle call per round whose regret has the optimal horizon dependence in the classification setting and is sublinear in general. Both algorithms have exponentially worse dependence on the smoothness parameter of the adversary than the minimax rate. We then prove a lower bound on the oracle complexity of any proper learning algorithm, which matches the oracle-efficient upper bounds up to a polynomial factor, thus demonstrating the existence of a statistical-computational gap in smooth online learning. Finally, we apply our results to the contextual bandit setting to show that if a function class is learnable in the classical setting, then there is an oracle-efficient, no-regret algorithm for contextual bandits in the case that contexts arrive in a smooth manner.},

 abstract = {The amount of training-data is one of the key factors which determines  the generalization capacity of learning algorithms.  Intuitively, one expects the error rate to decrease  as the amount of training-data increases. Perhaps surprisingly, natural attempts to formalize this intuition give rise to  interesting and challenging mathematical questions.  For example, in their classical book on pattern recognition,  Devroye, Gyorfi and Lugosi (1996) ask whether there exists a {monotone} Bayes-consistent algorithm.This question remained open for over 25 years,  until recently Pestov (2021) resolved it for binary classification, using an intricate construction of a monotone Bayes-consistent algorithm. We derive a general result in multiclass classification, showing that  every learning algorithm $A$ can be transformed to a monotone one with similar performance. Further, the transformation is efficient and only uses a black-box oracle access to $A$. This demonstrates that one can provably avoid non-monotonic behaviour without compromising performance, thus answering questions asked by Devroye, Gyorfi, and Lugosi  (1996), Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019), Viering and Loog (2021), and by Mhammedi (2021). Our general transformation readily implies monotone learners in a variety of contexts: for example, Pestovâs result follows by applying it on \emph{any}  Bayes-consistent algorithm (e.g., $k$-Nearest-Neighbours). In fact, our transformation extends Pestovâs result  to classification tasks with an arbitrary number of labels.  This is contrast with Pestovâs work which is tailored to binary classification.  In addition, we provide uniform bounds on the error of the monotone algorithm. This makes our transformation applicable in distribution-free settings. For example, in PAC learning it implies that every learnable class admits a monotone PAC learner. This resolves questions asked  by Viering, Mey, and Loog (2019); Viering and Loog (2021); Mhammedi (2021)},

 abstract = {We consider the query complexity of finding a local minimum of a function defined on a graph, where at most $k$ rounds of interaction with the oracle are allowed. Rounds model parallel settings, where each query takes resources to complete and is executed on a separate processor. Thus the query complexity in $k$ rounds informs how many processors are needed to achieve a parallel time of $k$. We focus on the d-dimensional grid $[n]^d$, where the dimension $d$ is a constant, and consider two regimes for the number of rounds: constant and polynomial in n. We give algorithms and lower bounds that characterize the trade-off between the number of rounds of adaptivity and the query complexity of local search. When the number of rounds $k$ is constant, we show that the query complexity of local search in $k$ rounds is $\Theta\bigl(n^{\frac{d^{k+1} - d^k}{d^k - 1}}\bigl)$, for both deterministic and randomized algorithms. When the number of rounds is polynomial, i.e. $k = n^{\alpha}$ for $0 < \alpha < d/2$, the randomized query complexity is $\Theta\left(n^{d-1 - \frac{d-2}{d}\alpha}\right)$ for all $d \geq 5$. For $d=3$ and $d=4$, we show the same upper bound expression holds and give almost matching lower bounds. The local search analysis also enables us to characterize the query complexity of computing a Brouwer fixed point in rounds. Our proof technique for lower bounding the query complexity in rounds may be of independent interest as an alternative to the classical relational adversary method of Aaronson from the fully adaptive setting.},

In a setting where examples lie in $\{0,1\}^d$ and the optimal classifier can be encoded using $\kappa$ bits, we show that algorithms which learn using a near-minimal number of examples, $\tilde O(\kappa)$, must use $\tilde \Omega( d\kappa)$ bits of space. Our space bounds match the dimension of the ambient space of the problem's natural parametrization, even when it is quadratic in the size of examples and the final classifier. For instance, in the setting of $d$-sparse linear classifiers over degree-2 polynomial features, for which $\kappa=\Theta(d\log d)$, our space lower bound is $\tilde\Omega(d^2)$. Our bounds degrade gracefully with the stream length $N$, generally having the form $\tilde\Omega\left(d\kappa \cdot \frac{\kappa}{N}\right)$. Bounds of the form $\Omega(d\kappa)$ were known for learning parity and other problems defined over finite fields. Bounds that apply in a narrow range of sample sizes are also known for linear regression. Ours are the first such bounds for problems of the type commonly seen in recent learning applications that apply for a large range of input sizes.},

That is, given samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\{1, \dots, n\}$, is it $\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution $q$ (in total variation distance)? Despite significant interest over the past decade, this problem is well understood only in the extreme cases. In the noiseless setting (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 = 0$) the sample complexity is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain size. At the other end of the spectrum, when $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2/2$, the sample complexity jumps to the barely sublinear $\Theta(n/\log n)$. However, very little is known about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price of tolerance in distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$, up to a single $\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be \[\tilde \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\varepsilon_2^{2}} + \frac{n}{\log n} \cdot \max \left\{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2},\left(\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2}\right)^{\!\!2}\right\}\right),\] providing a smooth tradeoff between the two previously known cases. We also provide a similar characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence testing, where both $p$ and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the main quantity dictating the sample complexity is the ratio $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more intuitive $\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our lower bound framework, which involves novel approximation-theoretic tools required to handle the asymmetry between $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, a challenge absent from previous works.},

In this work, we initiate the study of policy optimization for the stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem, a goal-oriented reinforcement learning model that strictly generalizes the finite-horizon model and better captures many applications. We consider a wide range of settings, including stochastic and adversarial environments under full information or bandit feedback, and propose a policy optimization algorithm for each setting that makes use of novel correction terms and/or variants of dilated bonuses (Luo et al., 2021). For most settings, our algorithm is shown to achieve a near-optimal regret bound. One key technical contribution of this work is a new approximation scheme to tackle SSP problems that we call \textit{stacked discounted approximation} and use in all our proposed algorithms. Unlike the finite-horizon approximation that is heavily used in recent SSP algorithms, our new approximation enables us to learn a near-stationary policy with only logarithmic changes during an episode and could lead to an exponential improvement in space complexity.},

 abstract = {We revisit the basic problem of quantum state certification: given copies of unknown mixed state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$ and the description of a mixed state $\sigma$, decide whether $\sigma = \rho$ or $\|\sigma - \rho\|_{\mathsf{tr}} \ge \epsilon$. When $\sigma$ is maximally mixed, this is mixedness testing, and it is known that $\Omega(d^{\Theta(1)}/\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary, where the exact exponent depends on the type of measurements the learner can make [OW15, BCL20], and in many of these settings there is a matching upper bound [OW15, BOW19, BCL20]. Can one avoid this $d^{\Theta(1)}$ dependence for certain kinds of mixed states $\sigma$, e.g. ones which are approximately low rank? More ambitiously, does there exist a simple functional $f:\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}\to\mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ for which one can show that $\Theta(f(\sigma)/\epsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for state certification with respect to any $\sigma$? Such instance-optimal bounds are known in the context of classical distribution testing, e.g. [VV17]. Here we give the first bounds of this nature for the quantum setting, showing (up to log factors) that the copy complexity for state certification using nonadaptive incoherent measurements is essentially given by the copy complexity for mixedness testing times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. Surprisingly, our bound differs substantially from instance optimal bounds for the classical problem, demonstrating a qualitative difference between the two settings.},

Recent work [dLN+21, dNS21] has introduced efficient algorithms for consistent recovery of the parameter vector. These algorithms crucially rely on the design matrix being well-spread (a matrix is well-spread if its column span is far from any sparse vector). In this paper, we show that there exists a family of design matrices lacking well-spreadness such that consistent recovery of the parameter vector in the above robust linear regression model is information-theoretically impossible. We further investigate the average-case time complexity of certifying well-spreadness of random matrices. We show that it is possible to efficiently certify whether a given $n$-by-$d$ Gaussian matrix is well-spread if the number of observations is quadratic in the ambient dimension. We complement this result by showing rigorous evidence -- in the form of a lower bound against low-degree polynomials -- of the computational hardness of this same certification problem when the number of observations is $o(d^2)$.},

In particular, we consider simple overparameterized linear regression $y = X \theta + w$ with random design $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d}$ under the proportional asymptotics $d/n \to \gamma \in (1, \infty)$. We precisely characterize how prediction (test) error necessarily scales with training error in this setting. An implication of this characterization is that as the label noise variance $\sigma^2 \to 0$, any estimator that incurs at least $\mathsf{c}\sigma^4$ training error for some constant $\mathsf{c}$ is necessarily suboptimal and will suffer growth in excess prediction error at least linear in the training error. Thus, optimal performance requires fitting training data to substantially higher accuracy than the inherent noise floor of the problem.},

The decision-maker seeks cost comparable to the advice when it performs well, known as $\textit{consistency}$, while also ensuring worst-case $\textit{robustness}$ even when the advice is adversarial. We first consider the common paradigm of algorithms that switch between the decisions of the advice and a competitive algorithm, showing that no algorithm in this class can improve upon 3-consistency while staying robust. We then propose two novel algorithms that bypass this limitation by exploiting the problem's convexity. The first, INTERP, achieves $(\sqrt{2}+\epsilon)$-consistency and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{C}{\epsilon^2})$-robustness for any $\epsilon > 0$, where $C$ is the competitive ratio of an algorithm for convex function chasing or a subclass thereof. The second, BDINTERP, achieves $(1+\epsilon)$-consistency and $\mathcal{O}(\frac{CD}{\epsilon})$-robustness when the problem has bounded diameter $D$. Further, we show that BDINTERP achieves near-optimal consistency-robustness trade-off for the special case where cost functions are $\alpha$-polyhedral.},

By developing a general theoretical framework, we establish a duality between generalisation bounds based on the regularity of the loss function, and their chained counterparts, which can be obtained by lifting the regularity assumption from the loss onto its gradient. This allows us to re-derive the chaining mutual information bound from the literature, and to obtain novel chained information-theoretic generalisation bounds, based on the Wasserstein distance and other probability metrics. We show on some toy examples that the chained generalisation bound can be significantly tighter than its standard counterpart, particularly when the distribution of the hypotheses selected by the algorithm is very concentrated.

 abstract = {We consider the problem of recovering communities in a random directed graph with planted communities. To model real-world directed graphs such as the Twitter or Instagram graphs that exhibit very heterogeneous degree sequences, we introduce the Degree-Heterogeneous Stochastic Block Model (DHSBM), a generalization of the classic Stochastic Block Model (SBM), where the vertex set is partitioned into communities and each vertex $u$ has two (unknown) associated probabilities, $p_u$ and $q_u$, $p_u  > q_u$. An arc from $u$ to $v$ is generated with probability $p_u$ if $u$ and $v$ are in the same community and with probability $q_u$ otherwise.  Given a graph generated from this model, the goal is to retrieve the communities. The DHSBM allows to generate graphs with planted communities while allowing heterogeneous degree distributions, a quite important feature of real-world networks.  In the case where there are two communities, we present an iterative greedy linear-time algorithm that recovers them whenever $\min_u \frac{p_u - q_u}{\sqrt{p_u}} = \Omega(\sqrt{\log (n)/n})$. We also show that, up to a constant, this condition is necessary. Our results also extend to the standard (undirected) SBM, where $p_u = p$ and $q_u= q$ for all nodes $u$. Our algorithm presents the first linear-time algorithm that recovers exactly the communities at the asymptotic information-theoretic threshold, improving over previous near-linear time spectral approaches.},

We consider two different simple random procedures for assigning individuals to tests: the constant-column design and Bernoulli design. Our first set of results concerns the fundamental statistical limits. For the constant-column design, we give a new information-theoretic lower bound which implies that the proportion of correctly identifiable infected individuals undergoes a sharp "all-or-nothing" phase transition when the number of tests crosses a particular threshold. For the Bernoulli design, we determine the precise number of tests required to solve the associated detection problem (where the goal is to distinguish between a group testing instance and pure noise), improving both the upper and lower bounds of Truong, Aldridge, and Scarlett (2020). For both group testing models, we also study the power of computationally efficient (polynomial-time) inference procedures. We determine the precise number of tests required for the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms to solve the detection problem. This provides evidence for an inherent computational-statistical gap in both the detection and recovery problems at small sparsity levels. Notably, our evidence is contrary to that of Iliopoulos and Zadik (2021), who predicted the absence of a computational-statistical gap in the Bernoulli design.},

We show that acceleration remains unachievable for any deterministic algorithm which receives exact gradient and function-value information (unbounded queries, no noise).

This cements a surprising gap between the complexity of convex optimization and geodesically convex optimization: for hyperbolic spaces, Riemannian gradient descent is optimal on the class of smooth and and strongly geodesically convex functions, in the regime where the condition number scales with the radius of the optimization domain.

 abstract = {An assembly is a large population of neurons whose synchronous firing is hypothesized to represent a memory, concept, word, and other cognitive categories. Assemblies are believed to provide a bridge between high-level cognitive phenomena and low-level neural activity. Recently, a computational system called the Assembly Calculus (AC), with a repertoire of biologically plausible operations on assemblies, has been shown capable of simulating arbitrary space-bounded computation, but also of simulating complex cognitive phenomena such as language, reasoning, and planning. However, the mechanism whereby assemblies can mediate learning has not been known. Here we present such a mechanism, and prove rigorously that, for simple classification problems defined on distributions of labeled assemblies, a new assembly representing each class can be reliably formed in response to a few stimuli from the class; this assembly is henceforth reliably recalled in response to new stimuli from the same class. Furthermore, such class assemblies will be distinguishable as long as the respective classes are reasonably separated -- for example, when they are clusters of similar assemblies. To prove these results, we draw on random graph theory with dynamic edge weights to estimate sequences of activated vertices, yielding strong generalizations of previous calculations and theorems in this field over the past five years. These theorems are backed up by experiments demonstrating the successful formation of assemblies which represent concept classes on synthetic data drawn from such distributions, and also on MNIST, which lends itself to classification through one assembly per digit. Seen as a learning algorithm, this mechanism is entirely online, generalizes from very few samples, and requires only mild supervision -- all key attributes of learning in a model of the brain.},

In this work, we explain this gap by demonstrating that there is a large class of functions which cannot be efficiently learned by kernel methods but can be easily learned with gradient descent on a two layer neural network outside the kernel regime by learning representations that are relevant to the target task. We also demonstrate that these representations allow for efficient transfer learning, which is impossible in the kernel regime. Specifically, we consider the problem of learning polynomials which depend on only a few relevant directions, i.e. of the form $f^\star(x) = g(Ux)$ where $U: \R^d \to \R^r$ with $d \gg r$. When the degree of $f^\star$ is $p$, it is known that $n \asymp d^p$ samples are necessary to learn $f^\star$ in the kernel regime. Our primary result is that gradient descent learns a representation of the data which depends only on the directions relevant to $f^\star$. This results in an improved sample complexity of $n\asymp d^2 r + dr^p$. Furthermore, in a transfer learning setup where the data distributions in the source and target domain share the same representation $U$ but have different polynomial heads we show that a popular heuristic for transfer learning has a target sample complexity independent of $d$.},

In particular, we show that no efficient SQ algorithm with access to an $\epsilon$-corrupted binary product distribution can learn its mean within $\ell_2$-error $o(\epsilon \sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$. Similarly, we show that no efficient SQ algorithm with access to an $\epsilon$-corrupted ferromagnetic high-temperature Ising model can learn the model to total variation distance $o(\epsilon \log(1/\epsilon))$. Our SQ lower bounds match the error guarantees of known algorithms for these problems, providing evidence that current upper bounds for these tasks are best possible. At the technical level, we develop a generic SQ lower bound for discrete high-dimensional distributions starting from low dimensional moment matching constructions that we believe will find other applications.

Given labeled samples $(x, y)$ from a distribution $D$ on $\mathbb{R}^{d} \times \{ \pm 1\}$ such that the marginal $D_x$ on the examples is arbitrary and the label $y$ of example $x$ is generated from the target halfspace corrupted by a Massart adversary with flipping probability $\eta(x) \leq \eta \leq 1/2$, the goal is to compute a hypothesis with small misclassification error. The best known $\mathrm{poly}(d, 1/\epsilon)$-time algorithms for this problem achieve error of $\eta+\epsilon$, which can be far from the optimal bound of $\mathrm{OPT}+\epsilon$, where $\mathrm{OPT} = \mathbf{E}_{x \sim D_x} [\eta(x)]$. While it is known that achieving $\mathrm{OPT}+o(1)$ error requires super-polynomial time in the Statistical Query model, a large gap remains between known upper and lower bounds. In this work, we essentially characterize the efficient learnability of Massart halfspaces in the Statistical Query (SQ) model. Specifically, we show that no efficient SQ algorithm for learning Massart halfspaces on $\mathbb{R}^d$ can achieve error better than $\Omega(\eta)$, even if $\mathrm{OPT} = 2^{-\log^{c} (d)}$, for any universal constant $c \in (0, 1)$. Furthermore, when the noise upper bound $\eta$ is close to $1/2$, our error lower bound becomes $\eta - o_{\eta}(1)$, where the $o_{\eta}(1)$ term goes to $0$ when $\eta$ approaches $1/2$. Our results provide strong evidence that known learning algorithms for Massart halfspaces are nearly best possible, thereby resolving a longstanding open problem in learning theory.},

Specifically, we are given labeled examples from a distribution $D$ on $(\mathbf{x}, y)\in\mathbb{R}^d \times \mathbb{R}$ such that there exists $\mathbf{w}^\ast\in\mathbb{R}^d$ achieving $F(\mathbf{w}^\ast)=\epsilon$, where $F(\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}[(\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})-y)^2]$. The goal of the learner is to output a hypothesis vector $\mathbf{w}$ such that $F(\mathbb{w})=C\, \epsilon$ with high probability, where $C>1$ is a universal constant. As our main contribution, we give efficient constant-factor approximate learners for a broad class of distributions (including log-concave distributions) and activation functions. Concretely, for the class of isotropic log-concave distributions, we obtain the following important corollaries: For the logistic activation, we obtain the first polynomial-time constant factor approximation (even under the Gaussian distribution). Our algorithm has sample complexity $\widetilde{O}(d/\epsilon)$, which is tight within polylogarithmic factors. For the ReLU activation, we give an efficient algorithm with sample complexity $\tilde{O}(d\, \polylog(1/\epsilon))$. Prior to our work, the best known constant-factor approximate learner had sample complexity $\tilde{\Omega}(d/\epsilon)$. In both of these settings, our algorithms are simple, performing gradient-descent on the (regularized) $L_2^2$-loss. The correctness of our algorithms relies on novel structural results that we establish, showing that (essentially all) stationary points of the underlying non-convex loss are approximately optimal.},

The latter result does not apply when the distribution $A$ is discrete. A natural question is whether information-computation tradeoffs persist in this setting.

Learning from high-dimensional observations has been the subject of extensive investigation in supervised learning and statistics (e.g., via sparsity), but analogous issues in reinforcement learning are not well understood, even in finite state/action (tabular) domains. We introduce a new problem setting for reinforcement learning, the Exogenous Markov Decision Process (ExoMDP), in which the state space admits an (unknown) factorization into a small controllable (or, endogenous) component and a large irrelevant (or, exogenous) component; the exogenous component is independent of the learner's actions, but evolves in an arbitrary, temporally correlated fashion. We provide a new algorithm, ExoRL, which learns a near-optimal policy with sample complexity polynomial in the size of the endogenous component and nearly independent of the size of the exogenous component, thereby offering a doubly-exponential improvement over off-the-shelf algorithms. Our results highlight for the first time that sample-efficient reinforcement learning is possible in the presence of exogenous information, and provide a simple, user-friendly benchmark for investigation going forward.},

We establish connections between continual learning in the linear setting and two other research areas: alternating projections and the Kaczmarz method. In specific settings, we highlight differences between forgetting and convergence to the offline solution as studied in those areas. In particular, when T tasks in d dimensions are presented cyclically for k iterations, we prove an upper bound of T^2 * min{1/sqrt(k), d/k} on the forgetting. This stands in contrast to the convergence to the offline solution, which can be arbitrarily slow according to existing alternating projection results.

 abstract = {We consider the offline reinforcement learning problem, where the aim is to learn a decision making policy from logged data. Offline RL -- particularly when coupled with (value) function approximation to allow for generalization in large or continuous state spaces -- is becoming increasingly relevant in practice, because it avoids costly and time-consuming online data collection and is well suited to safety-critical domains. Existing sample complexity guarantees for offline value function approximation methods typically require both (1) distributional assumptions (i.e., good coverage) and (2) representational assumptions (i.e., ability to represent some or all $Q$-value functions) stronger than what is required for supervised learning. However, the necessity of these conditions and the fundamental limits of offline RL are not well understood in spite of decades of research. This led Chen and Jiang (2019) to conjecture that concentrability (the most standard notion of coverage) and realizability (the weakest representation condition) alone are not sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL. We resolve this conjecture in the positive by proving that in general, even if both concentrability and realizability are satisfied, any algorithm requires sample complexity polynomial in the size of the state space to learn a non-trivial policy. Our results show that sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning requires either restrictive coverage conditions or representation conditions that go beyond supervised learning, and highlight a phenomenon called over-coverage which serves as a fundamental barrier for offline value function approximation methods. A consequence of our results for reinforcement learning with linear function approximation is that the separation between online and offline RL can be arbitrarily large, even in constant dimension.},

We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error, perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax optimal test error.

Traditionally, a central controller schedules agent requests with full knowledge of system parameters. However, emerging applications require decentralized operation without this central coordination or complete system information. This presents challenges as agents lack the global knowledge needed to efficiently route jobs. Recent research into efficient decentralized learning algorithms for such systems faces limitations in nonoptimal throughput, demanding computations, or degrading efficiency with exponential queue growth. In contrast, this paper introduces an algorithm that enables queues to efficiently learn decentralized scheduling policies while ensuring throughput optimality. The approach is computationally lightweight, achieving queue length bounds that scale polynomially rather than exponentially in system size. Experiments demonstrate faster convergence and robustness of our algorithm compared with prior decentralized algorithms.},

In this paper we study the classic k-means clustering problem in the presence of noisy labels.  In this problem, in addition to a set of points and parameter \(k\), we receive cluster labels of each point generated by either an adversarial or a random perturbation of the optimal solution. Our main goal is to formally study the effect of this extra information on the complexity of the k-means problem. In particular, in the context of random perturbations, we give an efficient algorithm that finds a clustering of cost within a factor $1+o(1)$ of the optimum even when the label of each point is perturbed with a large probability (think 99%). In contrast, we show that the side-information with adversarial perturbations is as hard as the original problem even if only a small $\epsilon$ fraction of the labels are  perturbed. We complement this negative result by giving a simple algorithm in the case when the adversary is only allowed to perturb an $\epsilon$ fraction of the labels per \emph{each cluster}.},

While most state-of-the-art projection-free algorithms are based on the \textit{follow-the-leader} framework, our algorithms are fundamentally different and are based on the \textit{online gradient descent} algorithm with a novel and efficient approach to computing so-called \textit{infeasible projections}. As a consequence, we obtain the first projection-free algorithms which naturally yield \textit{adaptive regret} guarantees, i.e., regret bounds that hold w.r.t. any sub-interval of the sequence. Concretely, when assuming the availability of a linear optimization oracle (LOO) for the feasible set, on a sequence of length $T$, our algorithms guarantee $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive regret and $O(T^{3/4})$ adaptive expected regret, for the full-information and bandit settings, respectively, using only $O(T)$ calls to the LOO. These bounds match the current state-of-the-art regret bounds for LOO-based projection-free OCO, which are \textit{not adaptive}.

 abstract = {We consider the problem of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks. We study edge-correlated stochastic block models with two balanced communities, focusing on the regime where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices. Our main result derives the precise information-theoretic threshold for exact community recovery using multiple correlated graphs. This threshold captures the interplay between the community recovery and graph matching tasks. In particular, we uncover and characterize a region of the parameter space where exact community recovery is possible using multiple correlated graphs, even though (1) this is information-theoretically impossible using a single graph and (2) exact graph matching is also information-theoretically impossible. In this regime, we develop a novel algorithm that carefully synthesizes algorithms from the community recovery and graph matching literatures.},

 abstract = {Despite rapid progress in theoretical reinforcement learning (RL) over the last few years, most of the known guarantees are worst-case in nature, failing to take advantage of structure that may be known a priori about a given RL problem at hand. In this paper we address the question of whether worst-case lower bounds for regret in online learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) can be circumvented when information about the MDP, in the form of predictions about its optimal $Q$-value function, is given to the algorithm. We show that when the predictions about the optimal $Q$-value function satisfy a reasonably weak condition we call distillation, then we can improve regret bounds by replacing the set of state-action pairs with the set of state-action pairs on which the predictions are grossly inaccurate. This improvement holds for both uniform regret bounds and gap-based ones. Further, we are able to achieve this property with an algorithm that achieves sublinear regret when given arbitrary predictions (i.e., even those which are not a distillation). Our work extends a recent line of work on algorithms with predictions, which has typically focused on simple online problems such as caching and scheduling, to the more complex and general problem of reinforcement learning.},

 abstract = {Introduced as a notion of algorithmic fairness, multicalibration has proved to be a powerful and versatile concept with implications far beyond its original intent. This stringent notion -- that predictions be well-calibrated across a rich class of intersecting subpopulations -- provides its strong guarantees at a cost: the computational and sample complexity of learning multicalibrated predictors are high, and grow exponentially with the number of class labels. In contrast, the relaxed notion of multiaccuracy can be achieved more efficiently, yet many of the most desirable properties of multicalibration cannot be guaranteed assuming multiaccuracy alone. This tension raises a key question: Can we learn predictors with multicalibration-style guarantees at a cost commensurate with multiaccuracy? In this work, we define and initiate the study of Low-Degree Multicalibration. Low-Degree Multicalibration defines a hierarchy of increasingly-powerful multi-group fairness notions that spans multiaccuracy and the original formulation of multicalibration at the extremes. Our main technical contribution demonstrates that key properties of multicalibration, related to fairness and accuracy, actually manifest as low-degree properties. Importantly, we show that low-degree multicalibration can be significantly more efficient than full multicalibration. In the multi-class setting, the sample complexity to achieve low-degree multicalibration improves exponentially (in the number of classes) over full multicalibration. Our work presents compelling evidence that low-degree multicalibration represents a sweet spot, pairing computational and sample efficiency with strong fairness and accuracy guarantees.},

We show that modifying the exponential mechanism by adding an $\ell_2^2$ regularizer to $F(x)$ and sampling from $\pi(x)\propto \exp(-k(F(x)+\mu\|x\|_2^2/2))$ recovers both the known optimal empirical risk and population loss under $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. Furthermore, we show how to implement this mechanism using $\widetilde{O}(n \min(d, n))$ queries to $f_i(x)$ for the DP-SCO where $n$ is the number of samples/users and $d$ is the ambient dimension. We also give a (nearly) matching lower bound $\widetilde{\Omega}(n \min(d, n))$ on the number of evaluation queries. Our results utilize the following tools that are of independent interest: (1) We prove Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) of the exponential mechanism if the loss function is strongly convex and the perturbation is Lipschitz. Our privacy bound is \emph{optimal} as it includes the privacy of Gaussian mechanism as a special case and is proved using the isoperimetric inequality for strongly log-concave measures. (2) We show how to sample from $\exp(-F(x)-\mu \|x\|^2_2/2)$ for $G$-Lipschitz $F$ with $\eta$ error in total variation (TV) distance using $\widetilde{O}((G^2/\mu) \log^2(d/\eta))$ unbiased queries to $F(x)$. This is the first sampler whose query complexity has \emph{polylogarithmic dependence} on both dimension $d$ and accuracy $\eta$.},

 abstract = {Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) are a widely used probabilistic model for negatively correlated sets. DPPs have been successfully employed in Machine Learning applications to select a diverse, yet representative subset of data. In seminal work on DPPs in Machine Learning, Kulesza conjectured in his PhD Thesis (2011) that the problem of finding a maximum likelihood DPP model for a given data set is NP-complete. In this work we prove Kulesza's conjecture. In fact, we prove the following stronger hardness of approximation result: even computing a $\left(1-O(\frac{1}{\log^9{N}})\right)$-approximation to the maximum log-likelihood of a DPP on a ground set of $N$ elements is NP-complete. At the same time, we also obtain the first polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a nontrivial worst-case approximation to the optimal log-likelihood: the approximation factor is $\frac{1}{(1+o(1))\log{m}}$ unconditionally (for data sets that consist of $m$ subsets), and can be improved to $1-\frac{1+o(1)}{\log N}$ if all $N$ elements appear in a $O(1/N)$-fraction of the subsets. In terms of techniques, we reduce approximating the maximum log-likelihood of DPPs on a data set to solving a gap instance of a "vector coloring" problem on a hypergraph. Such a hypergraph is built on a bounded-degree graph construction of Bogdanov, Obata and Trevisan (FOCS 2002), and is further enhanced by the strong expanders of Alon and Capalbo (FOCS 2007) to serve our purposes.},

 abstract = {Motivated by robust dynamic resource allocation in operations research, we study the \textit{Online Learning to Transport} (OLT) problem where the decision variable is a probability measure, an infinite-dimensional object. We draw connections between online learning, optimal transport, and partial differential equations through an insight called the minimal selection principle, originally studied in the Wasserstein gradient flow setting by \citet{Ambrosio_2005}. This allows us to extend the standard online learning framework to the infinite-dimensional setting seamlessly. Based on our framework, we derive a novel method called the \textit{minimal selection or exploration (MSoE) algorithm} to solve OLT problems using mean-field approximation and discretization techniques. In the displacement convex setting, the main theoretical message underpinning our approach is that minimizing transport cost over time (via the minimal selection principle) ensures optimal cumulative regret upper bounds. On the algorithmic side, our MSoE algorithm applies beyond the displacement convex setting, making the mathematical theory of optimal transport practically relevant to non-convex settings common in dynamic resource allocation.},

 abstract = {Uniformity testing is one of the most well-studied problems in property testing, with many known test statistics, including ones based on counting collisions, singletons, and the empirical TV distance. It is known that the optimal sample complexity to distinguish the uniform distribution on $m$ elements from any $\epsilon$-far distribution with $1-\delta$ probability is $n = \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{m \log (1/\delta)}}{\epsilon^2} + \frac{\log (1/\delta)}{\epsilon^2}\right)$, which is achieved by the empirical TV tester. Yet in simulation, these theoretical analyses are misleading: in many cases, they do not correctly rank order the performance of existing testers, even in an asymptotic regime of all parameters tending to $0$ or $\infty$. We explain this discrepancy by studying the \emph{constant factors} required by the algorithms. We show that the collisions tester achieves a sharp maximal constant in the number of standard deviations of separation between uniform and non-uniform inputs. We then introduce a new tester based on the Huber loss, and show that it not only matches this separation, but also has tails corresponding to a Gaussian with this separation. This leads to a sample complexity of $(1 + o(1))\frac{\sqrt{m \log (1/\delta)}}{\epsilon^2}$ in the regime where this term is dominant, unlike all other existing testers.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of making calibrated probabilistic forecasts for a binary sequence generated by an adversarial nature. Following the seminal paper of Foster and Vohra (1998), nature is often modeled as an adaptive adversary who sees all activity of the forecaster except the randomization that the forecaster may deploy. A number of papers have proposed randomized forecasting strategies that achieve an $\epsilon$-calibration error rate of $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which we prove is tight in general. On the other hand, it is well known that it is not possible to be calibrated without randomization, or if nature also sees the forecaster's randomization; in both cases the calibration error could be $\Omega(1)$. Inspired by the equally seminal works on the "power of two choices" and imprecise probability theory, we study a small variant of the standard online calibration problem. The adversary gives the forecaster the option of making two nearby probabilistic forecasts, or equivalently an interval forecast of small width, and the endpoint closest to the revealed outcome is used to judge calibration. This power of two choices, or imprecise forecast, accords the forecaster with significant power -- we show that a faster $\epsilon$-calibration rate of $O(1/T)$ can be achieved even without deploying any randomization.},

 abstract = {Consider $n$ items, each of which is characterised by one of $d+1$ possible features in $\{0, \ldots, d\}$. We study the inference task of learning these types by queries on subsets, or pools, of the items that only reveal a form of coarsened information on the features - in our case, the sum of all the features in the pool. This is a realistic scenario in situations where one has memory or technical constraints in the data collection process, or where the data is subject to anonymisation. Related prominent problems are the quantitative group testing problem, of which it is a generalisation, as well as the compressed sensing problem, of which it is a special case. In the present article, we are interested in the minimum number of queries needed to efficiently infer the labels, if one of the features, say $0$, is dominant in the sense that the number $k$ of non-zero features among the items is much smaller than $n$. It is known that in this case, all features can be recovered in exponential time by using no more than $O(k)$ queries. However, so far, all \textit{efficient} inference algorithms required at least $\Omega(k\ln n)$ queries, and it was unknown whether this gap is artificial or of a fundamental nature. Here we show that indeed, the previous gap between the information-theoretic and computational bounds is not inherent to the problem by providing an efficient algorithm that succeeds with high probability and employs no more than $O(k)$ measurements. This also solves a long standing open question for the quantitative group testing problem.},

 abstract = {The equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability is a fundamental phenomenon in learning theory. With variants ranging from classical settings like PAC learning and regression to recent trends such as adversarially robust learning, it's surprising that we still lack a unified theory; traditional proofs of the equivalence tend to be disparate, and rely on strong model-specific assumptions like uniform convergence and sample compression. In this work, we give the first model-independent framework explaining the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learnability: a three-line blackbox reduction that simplifies, unifies, and extends our understanding across a wide variety of settings. This includes models with no known characterization of learnability such as learning with arbitrary distributional assumptions and more general loss functions, as well as a host of other popular settings such as robust learning, partial learning, fair learning, and the statistical query model. More generally, we argue that the equivalence of realizable and agnostic learning is actually a special case of a broader phenomenon we call property generalization: any desirable property of a learning algorithm (e.g. noise tolerance, privacy, stability) that can be satisfied over finite hypothesis classes extends (possibly in some variation) to any learnable hypothesis class.},

Recent work of Diakonikolas et al. (2021) shows that any Statistical Query (SQ) algorithm for agnostically learning the class of intersections of $k$ halfspaces over $\mathbb{R}^n$ to constant excess error either must make queries of tolerance at most $n^{-\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log k})}$ or must make $2^{n^{\Omega(1)}}$ queries. We strengthen this result by improving the tolerance requirement to $n^{-\tilde{\Omega}(\log k)}$. This lower bound is essentially best possible since an SQ algorithm of Klivans et al. (2008) agnostically learns this class to any constant excess error using $n^{O(\log k)}$ queries of tolerance $n^{-O(\log k)}$. We prove two variants of our lower bound, each of which combines ingredients from Diakonikolas et al. (2021) with (an extension of) a different earlier approach for agnostic SQ lower bounds for the Boolean setting due to Dachman-Soled et al. (2014). Our approach also yields lower bounds for agnostically SQ learning the class of "convex subspace juntas" (studied by Vempala, 2010) and the class of sets with bounded Gaussian surface area; all of these lower bounds are nearly optimal since they essentially match known upper bounds from Klivans et al.

 abstract = {This paper considers the multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem and provides a new best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm that works nearly optimally in both stochastic and adversarial settings. In stochastic settings, some existing BOBW algorithms achieve tight gap-dependent regret bounds of $O(\sum_{i: \Delta_i>0} \frac{\log T}{\Delta_i})$ for suboptimality gap $\Delta_i$ of arm $i$ and time horizon $T$. As Audibert et al. [2007] have shown, however, that the performance can be improved in stochastic environments with low-variance arms. In fact, they have provided a stochastic MAB algorithm with gap-variance-dependent regret bounds of $O(\sum_{i: \Delta_i>0} (\frac{\sigma_i^2}{\Delta_i} + 1) \log T )$ for loss variance $\sigma_i^2$ of arm $i$. In this paper, we propose the first BOBW algorithm with gap-variance-dependent bounds, showing that the variance information can be used even in the possibly adversarial environment. Further, the leading constant factor in our gap-variance dependent bound is only (almost) twice the value for the lower bound. Additionally, the proposed algorithm enjoys multiple data-dependent regret bounds in adversarial settings and works well in stochastic settings with adversarial corruptions. The proposed algorithm is based on the follow-the-regularized-leader method and employs adaptive learning rates that depend on the empirical prediction error of the loss, which leads to gap-variance-dependent regret bounds reflecting the variance of the arms.},

 abstract = {We design accelerated algorithms with improved rates for several fundamental classes of optimization problems. Our algorithms all build upon techniques related to the analysis of primal-dual extragradient methods via relative Lipschitzness proposed recently by [CST21]. (1) Separable minimax optimization. We study separable minimax optimization problems $\min_x \max_y f(x) - g(y) + h(x, y)$, where $f$ and $g$ have smoothness and strong convexity parameters $(L^x, \mu^x)$, $(L^y, \mu^y)$, and $h$ is convex-concave with a $(\Lambda^{xx}, \Lambda^{xy}, \Lambda^{yy})$-blockwise operator norm bounded Hessian. We provide an algorithm with gradient query complexity $\tilde{O}\left(\sqrt{\frac{L^{x}}{\mu^{x}}} + \sqrt{\frac{L^{y}}{\mu^{y}}} + \frac{\Lambda^{xx}}{\mu^{x}} + \frac{\Lambda^{xy}}{\sqrt{\mu^{x}\mu^{y}}} + \frac{\Lambda^{yy}}{\mu^{y}}\right)$. Notably, for convex-concave minimax problems with bilinear coupling (e.g.\ quadratics), where $\Lambda^{xx} = \Lambda^{yy} = 0$, our rate matches a lower bound of [ZHZ19]. (2) Finite sum optimization. We study finite sum optimization problems $\min_x \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i\in[n]} f_i(x)$, where each $f_i$ is $L_i$-smooth and the overall problem is $\mu$-strongly convex. We provide an algorithm with gradient query complexity $\tilde{O}\left(n + \sum_{i\in[n]} \sqrt{\frac{L_i}{n\mu}} \right)$. Notably, when the smoothness bounds $\{L_i\}_{i\in[n]}$ are non-uniform, our rate improves upon accelerated SVRG [LMH15, FGKS15] and Katyusha [All17] by up to a $\sqrt{n}$ factor. (3) Minimax finite sums. We generalize our algorithms for minimax and finite sum optimization to solve a natural family of minimax finite sum optimization problems at an accelerated rate, encapsulating both above results up to a logarithmic factor.},

 abstract = {Reinforcement learning with function approximation has recently achieved tremendous results in applications with large state spaces. This empirical success has motivated a growing body of theoretical work proposing necessary and sufficient conditions under which efficient reinforcement learning is possible. From this line of work, a remarkably simple minimal sufficient condition has emerged for sample efficient reinforcement learning: MDPs with optimal value function $V^*$ and $Q^*$ linear in some known low-dimensional features. In this setting, recent works have designed sample efficient algorithms which require a number of samples polynomial in the feature dimension and independent of the size of state space. They however leave finding computationally efficient algorithms as future work and this is considered a major open problem in the community. In this work, we make progress on this open problem by presenting the first computational lower bound for RL with linear function approximation: unless NP=RP, no randomized polynomial time algorithm exists for deterministic transition MDPs with a constant number of actions and linear optimal value functions. To prove this, we show a reduction from Unique-Sat, where we convert a CNF formula into an MDP with deterministic transitions, constant number of actions and low dimensional linear optimal value functions. This result also exhibits the first computational-statistical gap in reinforcement learning with linear function approximation, as the underlying statistical problem is information-theoretically solvable with a polynomial number of queries, but no computationally efficient algorithm exists unless NP=RP. Finally, we also prove a quasi-polynomial time lower bound under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.},

 abstract = {Thompson Sampling (TS) is an efficient method for decision-making under uncertainty, where an action is sampled from a carefully prescribed distribution which is updated based on the observed data. In this work, we study the problem of adaptive control of stabilizable linear-quadratic regulators (LQRs) using TS, where the system dynamics are unknown. Previous works have established that $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ frequentist regret is optimal for the adaptive control of LQRs. However, the existing methods either work only in restrictive settings, require a priori known stabilizing controllers, or utilize computationally intractable approaches. We propose an efficient TS algorithm for the adaptive control of LQRs, TS-based Adaptive Control, TSAC, that attains $\tilde O(\sqrt{T})$ regret, even for multidimensional systems, thereby solving the open problem posed in Abeille and Lazaric (2018). TSAC does not require a priori known stabilizing controller and achieves fast stabilization of the underlying system by effectively exploring the environment in the early stages. Our result hinges on developing a novel lower bound on the probability that the TS provides an optimistic sample. By carefully prescribing an early exploration strategy and a policy update rule, we show that TS achieves order-optimal regret in adaptive control of multidimensional stabilizable LQRs. We empirically demonstrate the performance and the efficiency of TSAC in several adaptive control tasks.},

 abstract = {Many important learning algorithms, such as stochastic gradient methods, are often deployed to solve nonlinear problems on Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by these applications, we propose a family of Riemannian algorithms generalizing and extending the seminal stochastic approximation framework of Robbins and Monro (1951). Compared to their Euclidean counterparts, Riemannian iterative algorithms are much less understood due to the lack of a global linear structure on the manifold. We overcome this difficulty by introducing an extended Fermi coordinate frame which allows us to map the asymptotic behavior of the proposed Riemannian RobbinsâMonro (RRM) class of algorithms to that of an associated deterministic dynamical system under very mild assumptions on the underlying manifold. In so doing, we provide a general template of almost sure convergence results that mirrors and extends the existing theory for Euclidean Robbins-Monro schemes, albeit with a significantly more involved analysis that requires a number of new geometric ingredients. We showcase the flexibility of the proposed RRM framework by using it to establish the convergence of a retraction-based analogue of the popular optimistic / extra-gradient methods for solving minimization problems and games, and we provide a unified treatment for their convergence.},

We consider the problem of minimizing a function $f : \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ which is implicitly decomposable as the sum of $m$ unknown non-interacting smooth, strongly convex functions and provide a method which solves this problem with a number of gradient evaluations that scales (up to logarithmic factors) as the product of the square-root of the condition numbers of the components. This complexity bound (which we prove is nearly optimal) can improve almost exponentially on that of accelerated gradient methods, which grow as the square root of the condition number of $f$. Additionally, we provide efficient methods for solving stochastic, quadratic variants of this multiscale optimization problem. Rather than learn the decomposition of $f$ (which would be prohibitively expensive), our methods apply a clean recursive "Big-Step-Little-Step" interleaving of standard methods. The resulting algorithms use $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d m)$ space, are numerically stable, and open the door to a more fine-grained understanding of the complexity of convex optimization beyond condition number.},

 abstract = {We consider Ising models on the hypercube with a general interaction matrix $J$, and give a polynomial time sampling algorithm when all but $O(1)$ eigenvalues of $J$ lie in an interval of length one, a situation which occurs in many models of interest. This was previously known for the Glauber dynamics when *all* eigenvalues fit in an interval of length one; however, a single outlier can force the Glauber dynamics to mix torpidly. Our general result implies the first polynomial time sampling algorithms for low-rank Ising models such as Hopfield networks with a fixed number of patterns and Bayesian clustering models with low-dimensional contexts, and greatly improves the polynomial time sampling regime for the antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic Ising model with inconsistent field on expander graphs. It also improves on previous approximation algorithm results based on the naive mean-field approximation in variational methods and statistical physics. Our approach is based on a new fusion of ideas from the MCMC and variational inference worlds. As part of our algorithm, we define a new nonconvex variational problem which allows us to sample from an exponential reweighting of a distribution by a negative definite quadratic form, and show how to make this procedure provably efficient using stochastic gradient descent. On top of this, we construct a new simulated tempering chain (on an extended state space arising from the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform) which overcomes the obstacle posed by large positive eigenvalues, and combine it with the SGD-based sampler to solve the full problem.},

 abstract = {We give the first polynomial time and sample $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differentially private (DP) algorithm to estimate the mean, covariance and higher moments in the presence of a constant fraction of adversarial outliers. Our algorithm succeeds for families of distributions that satisfy two well-studied properties in prior works on robust estimation: certifiable subgaussianity of directional moments and certifiable hypercontractivity of degree 2 polynomials. Our recovery guarantees hold in the "right affine-invariant norms": Mahalanobis distance for mean, multiplicative spectral and relative Frobenius distance guarantees for covariance and injective norms for higher moments. Prior works obtained private robust algorithms for mean estimation of subgaussian distributions with bounded covariance. For covariance estimation, ours is the first efficient algorithm (even in the absence of outliers) that succeeds without any condition-number assumptions. Our algorithms arise from a new framework that provides a general blueprint for modifying convex relaxations for robust estimation to satisfy strong worst-case stability guarantees in the appropriate parameter norms whenever the algorithms produce witnesses of correctness in their run. We verify such guarantees for a modification of standard sum-of-squares (SoS) semidefinite programming relaxations for robust estimation. Our privacy guarantees are obtained by combining stability guarantees with a new "estimate dependent" noise injection mechanism in which noise scales with the eigenvalues of the estimated covariance. We believe this framework will be useful more generally in obtaining DP counterparts of robust estimators. Independently of our work, Ashtiani and Liaw [AL21] also obtained a polynomial time and sample private robust estimation algorithm for Gaussian distributions.},

Improvement can be measured along various dimensions, however, and it has proved difficult to achieve improvements both in terms of nonasymptotic measures of convergence rate and asymptotic measures of distributional tightness. In this work, we consider first-order stochastic optimization from a general statistical point of view, motivating a specific form of recursive averaging of past stochastic gradients. The resulting algorithm, which we refer to as \emph{Recursive One-Over-T SGD} (ROOT-SGD), matches the state-of-the-art convergence rate among online variance-reduced stochastic approximation methods.

 abstract = {We introduce a universal framework for characterizing the statistical efficiency of a statistical estimation problem with differential privacy guarantees. Our framework, which we call High-dimensional Propose-Test-Release (HPTR), builds upon three crucial components: the exponential mechanism, robust statistics, and the Propose-Test-Release mechanism. Gluing all these together is the concept of resilience, which is central to robust statistical estimation. Resilience guides the design of the algorithm, the sensitivity analysis, and the success probability analysis of the test step in Propose-Test-Release. The key insight is that if we design an exponential mechanism that accesses the data only via one-dimensional robust statistics, then the resulting local sensitivity can be dramatically reduced. Using resilience, we can provide tight local sensitivity bounds. These tight bounds readily translate into near-optimal utility guarantees in several cases. We give a general recipe for applying HPTR to a given instance of a statistical estimation problem and demonstrate it on canonical problems of mean estimation, linear regression, covariance estimation, and principal component analysis. We introduce a general utility analysis technique that proves that HPTR nearly achieves the optimal sample complexity under several scenarios studied in the literature.},

 abstract = {The vast majority of convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient methods in the literature focus on convergence in expectation, whereas trajectory-wise almost sure convergence is clearly important to ensure that any instantiation of the stochastic algorithms would converge with probability one. Here we provide a unified almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient descent (SGD), stochastic heavy-ball (SHB), and stochastic Nesterov's accelerated gradient (SNAG) methods. We show, for the first time, that the almost sure convergence rates obtained for these stochastic gradient methods on strongly convex functions, are arbitrarily close to their optimal convergence rates possible. For non-convex objective functions, we not only show that a weighted average of the squared gradient norms converges to zero almost surely, but also the last iterates of the algorithms. We further provide last-iterate almost sure convergence rates analysis for stochastic gradient methods on weakly convex smooth functions, in contrast with most existing results in the literature that only provide convergence in expectation for a weighted average of the iterates.},

 abstract = {We study the stochastic multi-player multi-armed bandit problem. In this problem, $m$ players cooperate to maximize their total reward from $K > m$ arms. However the players cannot communicate and are penalized (e.g. receive no reward) if they pull the same arm at the same time. We ask whether it is possible to obtain optimal instance-dependent regret $\tilde{O}(1/\Delta)$ where $\Delta$ is the gap between the $m$-th and $m+1$-st best arms. Such guarantees were recently achieved in a model allowing the players to implicitly communicate through intentional collisions. Surprisingly, we show that with no communication at all, such guarantees are not achievable. In fact, obtaining the optimal $\tilde{O}(1/\Delta)$ regret for some values of $\Delta$ necessarily implies strictly sub-optimal regret in other regimes. Our main result is a complete characterization of the Pareto optimal instance-dependent trade-offs that are possible with no communication. Our algorithm generalizes that of Bubeck, Budzinski, and the second author. As there, our algorithm succeeds even when feedback upon collision can be corrupted by an adaptive adversary, thanks to a strong no-collision property. Our lower bound is based on topological obstructions at multiple scales and is completely new.},

 abstract = {Applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL), in which agents learn to make a sequence of decisions despite lacking complete information about the latent states of the controlled system, that is, they act under partial observability of the states, are ubiquitous. Partially observable RL can be notoriously difficult -- well-known information-theoretic results show that learning partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) requires an exponential number of samples in the worst case. Yet, this does not rule out the existence of large subclasses of POMDPs over which learning is tractable. In this paper we identify such a subclass, which we call weakly revealing POMDPs. This family rules out the pathological instances of POMDPs where observations are uninformative to a degree that makes learning hard. We prove that for weakly revealing POMDPs, a simple algorithm combining optimism and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is sufficient to guarantee polynomial sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first provably sample-efficient result for learning from interactions in overcomplete POMDPs, where the number of latent states can be larger than the number of observations.},

 abstract = {Since the celebrated works of Russo and Zou (2016,2019) and Xu and Raginsky (2017), it has been well known that the generalization error of supervised learning algorithms can be bounded in terms of the mutual information between their input and the output, given that the loss of any fixed hypothesis has a subgaussian tail. In this work, we generalize this result beyond the standard choice of Shannon's mutual information to measure the dependence between the input and the output. Our main result shows that it is indeed possible to replace the mutual information by any strongly convex function of the joint input-output distribution, with the subgaussianity condition on the losses replaced by a bound on an appropriately chosen norm capturing the geometry of the dependence measure. This allows us to derive a range of generalization bounds that are either entirely new or strengthen previously known ones. Examples include bounds stated in terms of $p$-norm divergences and the Wasserstein-2 distance, which are respectively applicable for heavy-tailed loss distributions and highly smooth loss functions. Our analysis is entirely based on elementary tools from convex analysis by tracking the growth of a potential function associated with the dependence measure and the loss function.},

While all previous works assume known and homogeneous curvature on these loss functions, we study a heterogeneous setting where each function has its own curvature that is only revealed after the learner makes a decision. We develop an efficient algorithm that is able to adapt to the curvature on the fly. Specifically, our algorithm not only recovers or \emph{even improves} existing results for several homogeneous settings, but also leads to surprising results for some heterogeneous settings -- for example, while Hazan and Levy (2014) showed that $\widetilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable for a sequence of $T$ smooth and strongly convex $d$-dimensional functions, our algorithm reveals that the same is achievable even if $T^{3/4}$ of them are not strongly convex, and sometimes even if a constant fraction of them are not strongly convex. Our approach is inspired by the framework of Bartlett et al. (2007) who studied a similar heterogeneous setting but with stronger gradient feedback. Extending their framework to the bandit feedback setting requires novel ideas such as lifting the feasible domain and using a logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier regularizer.},

The polynomial dependence on $M$, however, prevents one from applying these algorithms to many applications where $M$ is poly$(T)$ or even larger. Motivated by this issue, we propose a new recipe to corral a larger band of bandit algorithms whose regret overhead has only \emph{logarithmic} dependence on $M$ as long as some conditions are satisfied. As the main example, we apply our recipe to the problem of adversarial linear bandits over a $d$-dimensional $\ell_p$ unit-ball for $p \in (1,2]$. By corralling a large set of $T$ base algorithms, each starting at a different time step, our final algorithm achieves the first optimal switching regret $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d S T})$ when competing against a sequence of comparators with $S$ switches (for some known $S$).

We study restrictions on the adversary that enable efficient minimization of the \emph{complete policy regret}, which is the strongest possible version of policy regret. We identify a gap in the current theoretical understanding of what sorts of restrictions permit tractability in this challenging setting. To resolve this gap, we consider a generalization of the stochastic multi armed bandit, which we call the \emph{tallying bandit}. This is an online learning setting with an $m$-memory bounded adversary, where the average loss for playing an action is an unknown function of the number (or tally) of times that the action was played in the last $m$ timesteps. For tallying bandit problems with $K$ actions and time horizon $T$, we provide an algorithm that w.h.p achieves a complete policy regret guarantee of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(mK\sqrt{T})$, where the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ notation hides only logarithmic factors. We additionally prove an $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{m K T})$ lower bound on the expected complete policy regret of any tallying bandit algorithm, demonstrating the near optimality of our method.},

In full generality, matching upper and lower bounds are known which show that this comes at the unavoidable cost of an additive $G U^3$, which is not needed when either $G$ or $U$ is known in advance. Surprisingly, recent results by Kempka et al. (2019) show that no such price for adaptivity is needed in the specific case of $1$-Lipschitz losses like the hinge loss. We follow up on this observation by showing that there is in fact never a price to pay for adaptivity if we specialise to any of the other common supervised online learning losses: our results cover log loss, (linear and non-parametric) logistic regression, square loss prediction, and (linear and non-parametric) least-squares regression. We also fill in several gaps in the literature by providing matching lower bounds with an explicit dependence on $U$. In all cases we obtain scale-free algorithms, which are suitably invariant under rescaling of the data. Our general goal is to establish achievable rates without concern for computational efficiency, but for linear logistic regression we also provide an adaptive method that is as efficient as the recent non-adaptive algorithm by Agarwal et al.

 abstract = {In constrained convex optimization, existing methods based on the ellipsoid or cutting plane method do not scale well with the dimension of the ambient space. Alternative approaches such as Projected Gradient Descent only provide a computational benefit for simple convex sets such as Euclidean balls, where Euclidean projections can be performed efficiently. For other sets, the cost of the projections can be too high. To circumvent these issues, alternative methods based on the famous Frank-Wolfe algorithm have been studied and used. Such methods use a Linear Optimization Oracle at each iteration instead of Euclidean projections; the former can often be performed efficiently. Such methods have also been extended to the online and stochastic optimization settings. However, the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and its variants do not achieve the optimal performance, in terms of regret or rate, for general convex sets. What is more, the Linear Optimization Oracle they use can still be computationally expensive in some cases. In this paper, we move away from Frank-Wolfe style algorithms and present a new reduction that turns any algorithm A defined on a Euclidean ball (where projections are cheap) to an algorithm on a constrained set C contained within the ball, without sacrificing the performance of the original algorithm A by much. Our reduction requires O(T log T) calls to a Membership Oracle on C after T rounds, and no linear optimization on C is needed. Using our reduction, we recover optimal regret bounds [resp. rates], in terms of the number of iterations, in online [resp. stochastic] convex optimization. Our guarantees are also useful in the offline convex optimization setting when the dimension of the ambient space is large.},

 abstract = {Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) are an extremely popular method for training generative models to produce high quality synthetic data. While WGAN-GP were initially developed to calculate the Wasserstein 1 distance between generated and real data, recent works (e.g. Stanczuk et al. (2021)) have provided empirical evidence that this does not occur, and have argued that WGAN-GP perform well not in spite of this issue, but because of it. In this paper we show for the first time that WGAN-GP compute the minimum of a different optimal transport problem, the so-called congested transport (Carlier et al. (2008)). Congested transport determines the cost of moving one distribution to another under a transport model that penalizes congestion. For WGAN-GP, we find that the congestion penalty has a spatially varying component determined by the sampling strategy used in Gulrajani et al. (2017) which acts like a local speed limit, making congestion cost less in some regions than others. This aspect of the congested transport problem is new in that the congestion penalty turns out to be unbounded and depend on the distributions to be transported, and so we provide the necessary mathematical proofs for this setting. We use our discovery to show that the gradients of solutions to the optimization problem in WGAN-GP determine the time averaged momentum of optimal mass flow. This is in contrast to the gradients of Kantorovich potentials for the Wasserstein 1 distance, which only determine the normalized direction of flow. This may explain, in support of Stanczuk et al. (2021), the success of WGAN-GP, since the training of the generator is based on these gradients.},

 abstract = {Consider supervised learning from i.i.d. samples $\{{\boldsymbol x}_i,y_i\}_{i\le n}$ where ${\boldsymbol x}_i \in\mathbb{R}^p$ are feature vectors and ${y} \in \mathbb{R}$ are labels. We study empirical risk minimization over a class of functions that are parameterized by $\mathsf{k} = O(1)$ vectors ${\boldsymbol \theta}_1, . . . , {\boldsymbol \theta}_{\mathsf k} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ , and prove universality results both for the training and test error. Namely, under the proportional asymptotics $n,p\to\infty$, with $n/p = \Theta(1)$, we prove that the training error depends on the random features distribution only through its covariance structure. Further, we prove that the minimum test error over near-empirical risk minimizers enjoys similar universality properties. In particular, the asymptotics of these quantities can be computed $-$to leading order$-$ under a simpler model in which the feature vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ are replaced by Gaussian vectors ${\boldsymbol g}_i$ with the same covariance. Earlier universality results were limited to strongly convex learning procedures, or to feature vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ with independent entries. Our results do not make any of these assumptions. Our assumptions are general enough to include feature vectors ${\boldsymbol x}_i$ that are produced by randomized featurization maps. In particular we explicitly check the assumptions for certain random features models (computing the output of a one-layer neural network with random weights) and neural tangent models (first-order Taylor approximation of two-layer networks).},

 abstract = {We study stochastic approximation procedures for approximately solving a $d$-dimensional linear fixed point equation based on observing a trajectory of length $n$ from an ergodic Markov chain. We first exhibit a non-asymptotic bound of the order $t_{\mathrm{mix}} \tfrac{d}{n}$ on the squared error of the last iterate of a standard scheme, where $t_{\mathrm{mix}}$ is a mixing time. We then prove a non-asymptotic instance-dependent bound on a suitably averaged sequence of iterates, with a leading term that matches the local asymptotic minimax limit, including sharp dependence on the parameters $(d, t_{\mathrm{mix}})$ in the higher order terms. We complement these upper bounds with a non-asymptotic minimax lower bound that establishes the instance-optimality of the averaged SA estimator. We derive corollaries of these results for policy evaluation with Markov noise -- covering the TD($\lambda$) family of algorithms for all $\lambda \in [0, 1)$ -- and linear autoregressive models. Our instance-dependent characterizations open the door to the design of fine-grained model selection procedures for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., choosing the value of $\lambda$ when running the TD($\lambda$) algorithm).},

However, the known rates grow exponentially with the dimension of the space. In this work, we provide a convergence analysis of GLD and SGLD when the optimization space is an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. More precisely, we derive non-asymptotic, dimension-free convergence rates for GLD/SGLD when performing regularized non-convex optimization in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

Specifically, for $d$-dimensional Gaussian distributions with known covariance $\Sigma$, we can test whether the distribution comes from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ for some fixed $\mu^*$ or from some $\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)$ with total variation distance at least $\alpha$ from $\mathcal{N}(\mu^*, \Sigma)$ with $(\varepsilon, 0)$-differential privacy, using only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} + \frac{d^{1/3}}{\alpha^{4/3} \cdot \varepsilon^{2/3}} + \frac{1}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\] samples if the algorithm is allowed to be computationally inefficient, and only \[\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^{1/2}}{\alpha^2} + \frac{d^{1/4}}{\alpha \cdot \varepsilon}\right)\] samples for a computationally efficient algorithm. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that our computationally inefficient algorithm has optimal sample complexity. We also extend our algorithms to various related problems, including mean testing of Gaussians with bounded but unknown covariance, uniformity testing of product distributions over $\{-1, 1\}^d$, and tolerant testing. Our results improve over the previous best work of Canonne et al.~\cite{CanonneKMUZ20} for both computationally efficient and inefficient algorithms, and even our computationally efficient algorithm matches the optimal \emph{non-private} sample complexity of $O\left(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{\alpha^2}\right)$ in many standard parameter settings. In addition, our results show that, surprisingly, private identity testing of $d$-dimensional Gaussians can be done with fewer samples than private identity testing of discrete distributions over a domain of size $d$ \cite{AcharyaSZ18}, which refutes a conjectured lower bound of~\cite{CanonneKMUZ20}.},

 abstract = {We give tight statistical query (SQ) lower bounds for learnining halfspaces in the presence of Massart noise. In particular, suppose that all labels are corrupted with probability at most $\eta$. We show that for arbitrary $\eta \in [0,1/2]$ every SQ algorithm achieving misclassification error better than $\eta$ requires queries of superpolynomial accuracy or at least a superpolynomial number of queries. Further, this continues to hold even if the information-theoretically optimal error $\mathrm{OPT}$ is as small as $\exp\left(-\log^c(d)\right)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $0 < c < 1$ is an arbitrary absolute constant, and an overwhelming fraction of examples are noiseless. Our lower bound matches known polynomial time algorithms, which are also implementable in the SQ framework. Previously, such lower bounds only ruled out algorithms achieving error $\mathrm{OPT} + \epsilon$ or error better than $\Omega(\eta)$ or, if $\eta$ is close to $1/2$, error $\eta - o_\eta(1)$, where the term $o_\eta(1)$ is constant in $d$ but going to 0 for $\eta$ approaching $1/2$. As a consequence, we also show that achieving misclassification error better than $1/2$ in the $(A,\alpha)$-Tsybakov model is SQ-hard for $A$ constant and $\alpha$ bounded away from 1.},

 abstract = {The design of efficient differentially private (DP) learning algorithms with dimension-independent learning guarantees has been one of the central challenges in the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing algorithms either suffer from weak generalization guarantees, restrictive model assumptions, or quite large computation cost. In non-private learning, dimension-independent generalization guarantees based on the notion of confidence margin were shown to be the most informative and useful learning guarantees. This motivates a systematic study of DP learning algorithms with confidence-margin generalization guarantees. A recent work has started exploring this direction in the context of linear and kernel-based classification as well as certain classes of neural networks (NNs). Despite showing several positive results, a number of fundamental questions are still open. We identify two major open problems related to DP margin-based learning algorithms. The first problem relates to the design of algorithms with more favorable computational cost. The second one pertains to the question of achieving margin guarantees for NNs under DP with no explicit dependence on the network size.},

 abstract = {The results in Google Search, Twitter and other popular search engines traditionally utilize the Personalized PageRank (PPR) vector to rank the results in their search engines. Additionally, there is a plethora of applications beyond the web~\citep{G15} which are modelled using PPR. In recent work by~\cite{ACL06,GM14_ICML,fountoulakis2019variational}, it was shown that small probabilities in PPR vector, e.g., web pages beyond the first page in Google Search, can be thresholded out automatically by utilizing $\ell_1$-regularization or equivalently by early termination. Both versions result in approximate computation of PPR. The current fastest method for computing the $\ell_1$-regularized PPR uses proximal gradient method and requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\alpha \rho)^{-1})$ total running time, where $\alpha$ is the teleportation parameter and $\rho$ is a parameter which controls the level of sparsity in the $\ell_1$-regularized PPR. It is important to note that the running time complexity does not depend on the size of the underlying graph (e.g. the length of the PPR vector). Such property has become a prerequisite to probe modern large scale networks. A seemingly natural way to build an even faster algorithm for computing the $\ell_1$-regularized PPR is to accelerate the proximal gradient method and consequently reduce the running time complexity to $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}((\sqrt{\alpha} \rho)^{-1})$. This will lead to a speed-up by a factor of $1/\sqrt{\alpha}$ and improve the running time of various network analytic methods which build upon PPR. However, the original analysis of the proximal gradient method in~\cite{fountoulakis2019variational} does not apply to the accelerated version. While we have empirical evidence that indicates accelerated proximal gradient requires less total running time, it is not even clear if acceleration could lead to a worse running time complexity in the worst case.},

Yet, despite significant progress on the problem, the proposed methods depend crucially on knowing the exact probabilities of errors of the underlying fully-random oracle. In this work, we develop robust learning methods that tolerate general semi-random noise obtaining qualitatively the same guarantees as the best possible methods in the fully-random model. More specifically, given a set of $n$ points with an unknown underlying partition, we are allowed to query pairs of points $u,v$ to check if they are in the same cluster, but with probability $p$, the answer may be adversarially chosen. We show that information theoretically $O\left(\frac{nk \log n} {(1-2p)^2}\right)$ queries suffice to learn any cluster of sufficiently large size. Our main result is a computationally efficient algorithm that can identify large clusters with $O\left(\frac{nk \log n} {(1-2p)^2}\right) + \text{poly}\left(\log n, k, \frac{1}{1-2p} \right)$ queries, matching the guarantees of the best known algorithms in the fully-random model.

 abstract = {This paper studies the sample complexity of learning the $k$ unknown centers of a balanced Gaussian mixture model (GMM) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with spherical covariance matrix $\sigma^2\mathbf{I}$. In particular, we are interested in the following question: what is the maximal noise level $\sigma^2$, for which the sample complexity is essentially the same as when estimating the centers from labeled measurements? To that end, we restrict attention to a Bayesian formulation of the problem, where the centers are uniformly distributed on the sphere $\sqrt{d}\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. Our main results characterize the exact noise threshold $\sigma^2$ below which the GMM learning problem, in the large system limit $d,k\to\infty$, is as easy as learning from labeled observations, and above which it is substantially harder. The threshold occurs at $\frac{\log k}{d} = \frac12\log\left( 1+\frac{1}{\sigma^2} \right)$, which is the capacity of the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Thinking of the set of $k$ centers as a code, this noise threshold can be interpreted as the largest noise level for which the error probability of the code over the AWGN channel is small. Previous works on the GMM learning problem have identified the minimum distance between the centers as a key parameter in determining the statistical difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM. While our results are only proved for GMMs whose centers are uniformly distributed over the sphere, they hint that perhaps it is the decoding error probability associated with the center constellation as a channel code that determines the statistical difficulty of learning the corresponding GMM, rather than just the minimum distance.},

 abstract = {Depth separation results propose a possible theoretical explanation for the benefits of deep neural networks over shallower architectures, establishing that the former possess superior approximation capabilities. However, there are no known results in which the deeper architecture leverages this advantage into a provable optimization guarantee. We prove that when the data are generated by a distribution with radial symmetry which satisfies some mild assumptions, gradient descent can efficiently learn ball indicator functions using a depth 2 neural network with two layers of sigmoidal activations, and where the hidden layer is held fixed throughout training. By building on and refining existing techniques for approximation lower bounds of neural networks with a single layer of non-linearities, we show that there are $d$-dimensional radial distributions on the data such that ball indicators cannot be learned efficiently by any algorithm to accuracy better than $\Omega(d^{-4})$, nor by a standard gradient descent implementation to accuracy better than a constant. These results establish what is to the best of our knowledge, the first optimization-based separations where the approximation benefits of the stronger architecture provably manifest in practice. Our proof technique introduces new tools and ideas that may be of independent interest in the theoretical study of both the approximation and optimization of neural networks.},

 abstract = {An influential line of recent work has focused on the generalization properties of unregularized gradient-based learning procedures applied to separable linear classification with exponentially-tailed loss functions. The ability of such methods to generalize well has been attributed to the their implicit bias towards large margin predictors, both asymptotically as well as in finite time. We give an additional unified explanation for this generalization and relate it to two simple properties of the optimization objective, that we refer to as realizability and self-boundedness. We introduce a general setting of unconstrained stochastic convex optimization with these properties, and analyze generalization of gradient methods through the lens of algorithmic stability. In this broader setting, we obtain sharp stability bounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent which apply even for a very large number of gradient steps, and use them to derive general generalization bounds for these algorithms. Finally, as direct applications of the general bounds, we return to the setting of linear classification with separable data and establish several novel test loss and test accuracy bounds for gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for a variety of loss functions with different tail decay rates. In some of these cases, our bounds significantly improve upon the existing generalization error bounds in the literature.},

 abstract = {Understanding generalization in modern machine learning settings has been one of the major challenges in statistical learning theory. In this context, recent years have witnessed the development of various generalization bounds suggesting different complexity notions such as the mutual information between the data sample and the algorithm output, compressibility of the hypothesis space, and the fractal dimension of the hypothesis space. While these bounds have illuminated the problem at hand from different angles, their suggested complexity notions might appear seemingly unrelated, thereby restricting their high-level impact. In this study, we prove novel generalization bounds through the lens of rate-distortion theory, and explicitly relate the concepts of mutual information, compressibility, and fractal dimensions in a single mathematical framework. Our approach consists of (i) defining a generalized notion of compressibility by using source coding concepts, and (ii) showing that the `compression error rate' can be linked to the generalization error both in expectation and with high probability. We show that in the `lossless compression' setting, we recover and improve existing mutual information-based bounds, whereas a `lossy compression' scheme allows us to link generalization to the rate-distortion dimension -- a particular notion of fractal dimension. Our results bring a more unified perspective on generalization and open up several future research directions.},

 abstract = {The phenomenon of benign overfitting, where a predictor perfectly fits noisy training data while attaining near-optimal expected loss, has received much attention in recent years, but still remains not fully understood beyond well-specified linear regression setups. In this paper, we provide several new results on when one can or cannot expect benign overfitting to occur, for both regression and classification tasks. We consider a prototypical and rather generic data model for benign overfitting of linear predictors, where an arbitrary input distribution of some fixed dimension $k$ is concatenated with a high-dimensional distribution. For linear regression which is not necessarily well-specified, we show that the minimum-norm interpolating predictor (that standard training methods converge to) is biased towards an inconsistent solution in general, hence benign overfitting will generally not occur. Moreover, we show how this can be extended beyond standard linear regression, by an argument proving how the existence of benign overfitting on some regression problems precludes its existence on other regression problems. We then turn to classification problems, and show that the situation there is much more favorable. Specifically, we prove that the max-margin predictor (to which standard training methods are known to converge in direction) is asymptotically biased towards minimizing a weighted \emph{squared hinge loss}. This allows us to reduce the question of benign overfitting in classification to the simpler question of whether this loss is a good surrogate for the misclassification error, and use it to show benign overfitting in some new settings.},

 abstract = {The Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is the partial differential equation that governs the density evolution of the It\^o process and is of great importance to the literature of statistical physics and machine learning. The FPE can be regarded as a continuity equation where the change of the density is completely determined by a time varying velocity field. Importantly, this velocity field also depends on the current density function. As a result, the ground-truth velocity field can be shown to be the solution of a fixed-point equation, a property that we call self-consistency. In this paper, we exploit this concept to design a potential function of the hypothesis velocity fields, and prove that, if such a function diminishes to zero during the training procedure, the trajectory of the densities generated by the hypothesis velocity fields converges to the solution of the FPE in the Wasserstein-2 sense. The proposed potential function is amenable to neural-network based parameterization as the stochastic gradient with respect to the parameter can be efficiently computed. Once a parameterized model, such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equation is trained, we can generate the entire trajectory to the FPE.},

While this problem has been studied for many years, a recent breakthrough of Auer et al. (2018, 2019) provides the first adaptive procedure to guarantee an optimal (dynamic) regret $\sqrt{LT}$, for $T$ rounds, and an unknown number $L$ of changes. However, while this rate is tight in the worst case, it remained open whether faster rates are possible, without prior knowledge, if few changes in distribution are actually severe. To resolve this question, we propose a new notion of significant shift, which only counts very severe changes that clearly necessitate a restart: roughly, these are changes involving not only best arm switches, but also involving large aggregate differences in reward overtime. Thus, our resulting procedure adaptively achieves rates always faster (sometimes significantly) than $O(\sqrt{ST})$, where $S\ll L$ only counts best arm switches, while at the same time, always faster than the optimal $O(V^{\frac{1}{3}}T^{\frac{2}{3}})$ when expressed in terms of total variation $V$ (which aggregates differences overtime). Our results are expressed in enough generality to also capture non-stochastic adversarial settings.},

By considering the submodularity ratio, strong guarantees have been obtained for maximizing various non-submodular objectives subject to a cardinality constraint via the standard greedy algorithm. Here, we give a natural complement to the notion of weak submodularity by considering how a function changes as elements are removed from the solution. We show that a combination of these two notions can be used to obtain strong guarantees for maximizing non-submodular objectives subject to an arbitrary matroid constraint via both standard and distorted local search algorithms. Our guarantees improve on the state of the art whenever $\gamma$ is moderately large, and agree with known guarantees for submodular objectives when $\gamma = 1$. As motivation, we consider both the subset selection problem, and the Bayesian A-optimal design problem for linear regression, both of which were previously studied in the context of weak submodularity. We show that these problems satisfy our complementary notion of approximate submodularity, as well, allowing us to apply our new guarantees.},

We focus on two standard benchmarks, the sample complexity of stabilization, and the regret of the online learning of the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Prior results state that the statistical difficulty for both benchmarks scales polynomially with the system state dimension up to system-theoretic quantities. However, this does not reveal the whole picture. By utilizing minimax lower bounds for both benchmarks, we prove that there exist non-trivial classes of systems for which learning complexity scales dramatically, i.e. exponentially, with the system dimension. This situation arises in the case of underactuated systems, i.e. systems with fewer inputs than states. Such systems are structurally difficult to control and their system theoretic quantities can scale exponentially with the system dimension dominating learning complexity. Under some additional structural assumptions (bounding systems away from uncontrollability), we provide qualitatively matching upper bounds. We prove that learning complexity can be at most exponential with the controllability index of the system, that is the degree of underactuation.},

In light of previous depth separation theorems, which imply that a similar result cannot hold when the roles of width and depth are interchanged, it follows that depth plays a more significant role than width in the expressive power of neural networks. We extend our results to constructing networks with bounded weights, and to constructing networks with width at most $d+2$, which is close to the minimal possible width due to previous lower bounds. Both of these constructions cause an extra polynomial factor in the number of parameters over the target network. We also show an exact representation of wide and shallow networks using deep and narrow networks which, in certain cases, does not increase the number of parameters over the target network.},

While a simple reduction allows one to apply a low-regret algorithm to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is unknown whether low-regret algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for policy identification. We show that this is not possible -- there exists a fundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret and identifying an $\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate. 
Motivated by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of instance-dependent sample complexity for PAC tabular reinforcement learning which explicitly accounts for the attainable state visitation distributions in the underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze a novel, planning-based algorithm which attains this sample complexity -- yielding a complexity which scales with the suboptimality gaps and the ``reachability'' of a state.

 abstract = {This paper studies the problem of matching two complete graphs with edge weights correlated through latent geometries, extending a recent line of research on random graph matching with independent edge weights to geometric models. Specifically, given a random permutation $\pi^*$ on $[n]$ and $n$ iid pairs of correlated Gaussian vectors $\{X_{\pi^*(i)}, Y_i\}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with noise parameter $\sigma$, the edge weights are given by $A_{ij}=\kappa(X_i,X_j)$ and $B_{ij}=\kappa(Y_i,Y_j)$ for some link function $\kappa$. The goal is to recover the hidden vertex correspondence $\pi^*$ based on the observation of $A$ and $B$. We focus on the dot-product model with $\kappa(x,y)=\langle x, y \rangle$ and Euclidean distance model with $\kappa(x,y)=\|x-y\|^2$, in the low-dimensional regime of $d=o(\log n)$ wherein the underlying geometric structures are most evident. We derive an approximate maximum likelihood estimator, which provably achieves, with high probability, perfect recovery of $\pi^*$ when $\sigma=o(n^{-2/d})$ and almost perfect recovery with a vanishing fraction of errors when $\sigma=o(n^{-1/d})$. Furthermore, these conditions are shown to be information-theoretically optimal even when the latent coordinates $\{X_i\}$ and $\{Y_i\}$ are observed, complementing the recent results of [DCK19] and [KNW22] in geometric models of the planted bipartite matching problem. As a side discovery, we show that the celebrated spectral algorithm of [Ume88] emerges as a further approximation to the maximum likelihood in the geometric model.},

Our framework provably reduces the computational cost associated with evaluating the expensive forward maps stemming from various physical models. To demonstrate the versatility of our analysis, we discuss its implications for various methodologies including multilevel (accelerated, stochastic) gradient descent, a multilevel ensemble Kalman inversion and a multilevel Langevin sampler.

 abstract = {Dominated actions are natural (and perhaps the simplest possible) multi-agent generalizations of sub-optimal actions as in standard single-agent decision making. Thus similar to standard bandit learning, a basic learning question in multi-agent systems is whether agents can learn to efficiently eliminate all dominated actions in an unknown game if they can only observe noisy bandit feedback about the payoff of their played actions. Surprisingly, despite a seemingly simple task, we show a quite negative result; that is, standard no regret algorithms -- including the entire family of Dual Averaging algorithms -- provably take exponentially many rounds to eliminate all dominated actions. Moreover, algorithms with the stronger no swap regret also suffer similar exponential inefficiency. To overcome these barriers, we develop a new algorithm that adjusts Exp3 with Diminishing Historical rewards (termed Exp3-DH); Exp3-DH gradually forgets history at carefully tailored rates. We prove that when all agents run Exp3-DH (a.k.a., self-play in multi-agent learning), all dominated actions can be iteratively eliminated within polynomially many rounds. Our experimental results further demonstrate the efficiency of Exp3-DH, and that state-of-the-art bandit algorithms, even those developed specifically for learning in games, fail to eliminate all dominated actions efficiently.},

 abstract = {Understanding the fundamental principles behind the massive success of neural networks is one of the most important open questions in deep learning. However, due to the highly complex nature of the problem, progress has been relatively slow. In this note, through the lens of infinite-width networks, a.k.a. neural kernels, we present one such principle resulting from hierarchical localities. It is well-known that the eigenstructure of infinite-width multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) depends solely on the concept frequency, which measures the order of interactions. We show that the topologies from deep convolutional networks (CNNs) restructure the associated eigenspaces into finer subspaces. In addition to frequency, the new structure also depends on the concept space, which measures the spatial distance among nonlinear interaction terms. The resulting fine-grained eigenstructure dramatically improves the network's learnability, empowering them to simultaneously model a much richer class of interactions, including Long-Range-Low-Frequency interactions, Short-Range-High-Frequency interactions, and various interpolations and extrapolations in-between. Additionally, model scaling can improve the resolutions of interpolations and extrapolations and, therefore, the network's learnability. Finally, we prove a sharp characterization of the generalization error for infinite-width CNNs of any depth in the high-dimensional setting. Two corollaries follow: (1) infinite-width deep CNNs can break the curse of dimensionality without losing their expressivity, and (2) scaling improves performance in both the finite and infinite data regimes.},

In particular, when the function class contains $α$-smooth H{ö}lder functions, our rate of convergence is minimax optimal on the order of $N^{-\fracα{d+2α}}$.

 abstract = {Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning which gives rise to a rich class of computationally-challenging inference tasks. In this work, we focus on the canonical task of clustering d-dimensional Gaussian mixtures with unknown (and possibly degenerate) covariance. Recent works (Ghosh et al. '20; Mao, Wein '21; Davis, Diaz, Wang '21) have established lower bounds against the class of low-degree polynomial methods and the sum-of-squares (SoS) hierarchy for recovering certain hidden structures planted in Gaussian clustering instances. Prior work on many similar inference tasks portends that such lower bounds strongly suggest the presence of an inherent statistical-to-computational gap for clustering, that is, a parameter regime where the clustering task is statistically possible but no polynomial-time algorithm succeeds. One special case of the clustering task we consider is equivalent to the problem of finding a planted hypercube vector in an otherwise random subspace. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, this particular clustering model does not exhibit a statistical-to-computational gap, even though the aforementioned low-degree and SoS lower bounds continue to apply in this case. To achieve this, we give a polynomial-time algorithm based on the Lenstra--Lenstra--Lovasz lattice basis reduction method which achieves the statistically-optimal sample complexity of d+1 samples. This result extends the class of problems whose conjectured statistical-to-computational gaps can be "closed" by "brittle" polynomial-time algorithms, highlighting the crucial but subtle role of noise in the onset of statistical-to-computational gaps.},

Despite the recent efforts on relaxing these assumptions, existing works are only able to relax one of the two factors, leaving the strong assumption on the other factor intact. As an important open problem, can we achieve sample-efficient offline RL with weak assumptions on both factors? In this paper we answer the question in the positive. We analyze a simple algorithm based on the primal-dual formulation of MDPs, where the dual variables (discounted occupancy) are modeled using a density-ratio function against offline data. With proper regularization, we show that the algorithm enjoys polynomial sample complexity, under only realizability and single-policy concentrability. We also provide alternative analyses based on different assumptions to shed light on the nature of primal-dual algorithms for offline RL.},

We consider this question under the null model in which the points are i.i.d.  standard Gaussian vectors, focusing on the asymptotic regime in which $n,d\to\infty$, with $n/d\to\alpha\in (0,\infty)$, while $m$ is fixed. Denoting by $\cuF_{m, \alpha}$ the set of probability distributions in $\R^m$ that arise as low-dimensional projections in this limit, we establish new outer bounds on $\cuF_{m, \alpha}$. In particular, we characterize the radius of $\cuF_{m,\alpha}$ in terms of Wasserstein distance  and prove sharp bounds in terms of Kullback-Leibler divergence and RÃ©nyi information dimension. The previous question has application to unsupervised learning methods, such as projection pursuit and independent component analysis. We introduce a version of the same problem that is relevant for  supervised learning, and prove a sharp Wasserstein radius bound. As an application, we establish an upper bound on the interpolation threshold of two-layers neural networks with $m$ hidden neurons.},

More precisely, we give nonasymptotic expected $l^2$-distance bounds between the LSE and the true regression function, where expectation is evaluated on a fresh, counterfactual, trajectory. We leverage recently developed information-theoretic methods to establish the optimality of the LSE for nonparametric hypotheses classes in terms of supremum norm metric entropy and a subgaussian parameter. Next, we relate this subgaussian parameter to the stability of the underlying process using notions from dynamical systems theory. When combined, these developments lead to rate-optimal error bounds that scale as $T^{-1/(2+q)}$ for suitably stable processes and hypothesis classes with metric entropy growth of order $\delta^{-q}$. Here, $T$ is the length of the observed trajectory, $\delta \in \mathbb{R}_+$ is the packing granularity and $q\in (0,2)$ is a complexity term. Finally, we specialize our results to a number of scenarios of practical interest, such as Lipschitz dynamics, generalized linear models, and dynamics described by functions in certain classes of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS).},
