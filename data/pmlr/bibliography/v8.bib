 abstract = {Reliable estimation of the classification performance of learned predictive models is difficult, when working in the small sample setting. When dealing with biological data it is often the case that separate test data cannot be afforded. Cross-validation is in this case a typical strategy for estimating the performance. Recent results, further supported by experimental evidence presented in this article, show that many standard approaches to cross-validation suffer from extensive bias or variance when the area under ROC curve (AUC) is used as performance measure. We advocate the use of leave-pair-out cross-validation (LPOCV) for performance estimation, as it avoids many of these problems. A method previously proposed by us can be used to efficiently calculate this estimate for regularized least-squares (RLS) based learners.},

 abstract = {In this work we propose new ensemble methods for the hierarchical classification of gene functions. Our methods exploit the hierarchical relationships between the classes in different ways: each ensemble node is trained “locally”, according to its position in the hierarchy; moreover, in the evaluation phase the set of predicted annotations is built so to minimize a global loss function defined over the hierarchy. We also address the problem of sparsity of annotations by introducing a cost-sensitive parameter that allows to control the precision-recall trade-off. Experiments with the model organism S. cerevisiae, using the FunCat taxonomy and seven biomolecular data sets, reveal a significant advantage of our techniques over “flat” and cost-insensitive hierarchical ensembles.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v8-dzeroski10a,
 abstract = {Molecular biology and all the biomedical sciences are undergoing a true revolution as a result of the emergence and growing impact of a series of new disciplines and tools sharing the ’-omics’ suffix in their name. These include in particular genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, devoted respectively to the examination of the entire systems of genes, transcripts, proteins and metabolites present in a given cell or tissue type. The availability of these new, highly effective tools for biological exploration is dramatically changing the way one performs research in at least two respects. First, the amount of available experimental data is not a limiting factor any more; on the contrary, there is a plethora of it. Given the research question, the challenge has shifted towards identifying the relevant pieces of information and making sense out of it (a ’data mining’ issue). Second, rather than focus on components in isolation, we can now try to understand how biological systems behave as a result of the integration and interaction between the individual components that one can now monitor simultaneously, so called ’systems biology’. Machine learning naturally appears as one of the main drivers of progress in this context, where most of the targets of interest deal with complex structured objects: sequences, 2D and 3D structures or interaction networks. At the same time bioinformatics and systems biology have already induced significant new developments of general interest in machine learning, for example in the context of learning with structured data, graph inference, semisupervised learning, system identification, and novel combinations of optimization and learning algorithms. This volume contains extended versions of selected papers presented at the Third International Workshop on Machine Learning in Systems Biology (MLSB-2009), held in Ljubljana, Slovenia from September 5 to 6, 2009. The aim of the workshop was to contribute to the cross-fertilization between the research in machine learning methods and their applications to systems biology (i.e., complex biological and medical questions) by bringing together method developers and experimentalists. The technical program of the workshop consisted of 6 invited lectures, 12 oral presentations and 22 poster presentations. Invited lectures were given by Diego di Bernardo, Roman},

 abstract = {In a typical Genetic Association Study (GAS) several hundreds to millions of genomic variables are measured and tested for association with a given set of a phenotypic variables (e.g., a given disease state or a complete expression profile), with the aim of identifying the genetic background of complex, multifactorial diseases. These highly varying requirements resulted in a number of different statistical tools applying different approaches either bayesian or non-bayesian, model-based or conditional. In this paper we evaluate dedicated GAS tools and general purpose feature subset selection (FSS) tools including a Bayesian model-based tool BMLA in a GAS context. In the evaluation we used an artificial data set generated from a reference model with 113 genotypic variables that was based on a real-world genotype data.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v8-isik10a,
 abstract = {In this study, we combined the ChIP-seq and the transcriptome data and integrated these data into signaling cascades. Integration was realized through a framework based on data- and model-driven hybrid approach. An enrichment model was constructed to evaluate signaling cascades which resulted in specic cellular processes. We used ChIP-seq and microarray data from public databases which were obtained from HeLa cells under oxidative stress having similar experimental setups. Both ChIP-seq and array data were analyzed by percentile ranking for the sake of simultaneous data integration on specic genes. Signaling cascades from KEGG pathway database were subsequently scored by taking sum of the individual scores of the genes involved within the cascade. This scoring information is then transferred to en route of the signaling cascade to form the nal score. Signaling cascade model based framework that we describe in this study is a novel approach which calculates scores for the target process of the analyzed signaling cascade, rather than assigning scores to gene product nodes.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v8-mramor10a,
 abstract = {Machine learning methods that can use additional knowledge in their inference process are central to the development of integrative bioinformatics. Inclusion of background knowledge improves robustness, predictive accuracy and interpretability. Recently, a set of such techniques has been proposed that use information on gene sets for supervised data mining of class-labeled microarray data sets. We here present a new gene set-based supervised learning approach named SetSig and systematically investigate the predictive accuracy of this and other gene set approaches compared to the standard inference model where only gene expression information is used. Our results indicate that SetSig outperforms other gene set approaches, but contrary to earlier reports, transformation of gene expression data to the space of gene set signatures does not result in increased accuracy of predictive models when compared to those trained directly from original (not transformed) data.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v8-nadeem10a,
 abstract = {Data extracted from microarrays are now considered an important source of knowledge about various diseases. Several studies based on microarray data and the use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs have compared supervised machine learning approaches. These comparisons are based on classification schemes in which all samples are classified, regardless of the degree of confidence associated with the classification of a particular sample on the basis of a given classifier. In the domain of healthcare, it is safer to refrain from classifying a sample if the confidence assigned to the classification is not high enough, rather than classifying all samples even if confidence is low. We describe an approach in which the performance of different classifiers is compared, with the possibility of rejection, based on several reject areas. Using a tradeoff between accuracy and rejection, we propose the use of accuracy-rejection curves (ARCs) and three types of relationship between ARCs for comparisons of the ARCs of two classifiers. Empirical results based on purely synthetic data, semi-synthetic data (generated from real data obtained from patients) and public microarray data for binary classification problems demonstrate the efficacy of this method.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v8-saeys10a,
 abstract = {The scientic literature is a rich and challenging data source for research in systems biology, providing numerous interactions between biological entities. Text mining techniques have been increasingly useful to extract such information from the literature in an automatic way, but up to now the main focus of text mining in the systems biology eld has been restricted mostly to the discovery of protein-protein interactions. Here, we take this approach one step further, and use machine learning techniques combined with text mining to extract a much wider variety of interactions between biological entities. Each particular interaction type gives rise to a separate network, represented as a graph, all of which can be subsequently combined to yield a so-called integrated network representation. This provides a much broader view on the biological system as a whole, which can then be used in further investigations to analyse specic properties of the network.},
