  abstract = 	 {Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms that output prediction sets that have a  guarantee of marginal validity for finite samples with minimal distributional assumptions. This is a property that makes conformal predictors useful for machine learning tasks where we  require reliable predictions. It would also be desirable to achieve conditional validity in the same  setting, in the sense that validity of the prediction intervals remains true regardless of conditioning  on any particular property of the object of the prediction. Unfortunately, it has been shown that  such conditional validity is impossible to guarantee for non-trivial prediction problems for finite  samples. In this article, instead of trying to achieve a strong conditional validity guarantee, an  \emph{approximation} to conditional validity is considered and measured empirically. A new algorithm is  introduced to do this by iteratively adjusting a conformity measure to deviations from object  conditional validity measured in the training data. Experimental results are provided for three data  sets that demonstrate (1) in real world machine learning tasks, lack of conditional validity is a  measurable problem and (2) that the proposed algorithm is effective at alleviating this problem.}

An approach to further increasing the  flexibility of the framework is proposed, called \emph{Mondrian conformal predictive distributions}, which  are (standard or normalized) conformal predictive distributions formed from multiple Mondrian  categories. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with an application to regression  forests. By forming categories through binning of the predictions, it is shown that for this model  class, the use of Mondrian conformal predictive distributions significantly outperforms the use of  both standard and normalized conformal predictive distributions with respect to the continuous- ranked probability score. It is further shown that the use of Mondrian conformal predictive  distributions results in as tight prediction intervals as produced by normalized conformal regressors,  while improving upon the point predictions of the underlying regression forest.}

To compute these values efficiently and exactly we employ a standard algorithm based on  nearest neighbor classification and propose a variant of this algorithm for clustered data.

In pursuit of this connection we explicitly define Mahalanobis distance as a potential conformity  score in full conformal prediction.

We introduce synergy conformal prediction which is an  ensemble method that combines monotonic conformity scores, and is capable of producing valid  prediction intervals. We study the applicability in three scenarios; where data is partitioned, where  an ensemble of different machine learning methods is used, and where data is unpartitioned. We  evaluate the method on 10 data sets and show that the synergy conformal predictor produces valid  prediction intervals that on partitioned data performs well compared to the most efficient model  trained on individual partitions, making it a viable approach for federated settings when data cannot  be pooled. We also show that our method has advantages over current ensembles of conformal  predictors by producing valid and efficient results on unpartitioned data, and that it is less  computationally demanding.}

While almost all machine learning algorithms are able to produce probability estimates, these are  often poorly calibrated, thus requiring external calibration. For multiclass problems, external  calibration has typically been done using one-vs-all or all-vs-all schemes, thus adding to the  computational complexity, but also making it impossible to analyze and inspect the predictive  models. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for calibrating inherently multi-class models.  Instead of providing a probability distribution over all labels, the estimation is of the probability that  the class label predicted by the underlying model is correct. In an extensive empirical study, it is  shown that the suggested approach, when applied to both Platt scaling and Venn-Abers, is able to  improve the probability estimates from decision trees, random forests and extreme gradient  boosting.}

However, this property is achieved at a price  of reduction in precision. In the case of conformal classification, the system can output multiple class  labels instead of one. It is also known, that the choice of nonconformity function has a major impact  on the efficiency of conformal classifiers. Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic  nonconformity functions result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural  Network-based conformal classifier, the \emph{inverse probability} (or hinge loss) allows minimizing the  average number of predicted labels, and \emph{margin} results in a larger fraction of singleton predictions.  In this work, we aim to further extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8  different classification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship holds or  not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the properties of these two  nonconformity functions.}

In the present study, the estimation of metastasis in prostate patients after primary treatments (radical prostatectomy) with the aid of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conformal Predictors (CP) was evaluated. We show that the use of ML models can complement classical statistical approaches. Moreover, the application of CP, on top of an underlying ML model, renders a probabilistic outcome that combines the simplicity of a clinical indicator with the precision of a ML approach. The TriNetX Research Network, an electronic health records database with datasets from several United States health care organizations, was used in this study.

  abstract = 	 {Conformal prediction provides a way of testing the IID assumption, which is the standard  assumption in machine learning. A natural question is whether this way of testing is efficient. A  typical situation where the IID assumption is broken is the existence of a changepoint at which the  distribution of the data changes. We study the case of a change from one continuous distribution to  another with both distributions belonging to standard parametric families. Our conclusion is that the  conformal approach to testing the IID assumption is efficient, at least to some degree.}

Traditionally, conformal prediction requires retraining multiple leave-one-out classifiers to calculate  p-values for each test point. By using influence functions, we are able to approximate this procedure  and to speed up considerably the time complexity.}
