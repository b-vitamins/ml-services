 abstract = {The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy rate makes this  framework attractive in various practical applications. However, this property is achieved at a price  of reduction in precision. In the case of conformal classification, the system can output multiple class  labels instead of one. It is also known, that the choice of nonconformity function has a major impact  on the efficiency of conformal classifiers. Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic  nonconformity functions result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural  Network-based conformal classifier, the \emph{inverse probability} (or hinge loss) allows minimizing the  average number of predicted labels, and \emph{margin} results in a larger fraction of singleton predictions.  In this work, we aim to further extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8  different classification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship holds or  not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the properties of these two  nonconformity functions.},

 abstract = {Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms that output prediction sets that have a guarantee of marginal validity for finite samples with minimal distributional assumptions. This is a property that makes conformal predictors useful for machine learning tasks where we require reliable predictions. It would also be desirable to achieve conditional validity in the same setting, in the sense that validity of the prediction intervals remains valid regardless of conditioning on any particular property of the object of the prediction. Unfortunately, it has been shown that such conditional validity is impossible to guarantee for non-trivial prediction problems for finite samples. In this article, instead of trying to achieve a strong conditional validity result, the weaker goal of achieving an approximation to conditional validity is considered. A new algorithm is introduced to do this by iteratively adjusting a conformity measure to deviations from object conditional validity measured in the training data. Along with some theoretical results, experimental results are provided for three data sets that demonstrate (1) in real world machine learning tasks, lack of conditional validity is a measurable problem and (2) that the proposed algorithm is effective at alleviating this problem.},

An approach to further increasing the  flexibility of the framework is proposed, called \emph{Mondrian conformal predictive distributions}, which  are (standard or normalized) conformal predictive distributions formed from multiple Mondrian  categories. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with an application to regression  forests. By forming categories through binning of the predictions, it is shown that for this model  class, the use of Mondrian conformal predictive distributions significantly outperforms the use of  both standard and normalized conformal predictive distributions with respect to the continuous- ranked probability score. It is further shown that the use of Mondrian conformal predictive  distributions results in as tight prediction intervals as produced by normalized conformal regressors,  while improving upon the point predictions of the underlying regression forest.},

 abstract = {Prostate cancer is among the most common type of cancer in men worldwide. Despite the use of clinical indicators, as part of simple rule-based strategies, stratifying patients diagnosed with prostate cancer into risk groups to reliably reflect oncological prognosis remains challenging. Machine Learning (ML) offers the possibility to develop estimation models based on routinely evaluated patient or tumor characteristics. In the present study, the estimation of metastasis in prostate patients after primary treatments (radical prostatectomy) with the aid of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conformal Predictors (CP) was evaluated. We show that the use of ML models can complement classical statistical approaches. Moreover, the application of CP, on top of an underlying ML model, renders a probabilistic outcome that combines the simplicity of a clinical indicator with the precision of a ML approach. The TriNetX Research Network, an electronic health records database with datasets from several United States health care organizations, was used in this study. This approach can be further adapted to support clinical decision making in prostate and other types of cancer.},

Therefore, a reliable and fast detection of the  point at which a CD occurs, allows effective retraining of the model to recover accuracy.

These features are essential for numerous real-world applications. For example, in  those cases when PD is used for sensitive tasks, like plagiarism detection, hate speech recognition or  in medical NLP, mistakes might be very costly.

Both  variants are used for computing Shapley conformity scores for inductive conformal predictors. The  experiments show that the Shapley-value conformity scores result in smaller prediction sets for  significance level $\epsilon \leq 0.1$ compared with those produced by standard conformity scores  (i.e. similarity between true and predicted output values).},

 abstract = {Predictive models communicating algorithmic confidence are very informative, but only  if well-calibrated and sharp, i.e., providing accurate probability estimates adjusted for each instance.  While almost all machine learning algorithms are able to produce probability estimates, these are  often poorly calibrated, thus requiring external calibration. For multiclass problems, external  calibration has typically been done using one-vs-all or all-vs-all schemes, thus adding to the  computational complexity, but also making it impossible to analyze and inspect the predictive  models. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for calibrating inherently multi-class models.  Instead of providing a probability distribution over all labels, the estimation is of the probability that  the class label predicted by the underlying model is correct. In an extensive empirical study, it is  shown that the suggested approach, when applied to both Platt scaling and Venn-Abers, is able to  improve the probability estimates from decision trees, random forests and extreme gradient  boosting.},

Such model will be able to estimate how long a given tool is likely to last, in order  to improve performance and productivity. This work is part of the KTP project between Parafix and  University of Brighton.},
