  abstract = 	 {The majority of data science and machine learning tutorials focus on generating models: assembling a dataset; splitting the data into training, validation, and testing subsets; building the model; and demonstrating its generalizability. But when itâs time to repeat the analogous steps when using the model in production, issues of high latency or low throughput can arise. To an end user, the cost of too much time spent featurizing raw data and evaluating a model over features can wind up erasing any gains a smarter prediction can offer. Exposing concurrency in these model-usage steps, and then capitalizing on that concurrency, can improve throughput. This paper describes how the actor framework can be used to bring a predictive model to a real-time setting. Two case-study examples are described: a live deployment built for the freelancing platform Upwork, a simple text classifier with accompanying code for use as an introductory project.}

  abstract = 	 {Diversity in machine learning APIs (in both software toolkits and web services), works against realising machine learningâs full potential, making it difficult to draw on individual algorithms from different products or to compose multiple algorithms to solve complex tasks. This paper introduces the Protocols and Structures for Inference (PSI) service architecture and specification, which presents inferential entitiesârelations, attributes, learners and predictorsâas RESTful web resources that are accessible via a common but flexible and extensible interface. Resources describe the data they ingest or emit using a variant of the JSON schema language, and the API has mechanisms to support non-JSON data and future extension of service features.}
