These include (a) Collaboration (b) Versioning (c) Graphical authoring(d) Push button operationalization and (e) Monetization. We outline the design principles, system design and lessons learned in building such a system.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v50-gawalt15,
 abstract = {The majority of data science and machine learning tutorials focus on generating models: assembling a dataset; splitting the data into training, validation, and testing subsets; building the model; and demonstrating its generalizability. But when itâs time to repeat the analogous steps when using the model in production, issues of high latency or low throughput can arise. To an end user, the cost of too much time spent featurizing raw data and evaluating a model over features can wind up erasing any gains a smarter prediction can offer. Exposing concurrency in these model-usage steps, and then capitalizing on that concurrency, can improve throughput. This paper describes how the actor framework can be used to bring a predictive model to a real-time setting. Two case-study examples are described: a live deployment built for the freelancing platform Upwork, a simple text classifier with accompanying code for use as an introductory project.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v50-montgomery15,
 abstract = {Diversity in machine learning APIs (in both software toolkits and web services), works against
realising machine learning’s full potential, making it difficult to draw on individual algorithms
from different products or to compose multiple algorithms to solve complex tasks. This paper
introduces the Protocols and Structures for Inference (PSI) service architecture and specification,
which presents inferential entities - relations, attributes, learners and predictors - as RESTful
web resources that are accessible via a common but flexible and extensible interface. Resources
describe the data they ingest or emit using a variant of the JSON schema language, and the API
has mechanisms to support non-JSON data and future extension of service features.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v50-preface,
 abstract = {Fractional calculus has gained considerable popularity and importance during the past three decades mainly because of its demonstrated applications in numerous seemingly diverse and widespread fields of science and engineering. The chapter presents results, including the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the Cauchy Type and Cauchy problems involving nonlinear ordinary fractional differential equations, explicit solutions of linear differential equations and of the corresponding initial-value problems by their reduction to Volterra integral equations and by using operational and compositional methods; applications of the one-and multidimensional Laplace, Mellin, and Fourier integral transforms in deriving the closed-form solutions of ordinary and partial differential equations; and a theory of the so-called “sequential linear fractional differential equations,” including a generalization of the classical Frobenius method.},
