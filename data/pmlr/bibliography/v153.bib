The resulting more general algorithm works in essentially the same way as before, but on a larger class of context-free languages. }

  abstract = 	 {Work on the learnability of tier-based string-to-string functions has so far been limited to those that operate over a single tier. Such functions are, however, generally incapable of modelling multiple simultaneous processes. It is relatively easy to define a class of multi-tiered functions that can handle more than one process at a time, but doing so has negative consequences for learnability. Namely, we conjecture that it is difficult if not impossible to efficiently learn any arbitrary set of tiers from positive data alone. We thus describe the <em>strongly target-specified</em> subclass of multi-tiered functions, whose tiers can be efficiently identified from positive data. In these functions, each input element is associated with a single tier that on its own can fully determine what the element is mapped to. When the tiers act independently in this way, we can learn them in isolation from each other. A transducer representation of the target function can then be constructed using the discovered tiers.}

Two learning algorithms for $\TSL{}$ already exist: one by Jardine and Heinz (2016) and one by Jardine and McMullin (2017). The former is limited in that it cannot learn all $\TSL{}$ patterns. The latter is restricted to a batch-learning environment. We present a general algorithm without these limitations. In particular we show that $\TSL{}$ is efficiently learnable online via reinterpretation of a strictly local grammar, and this mechanism generalizes to the strictly piecewise class as well. However we note that the known $\TSL{}$ learning algorithms are not robust in the face of interaction with other constraints, posing a challenge for the utility of this class for phonotactics.}

The objective is to obtain a weighted finite automaton (WFA) that fits within a given size constraint and which mimics the behaviour of the original model while minimizing some notion of distance between the black box and the extracted WFA. We provide an algorithm for the approximate minimization of black boxes trained for language modelling of sequential data over a one-letter alphabet. By reformulating the problem in terms of Hankel matrices, we leverage classical results on the approximation of Hankel operators, namely the celebrated Adamyan-Arov-Krein (AAK) theory. This allows us to use the spectral norm to measure the distance between the black box and the WFA. We provide theoretical guarantees to study the potentially infinite-rank Hankel matrix of the black box, without accessing the training data, and we prove that our method returns an asymptotically-optimal approximation.}

  abstract = 	 {Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequence modeling, generation, and prediction. Despite success in applications such as machine translation and voice recognition, these stateful models have several critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs struggle to recognize very long sequences, which limits their applicability in many important temporal processing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in recognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), unable to reach 100% accuracy on the training set. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an external, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However, differentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on complex CFLs nor tested on very long sequences that have been seen on training. In fact, earlier work has shown that continuous differentiable memory structures struggle in recognizing complex CFLs over very long sequences. In this paper, we improve the memory-augmented RNN with new architectural and state updating mechanisms that learn to properly balance the use of latent states with external memory. Our improved RNN models exhibit improved generalization and are able to classify long strings generated by complex hierarchical context free grammars (CFGs). We evaluate our models on CFGs, including the Dyck languages, as well as on the Penn Treebank language modelling dataset,  achieving stable, robust performance on these benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that our proposed memory-augmented networks are able retain information over long sequences leading to improved generalization for strings up to length $160$.}

  abstract = 	 {Artificial neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and transformers, have empirically demonstrated impressive performance across many natural language processing tasks. However, automated text processing at a deeper and more interpretable level arguably requires extracting intricate patterns such as underlying grammatical structures. As a result, correctly interpreting a neural language model would require an understanding of linguistic structure through formal language theory. Nonetheless, there is often a discrepancy between theoretical and practical findings that restrict models informed by formal language theory in real-life scenarios. For instance, while learning context-free grammars (CFGs), existing neural models fall short because they lack appropriate memory structures. In this work, we investigate how learning algorithms affect the generalization ability of RNNs that are designed to learn context-free languages (CFGs) as well as their ability to encode hierarchical representations. To do so, we investigate a range of learning algorithms on complex, context-free languages such as the Dyck languages, with a focus on the RNNâs ability to generalize to longer sequences when processing a CFG. Our results demonstrate that a Long Short-term memory (LSTM) RNN equipped with second-order connections, trained with the sparse attentive backtracking (SAB) algorithm, performs stably across various Dyck languages and successfully emulates real-time-counter machines. We empirically show that RNNs without external memory are incapable of recognizing Dyck-2 languages, which require a stack-like structure. We finally investigate each learning algorithmâs performance on real-world language modeling tasks using the Penn Tree Bank and text8 benchmarks. We further investigate how an increase in model parameters affects each RNNâs stability and grammar recognition performance when trained using different learning algorithms.}

These methods typically operate by learning a representation of the target DFA either as a partitioning the states of a prefix tree acceptor or as an encoding of its transition matrix. In this paper, we present an alternative approach for learning random DFAs over binary alphabets from sparse training data. We first conducted several experiments on thousands of problem instances to study their behaviour and to better understand the conditions under which state merging algorithms succeed or fail. Motivated by these observations, we implemented an evolutionary algorithm in which the chromosomes encode short sequences of merges selected from a subset of high state-reduction merges. The fitness of a chromosome is then measured by extending it using the EDSM heuristic and the size of the final hypothesis is used to score the entire sequence. To improve runtime performance, we use a method that can reliably estimate the fitness of a sequence of merges without extending it completely. We use the state-of-the-art EDSM algorithm as a baseline to compare our results to and observe that we can find low-error hypotheses or the exact target DFAs with a considerably higher likelihood.}
