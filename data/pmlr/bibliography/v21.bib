  abstract = 	 {Using a well-known industrial case study from the verification literature, the bounded retransmission protocol, we show how active learning can be used to establish the correctness of protocol implementation I relative to a given reference implementation R.  Using active learning, we learn a model M_R of reference implementation R, which serves as input for a model based testing tool that checks conformance of implementation I to M_R.  In addition, we also explore an alternative approach in which we learn a model M_I of implementation I, which is compared to model M_R using an equivalence checker.  Our work uses a unique combination of software tools for model construction (Uppaal), active learning (LearnLib, Tomte), model-based testing (JTorX, TorXakis) and verification (CADP, MRMC).  We show how these tools can be used for learning these models, analyzing the obtained results, and improving the learning performance.}

Learnability of these models has been well studied when the sample is given in batch mode, and algorithms with PAC-like learning guarantees exist for specific classes of models such as Probabilistic Deterministic Finite Automata (PDFA).  Here we focus on PDFA and give an algorithm for infering models in this class under the stringent \emphdata stream scenario: unlike existing methods, our algorithm works incrementally and in one pass, uses memory sublinear in the stream length, and processes input items in amortized constant time.  We provide rigorous PAC-like bounds for all of the above, as well as an evaluation on synthetic data showing that the algorithm performs well in practice.  Our algorithm makes a key usage of several old and new sketching techniques.  In particular, we develop a new sketch for implementing bootstrapping in a streaming setting which may be of independent interest.  In experiments we have observed that this sketch yields important reductions in the examples required for performing some crucial statistical tests in our algorithm.}

In this paper we extend distributional learning to the class of parallel multiple context-free grammars, a class which as far as is known includes all attested natural languages, even taking an extreme view on these examples.  These grammars may have a copying operation that can recursively copy constituents, allowing them to generate non-semilinear languages.  We generalise the notion of a context to a class of functions that include copying operations.  The congruential approach is ineffective at this level of the hierarchy; accordingly we extend this using dual approaches, defining nonterminals using sets of these generalised contexts.  As a corollary we also extend the multiple context free grammars using the lattice based approaches.}

Protein annotation is a task of first importance with respect to these banks.  It consists of retrieving the genes that code for proteins within the sequences and then predict the function of these new proteins in the cell by comparison with known families.  Many methods have been designed to characterize protein families and discover new members, mainly based on subsets of regular expressions or simple Hidden Markov Models.  We are interested in more expressive models that are able to capture the long-range characteristic interactions occurring in the spatial structure of the analyzed protein family. Starting from the work of Clark and Eyraud (2007) and Yoshinaka (2008) on inference of substitutable and \emphk,l-substitutable languages respectively, we introduce new classes of substitutable languages using local rather than global substitutability, a reasonable assumption with respect to protein structures to enhance inductive leaps performed by least generalized generalization approaches. The concepts are illustrated on a first experiment using a real proteic sequence set.}

Unfortunately, local search methods tend to get caught in local optima, even with random restarts.  Two approaches are outlined that try to avoid this problem.  One uses branch-and-bound methods from mathematical programming to eliminate regions of parameter space that cannot contain the global optimum.  The other is inspired by recent work on deep learning, and uses spectral methods to build up featural representations of all substrings, without premature commitment to which substrings are constituents.}

This allows us to introduce a new kind of graph grammars, using a face-replacement mechanism. To learn them, we extend recent successful techniques developed for string grammars, and based on a property on target languages: the substitutability property.  We show how this property can be extended to plane graph languages and finally state the first identification in the limit result for a class of graph grammars, as far as we know.}

By introducing variables and  substitutions, we can deal with the difficulty of preparing  production rules in generative grammar and of representing  context-sensitivity with them.  Our key idea is to regard sequences  of substitutions as generations of strings, and to give probabilities  of substitutions like PCFG.  In this study, after giving a problem to  estimate a probability mass function from strings based on our  formalization, we solve it by the Passing algorithm that runs in an  iterative manner.

  abstract = 	 {Modern grammar induction systems often employ curriculum learning strategies that begin by training on a subset of all available input that is considered simpler than the full data.  Traditionally, filtering has been at granularities of whole input units, e.g., discarding entire sentences with too many words or punctuation marks. We propose instead viewing inter-punctuation fragments as atoms, initially, thus making some simple phrases and clauses of complex sentences available to training sooner.  Splitting input text at punctuation in this way improved our state-of-the-art grammar induction pipeline.  We observe that resulting partial data, i.e., mostly incomplete sentence fragments, can be analyzed using reduced parsing models which, we show, can be easier to bootstrap than more nuanced grammars.  Starting with a new, bare dependency-and-boundary model (DBM-0), our grammar inducer attained 61.2% directed dependency accuracy on Section 23 (all sentences) of the Wall Street Journal corpus: more than 2% higher than previous published results for this task.}

  abstract = 	 {This paper reviews the development of active learning in the last decade under the perspective of treating of data, a major source of undecidability, and therefore a key problem to achieve practicality. Starting with the first case studies, in which data was completely disregarded, we revisit different steps towards dealing with data explicitly in active learning: We discuss Mealy Machines as a model for systems with (data) output, automated alphabet abstraction refinement as a two-dimensional extension of the partition-refinement based approach of active learning for inferring not only states but also optimal alphabet abstractions, and Register Mealy Machines, which can be regarded as programs restricted to data-independent data processing as it is typical for protocols or interface programs. We are convinced that this development has the potential to transform active automata learning into a technology of high practical importance.}

The language of protein sequence can be described by using a formal system such as fuzzy context-free grammar, and the problem of amyloidogenic region recognition can be replaced by fuzzy grammar induction.  The induced fuzzy grammar achieved 70.6% accuracy and 96.7% specificity on a recently published amyloidogenic dataset.  Our results are comparable to other methods dedicated to recognize amyloid proteins.}

For each of these choices, a separate   classifier is trained.  Each classifier learns the boundaries   between different languages, which each correspond to a particular   class.

Several finite-state learning algorithms use state-merging as their underlying technique and a collection of grammatical inference algorithms that aim to learn context-free grammars build on the concept of substitutability to identify potential grammar rules. When learning context-free grammars, there are essentially two approaches: model merging, which generalizes with more data, and model splitting, which specializes with more data.  Both approaches can be combined sequentially in a generic framework.  In this article, we investigate the impact of different approaches within the first phase of the framework on system performance.}
