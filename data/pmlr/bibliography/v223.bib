 abstract = {While economic theory explains the linkages among the financial markets of different countries, empirical studies mainly verify the linkages through Granger causality, without considering latent variables or instantaneous effects. Their findings are inconsistent regarding the existence of causal linkages among financial markets, which might be attributed to differences in the focused markets, data periods, and methods applied. Our study adopts causal discovery methods including VAR-LiNGAM and LPCMCI with domain knowledge to explore the linkages among financial markets in Japan and the United States (US) for the post Covid-19 pandemic period under divergent monetary policy directions. The VAR-LiNGAM results reveal that the previous day's US market influences the following day's Japanese market for both stocks and bonds, and the bond markets of the previous day impact the following day's foreign exchange (FX) market directly and the following day's Japanese stock market indirectly. The LPCMCI results indicate the existence of potential latent confounders. Our results demonstrate that VAR-LiNGAM uniquely identifies the directed acyclic graph (DAG), and thus provides informative insight into the causal relationship when the assumptions are considered valid. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the linkages among financial markets in the analyzed data period by supporting the existence of linkages between Japan and the US for the same financial markets and among FX, stock, and bond markets, thus highlighting the importance of leveraging causal discovery methods in the financial domain.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v223-kikuchi23a,
 abstract = {Learning causal structures from observational data
has recently attracted considerable
attention.Although many studies have focused on
uncovering the connections between scalar random
variables,estimation algorithms for groups of
variablesâparticularly for multiple groups of
variablesâremain scarce.This paper proposes a
novel differentiable algebraic constraint that can
be used along with existing continuous
optimization-based structure-learning algorithms to
learn the causal relationships among groups of
variables.Considering the complex functional
relationships among variables in real-world
scenarios, we propose a structure-learning algorithm
for nonlinear time-series data with location-scale
noise.Experimental results for synthetic and
real-world data indicate that the proposed group
acyclicity constraint significantly increases the
estimation accuracy for the causal relationship
among the groups of variables and verify the
effectiveness of the proposed structure-learning
algorithm.},

 abstract = {We give novel Python and R interfaces for the (Java) Tetrad project for causal modeling, search, and estimation. The Tetrad project is a mainstay in the literature, having been under consistent development for over 30 years. Some of its algorithms are now classics, like PC and FCI; others are recent developments. It is increasingly the case, however, that researchers need to access the underlying Java code from Python or R. Existing methods for doing this are inadequate. We provide new, up-to-date methods using the JPype Python-Java interface and the Reticulate Python-R interface, directly solving these issues. With the addition of some simple tools and the provision of working examples for both Python and R, using JPype and Reticulate to interface Python and R with Tetrad is straightforward and intuitive.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v223-rawls23a,
 abstract = {Here we advance a new approach for measuring EEG
causal oscillatory connectivity, capitalizing on
recent advances in causal discovery analysis for
skewed time series data and in spectral
parameterization of time-frequency (TF) data. We
first parameterize EEG TF data into separate
oscillatory and aperiodic components. We then
measure causal interactions between separated
oscillatory data with the recently proposed causal
connectivity method Greedy Adjacencies and
Non-Gaussian Orientations (GANGO). We apply GANGO to
contemporaneous time series, then we extend the
GANGO method to lagged data that control for
temporal autocorrelation. We apply this approach to
EEG data acquired in the context of a clinical trial
investigating noninvasive transcranial direct
current stimulation to treat executive dysfunction
following mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). First,
we analyze whole-scalp oscillatory connectivity
patterns using community detection. Then we
demonstrate that tDCS increases the effect size of
causal theta-band oscillatory connections between
prefrontal sensors and the rest of the scalp, while
simultaneously decreasing causal alpha-band
oscillatory connections between prefrontal sensors
and the rest of the scalp. Improved executive
functioning following tDCS could result from
increased prefrontal causal theta oscillatory
influence, and decreased prefrontal alpha-band
causal oscillatory influence.},
