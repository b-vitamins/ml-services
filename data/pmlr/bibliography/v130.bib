 abstract = {Logistic Bandits have recently attracted substantial attention, by providing an uncluttered yet challenging framework for understanding the impact of non-linearity in parametrized bandits. It was shown by Faury et al. (2020) that the learning-theoretic difficulties of Logistic Bandits can be embodied by a large (sometimes prohibitively) problem-dependent constant $κ$, characterizing the magnitude of the reward's non-linearity. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm for which we provide a refined analysis. This allows for a better characterization of the effect of non-linearity and yields improved problem-dependent guarantees. In most favorable cases this leads to a regret upper-bound scaling as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T/κ})$, which dramatically improves over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T}+κ)$ state-of-the-art guarantees. We prove that this rate is minimax-optimal by deriving a $Ω(d\sqrt{T/κ})$ problem-dependent lower-bound. Our analysis identifies two regimes (permanent and transitory) of the regret, which ultimately re-conciliates Faury et al. (2020) with the Bayesian approach of Dong et al. (2019). In contrast to previous works, we find that in the permanent regime non-linearity can dramatically ease the exploration-exploitation trade-off. While it also impacts the length of the transitory phase in a problem-dependent fashion, we show that this impact is mild in most reasonable configurations.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we learn dynamics models for parametrized families of dynamical systems with varying properties. The dynamics models are formulated as stochastic processes conditioned on a latent context variable which is inferred from observed transitions of the respective system. The probabilistic formulation allows us to compute an action sequence which, for a limited number of environment interactions, optimally explores the given system within the parametrized family. This is achieved by steering the system through transitions being most informative for the context variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for exploration on a non-linear toy-problem and two well-known reinforcement learning environments.},

 abstract = { We introduce Dirichlet pruning, a novel post-processing technique to transform a large neural network model into a compressed one. Dirichlet pruning is a form of structured pruning which assigns the Dirichlet distribution over each layerâs channels in convolutional layers (or neurons in fully-connected layers), and learns the parameters of the distribution over these units using variational inference. The learnt parameters allow us to informatively and intuitively remove unimportant units, resulting in a compact architecture containing only crucial features for a task at hand. This method yields low GPU footprint, as the number of parameters is linear in the number of channels (or neurons) and training requires as little as one epoch to converge. We perform extensive experiments, in particular on larger architectures such as VGG and WideResNet (94% and 72% compression rate, respectively) where our method achieves the state-of-the-art compression performance and provides interpretable features as a by-product. },

 abstract = { Modeling joint probability distributions over sequences has been studied from many perspectives. The physics community developed matrix product states, a tensor-train decomposition for probabilistic modeling, motivated by the need to tractably model many-body systems. But similar models have also been studied in the stochastic processes and weighted automata literature, with little work on how these bodies of work relate to each other. We address this gap by showing how stationary or uniform versions of popular quantum tensor network models have equivalent representations in the stochastic processes and weighted automata literature, in the limit of infinitely long sequences. We demonstrate several equivalence results between models used in these three communities: (i) uniform variants of matrix product states, Born machines and locally purified states from the quantum tensor networks literature, (ii) predictive state representations, hidden Markov models, norm-observable operator models and hidden quantum Markov models from the stochastic process literature, and (iii) stochastic weighted automata, probabilistic automata and quadratic automata from the formal languages literature. Such connections may open the door for results and methods developed in one area to be applied in another. },

In Ahuja et al., it was shown that solving for the Nash equilibria of a new class of "ensemble-games" is equivalent to solving IRM. In this work, we extend the framework in Ahuja et al. for linear regressions by projecting the ensemble-game on an $\ell_{\infty}$ ball. We show that such projections help achieve non-trivial OOD guarantees despite not achieving perfect invariance. For linear models with confounders, we prove that Nash equilibria of these games are closer to the ideal OOD solutions than the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) and we also provide learning algorithms that provably converge to these Nash Equilibria. Empirical comparisons of the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art show consistent gains in achieving OOD solutions in several settings involving anti-causal variables and confounders.},

 abstract = {Quantizing large Neural Networks (NN) while maintaining the performance is highly desirable for resource-limited devices due to reduced memory and time complexity. It is usually formulated as a constrained optimization problem and optimized via a modified version of gradient descent. In this work, by interpreting the continuous parameters (unconstrained) as the dual of the quantized ones, we introduce a Mirror Descent (MD) framework for NN quantization. Specifically, we provide conditions on the projections (i.e., mapping from continuous to quantized ones) which would enable us to derive valid mirror maps and in turn the respective MD updates. Furthermore, we present a numerically stable implementation of MD that requires storing an additional set of auxiliary variables (unconstrained), and show that it is strikingly analogous to the Straight Through Estimator (STE) based method which is typically viewed as a trick to avoid vanishing gradients issue. Our experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet classification datasets with VGG-16, ResNet-18, and MobileNetV2 architectures show that our MD variants obtain quantized networks with state-of-the-art performance.

 abstract = {We introduce the probabilistic sequential matrix factorization (PSMF) method for factorizing time-varying and non-stationary datasets consisting of high-dimensional time-series. In particular, we consider nonlinear Gaussian state-space models where sequential approximate inference results in the factorization of a data matrix into a dictionary and time-varying coefficients with potentially nonlinear Markovian dependencies. The assumed Markovian structure on the coefficients enables us to encode temporal dependencies into a low-dimensional feature space. The proposed inference method is solely based on an approximate extended Kalman filtering scheme, which makes the resulting method particularly efficient. PSMF can account for temporal nonlinearities and, more importantly, can be used to calibrate and estimate generic differentiable nonlinear subspace models. We also introduce a robust version of PSMF, called rPSMF, which uses Student-t filters to handle model misspecification. We show that PSMF can be used in multiple contexts: modeling time series with a periodic subspace, robustifying changepoint detection methods, and imputing missing data in several high-dimensional time-series, such as measurements of pollutants across London.},

Motivated by use-cases in personalized federated learning, we study the often overlooked aspect of the modern meta-learning algorithms -- their data efficiency. To shed more light on which methods are more efficient, we use techniques from algorithmic stability to derive bounds on the transfer risk that have important practical implications, indicating how much supervision is needed and how it must be allocated for each method to attain the desired level of generalization. Further, we introduce a new simple framework for evaluating meta-learning methods under a limit on the available supervision, conduct an empirical study of MAML, Reptile, and Protonets, and demonstrate the differences in the behavior of these methods on few-shot and federated learning benchmarks. Finally, we propose active meta-learning, which incorporates active data selection into learning-to-learn, leading to better performance of all methods in the limited supervision regime.},

However, it is still a major question whether we could use a similar approach to learn superior auditory representations. In this paper, we expand on prior work (SimCLR) to learn better auditory representations. We (1) introduce various data augmentations suitable for auditory data and evaluate their impact on predictive performance, (2) show that training with time-frequency audio features substantially improves the quality of the learned representations compared to raw signals, and (3) demonstrate that training with both supervised and contrastive losses simultaneously improves the learned representations compared to self-supervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning. We illustrate that by combining all these methods and with substantially less labeled data, our framework (CLAR) achieves significant improvement on prediction performance compared to supervised approach. Moreover, compared to self-supervised approach, our framework converges faster with significantly better representations.},

 abstract = {Stochastic variational inference offers an attractive option as a default method for differentiable probabilistic programming. However, the performance of the variational approach depends on the choice of an appropriate variational family. Here, we introduce automatic structured variational inference (ASVI), a fully automated method for constructing structured variational families, inspired by the closed-form update in conjugate Bayesian models. These pseudo-conjugate families incorporate the forward pass of the input probabilistic program and can therefore capture complex statistical dependencies. Pseudo-conjugate families have the same space and time complexity of the input probabilistic program and are therefore tractable for a very large family of models including both continuous and discrete variables. We validate our automatic variational method on a wide range of both low- and high-dimensional inference problems. We find that ASVI provides a clear improvement in performance when compared with other popular approaches such as mean field family and inverse autoregressive flows. We provide a fully automatic open source implementation of ASVI in TensorFlow Probability.},

@inproceedings{pmlr-v130-anagnostides21a,
 abstract = {This work provides several new insights on the robustness of Kearns' statistical query framework against challenging label-noise models. First, we build on a recent result by \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2006-04787} that showed noise tolerance of distribution-independently evolvable concept classes under Massart noise. Specifically, we extend their characterization to more general noise models, including the Tsybakov model which considerably generalizes the Massart condition by allowing the flipping probability to be arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{2}$ for a subset of the domain. As a corollary, we employ an evolutionary algorithm by \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/KanadeVV10} to obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with arbitrarily small excess error for learning linear threshold functions over any spherically symmetric distribution in the presence of spherically symmetric Tsybakov noise. Moreover, we posit access to a stronger oracle, in which for every labeled example we additionally obtain its flipping probability. In this model, we show that every SQ learnable class admits an efficient learning algorithm with OPT + $ε$ misclassification error for a broad class of noise models. This setting substantially generalizes the widely-studied problem of classification under RCN with known noise rate, and corresponds to a non-convex optimization problem even when the noise function -- i.e. the flipping probabilities of all points -- is known in advance.},

While gradient-based optimization methods are widely used to solve such problems, there are however many scenarios where these techniques are not well-suited, or even not applicable when the gradient is not accessible. We investigate the use of direct-search methods that belong to a class of derivative-free techniques that only access the objective function through an oracle. In this work, we design a novel algorithm in the context of min-max saddle point games where one sequentially updates the min and the max player. We prove convergence of this algorithm under mild assumptions, where the objective of the max-player satisfies the Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) condition, while the min-player is characterized by a nonconvex objective. Our method only assumes dynamically adjusted accurate estimates of the oracle with a fixed probability. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the first one to address the convergence of a direct-search method for min-max objectives in a stochastic setting.},

 abstract = { Many contemporary machine learning models require extensive tuning of hyperparameters to perform well. A variety of methods, such as Bayesian optimization, have been developed to automate and expedite this process. However, tuning remains extremely costly as it typically requires repeatedly fully training models. To address this issue, Bayesian optimization methods have been extended to use cheap, partially trained models to extrapolate to expensive complete models. While this approach enlarges the set of explored hyperparameters, including many low-fidelity observations adds to the intrinsic randomness of the procedure and makes extrapolation challenging. We propose to accelerate hyperparameter tuning for neural networks in a robust way by taking into account the relative amount of information contributed by each training example. To do so, we integrate importance sampling with Bayesian optimization, which significantly increases the quality of the black-box function evaluations and their runtime. To overcome the additional overhead cost of using importance sampling, we cast hyperparameter search as a multi-task Bayesian optimization problem over both hyperparameters and importance sampling design, which achieves the best of both worlds. Through learning a trade-off between training complexity and quality, our method improves upon validation error, in the average and worst-case. We show that this results in more reliable performance of our method in less wall-clock time across a variety of and datasets complex neural architectures. },

Simulation provides a useful platform to evaluate the extremal risks of these systems before their deployments. Importance Sampling (IS), while proven to be powerful for rare-event simulation, faces challenges in handling these learning-based systems due to their black-box nature that fundamentally undermines its efficiency guarantee, which can lead to under-estimation without diagnostically detected. We propose a framework called Deep Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation (Deep-PrAE) to design statistically guaranteed IS, by converting black-box samplers that are versatile but could lack guarantees, into one with what we call a relaxed efficiency certificate that allows accurate estimation of bounds on the safety-critical event probability. We present the theory of Deep-PrAE that combines the dominating point concept with rare-event set learning via deep neural network classifiers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in numerical examples including the safety-testing of an intelligent driving algorithm.},

For example, one popular hypothesis is that the algorithms learn good representations for transfer, as in multi-task learning. In this work, we contribute by providing a series of empirical and theoretical studies, and discover several interesting yet previously unknown properties of the algorithm. We find MAML adapts better with a deep architecture even if the tasks need only a shallow one (and thus, no representation learning is needed). While echoing previous findings by others that the bottom layers in deep architectures enable representation learning, we also find that upper layers enable fast adaptation by being meta-learned to perform adaptive gradient update when generalizing to new tasks. Motivated by these findings, we study several meta-optimization approaches and propose a new one for learning to optimize adaptively. Those approaches attain stronger performance in meta-learning both shallower and deeper architectures than MAML.},

 abstract = {A common assumption in generative models is that the generator immerses the latent space into a Euclidean ambient space. Instead, we consider the ambient space to be a Riemannian manifold, which allows for encoding domain knowledge through the associated Riemannian metric. Shortest paths can then be defined accordingly in the latent space to both follow the learned manifold and respect the ambient geometry. Through careful design of the ambient metric we can ensure that shortest paths are well-behaved even for deterministic generators that otherwise would exhibit a misleading bias. Experimentally we show that our approach improves interpretability of learned representations both using stochastic and deterministic generators.},

 abstract = {We study regret minimization in a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting and establish a fundamental trade-off between the regret suffered under an algorithm, and its statistical robustness. Considering broad classes of underlying arms' distributions, we show that bandit learning algorithms with logarithmic regret are always inconsistent and that consistent learning algorithms always suffer a super-logarithmic regret. This result highlights the inevitable statistical fragility of all `logarithmic regret' bandit algorithms available in the literature---for instance, if a UCB algorithm designed for $\sigma$-subGaussian distributions is used in a subGaussian setting with a mismatched variance parameter, the learning performance could be inconsistent. Next, we show a positive result: statistically robust and consistent learning performance is attainable if we allow the regret to be slightly worse than logarithmic. Specifically, we propose three classes of distribution oblivious algorithms that achieve an asymptotic regret that is arbitrarily close to logarithmic.},

Recent literature has explored representation learning to achieve this goal. In this work, we discuss the pitfalls of these strategies - such as a steep trade-off between achieving balance and predictive power - and present a remedy via the integration of balancing weights in causal learning. Specifically, we theoretically link balance to the quality of propensity estimation, emphasize the importance of identifying a proper target population, and elaborate on the complementary roles of feature balancing and weight adjustments. Using these concepts, we then develop an algorithm for flexible, scalable and accurate estimation of causal effects. Finally, we show how the learned weighted representations may serve to facilitate alternative causal learning procedures with appealing statistical features. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic examples and standard benchmarks, and report encouraging results relative to state-of-the-art baselines.},

We consider here the classic regression setup, where a real valued square integrable r.v. $Y$ is to be predicted upon observing a (possibly high dimensional) random vector $X$ by means of a predictive function $f(X)$ as accurately as possible in the mean-squared sense and study a nearest-neighbour-based pointwise estimate of the gradient of the optimal predictive function, the regression function $m(x)=\mathbb{E}[Y\mid X=x]$. Under classic smoothness conditions combined with the assumption that the tails of $Y-m(X)$ are sub-Gaussian, we prove nonasymptotic bounds improving upon those obtained for alternative estimation methods. Beyond the novel theoretical results established, several illustrative numerical experiments have been carried out. The latter provide strong empirical evidence that the estimation method proposed works very well for various statistical problems involving gradient estimation, namely dimensionality reduction, stochastic gradient descent optimization and quantifying disentanglement.},

In this paper, we consider the distributed M-estimation problem in both regular and sparse case and propose a novel one-round communication efficient algorithm. For regular distributed M-estimator, the asymptotic normality is provided to conduct statistical inference. For sparse distributed M-estimator, we only require solving a quadratic Lasso problem in the master machine using the same local information as the regular distributed M-estimator. Consequently, the computation complexity of the local machine is sufficiently reduced compared with the existing debiased sparse estimator. Under mild conditions, the theoretical results guarantee that our proposed distributed estimators achieve (near)optimal statistical convergence rate. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is verified through experiments across different M-estimation problems using both synthetic and real benchmark datasets. },

 abstract = { We study class-posterior probability estimation (CPE) for binary responses where one class has much fewer data than the other. For example, events such as species co-occurrence in ecology and wars in political science are often much rarer than non-events. Logistic regression has been widely used for CPE, while it tends to underestimate the probability of rare events. Its main drawback is symmetry of the logit linkâsymmetric links can be misled by small and imbalanced samples because it is more incentivized to overestimate the majority class with finite samples. Parametric skewed links have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but their estimation usually results in nonconvex optimization unlike the logit link. Such nonconvexity is knotty not only from the computational viewpoint but also in terms of the parameter identifiability. In this paper, we provide a procedure to derive a convex loss for a skewed link based on the recently proposed Fenchel-Young losses. The derived losses are always convex and have a nice property suitable for class imbalance. The simulation shows the practicality of the derived losses. },

 abstract = {We study a novel variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, where at each time step, the player observes an independently sampled context that determines the arms' mean rewards. However, playing an arm blocks it (across all contexts) for a fixed and known number of future time steps. The above contextual setting, which captures important scenarios such as recommendation systems or ad placement with diverse users, invalidates greedy solution techniques that are effective for its non-contextual counterpart (Basu et al., NeurIPS19). Assuming knowledge of the context distribution and the mean reward of each arm-context pair, we cast the problem as an online bipartite matching problem, where the right-vertices (contexts) arrive stochastically and the left-vertices (arms) are blocked for a finite number of rounds each time they are matched. This problem has been recently studied in the full-information case, where competitive ratio bounds have been derived. We focus on the bandit setting, where the reward distributions are initially unknown; we propose a UCB-based variant of the full-information algorithm that guarantees a $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$-regret w.r.t. an $α$-optimal strategy in $T$ time steps, matching the $Ω(\log(T))$ regret lower bound in this setting. Due to the time correlations caused by blocking, existing techniques for upper bounding regret fail. For proving our regret bounds, we introduce the novel concepts of delayed exploitation and opportunistic subsampling and combine them with ideas from combinatorial bandits and non-stationary Markov chains coupling.},

We further derive bi-Lipschitz properties of atomic building blocks of common architectures. These insights into the stability of INNs then provide ways forward to remedy these failures. For tasks where local invertibility is sufficient, like memory-saving backprop, we propose a flexible and efficient regularizer. For problems where global invertibility is necessary, such as applying normalizing flows on OOD data, we show the importance of designing stable INN building blocks.},

Despite their powerful predictivity, this lack of interpretability may be highly restrictive for applications with critical decisions at stake. On the other hand, algorithms with a simple structure-typically decision trees, rule algorithms, or sparse linear models-are well known for their instability. This undesirable feature makes the conclusions of the data analysis unreliable and turns out to be a strong operational limitation. This motivates the design of SIRUS, which combines a simple structure with a remarkable stable behavior when data is perturbed. The algorithm is based on random forests, the predictive accuracy of which is preserved. We demonstrate the efficiency of the method both empirically (through experiments) and theoretically (with the proof of its asymptotic stability).

We study an OPE problem in an infinite-horizon, ergodic Markov decision process with unobserved confounders, where states and actions can act as proxies for the unobserved confounders. We show how, given only a latent variable model for states and actions, policy value can be identified from off-policy data. Our method involves two stages. In the first, we show how to use proxies to estimate stationary distribution ratios, extending recent work on breaking the curse of horizon to the confounded setting. In the second, we show optimal balancing can be combined with such learned ratios to obtain policy value while avoiding direct modeling of reward functions.

 abstract = { Principal Component Regression (PCR) is a popular method for prediction from data, and is one way to address the so-called multi-collinearity problem in regression. It was shown recently that algorithms for PCR such as hard singular value thresholding (HSVT) are also quite robust, in that they can handle data that has missing or noisy covariates. However, such spectral approaches require strong distributional assumptions on which entries are observed. Specifically, every covariate is assumed to be observed with probability (exactly) $p$, for some value of $p$. Our goal in this work is to weaken this requirement, and as a step towards this, we study a âsemi-randomâ model. In this model, every covariate is revealed with probability $p$, and then an adversary comes in and reveals additional covariates. While the model seems intuitively easier, it is well known that algorithms such as HSVT perform poorly. Our approach is based on studying the closely related problem of Noisy Matrix Completion in a semi-random setting. By considering a new semidefinite programming relaxation, we develop new guarantees for matrix completion, which is our core technical contribution. },

Classically, simple algorithms that obtain the optimal $\sqrt{T}$ regret already are very stable and do not incur a significant movement cost. However, recent work has shown that when the learning algorithm is provided with weak âhintâ vectors that have a positive correlation with the costs, the regret can be significantly improved to $\log(T)$. In this work, we study the stability of such algorithms, and provide matching upper and lower bounds showing that incorporating movement costs results in intricate tradeoffs between $\log(T)$ when $\epsilon\ge 1$ and $\sqrt{T}$ regret when $\epsilon=0$. },

 abstract = {The data drawn from biological, economic, and social systems are often confounded due to the presence of unmeasured variables. Prior work in causal discovery has focused on discrete search procedures for selecting acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), specifically ancestral ADMGs, that encode ordinary conditional independence constraints among the observed variables of the system. However, confounded systems also exhibit more general equality restrictions that cannot be represented via these graphs, placing a limit on the kinds of structures that can be learned using ancestral ADMGs. In this work, we derive differentiable algebraic constraints that fully characterize the space of ancestral ADMGs, as well as more general classes of ADMGs, arid ADMGs and bow-free ADMGs, that capture all equality restrictions on the observed variables. We use these constraints to cast causal discovery as a continuous optimization problem and design differentiable procedures to find the best fitting ADMG when the data comes from a confounded linear system of equations with correlated errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through simulations and application to a protein expression dataset. Code implementing our methods is open-source and publicly available at https://gitlab.com/rbhatta8/dcd and will be incorporated into the Ananke package.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we study high-dimensional estimation from truncated samples. We focus on two fundamental and classical problems: (i) inference of sparse Gaussian graphical models and (ii) support recovery of sparse linear models. (i) For Gaussian graphical models, suppose $d$-dimensional samples ${\bf x}$ are generated from a Gaussian $N(μ,Σ)$ and observed only if they belong to a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. We show that $μ$ and $Σ$ can be estimated with error $ε$ in the Frobenius norm, using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\textrm{nz}(Σ^{-1})}{ε^2}\right)$ samples from a truncated $\mathcal{N}(μ,Σ)$ and having access to a membership oracle for $S$. The set $S$ is assumed to have non-trivial measure under the unknown distribution but is otherwise arbitrary. (ii) For sparse linear regression, suppose samples $({\bf x},y)$ are generated where $y = {\bf x}^\top{Ω^*} + \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $({\bf x}, y)$ is seen only if $y$ belongs to a truncation set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}$. We consider the case that $Ω^*$ is sparse with a support set of size $k$. Our main result is to establish precise conditions on the problem dimension $d$, the support size $k$, the number of observations $n$, and properties of the samples and the truncation that are sufficient to recover the support of $Ω^*$. Specifically, we show that under some mild assumptions, only $O(k^2 \log d)$ samples are needed to estimate $Ω^*$ in the $\ell_\infty$-norm up to a bounded error. For both problems, our estimator minimizes the sum of the finite population negative log-likelihood function and an $\ell_1$-regularization term.},

 abstract = {Computing the discrepancy between time series of variable sizes is notoriously challenging. While dynamic time warping (DTW) is popularly used for this purpose, it is not differentiable everywhere and is known to lead to bad local optima when used as a "loss". Soft-DTW addresses these issues, but it is not a positive definite divergence: due to the bias introduced by entropic regularization, it can be negative and it is not minimized when the time series are equal. We propose in this paper a new divergence, dubbed soft-DTW divergence, which aims to correct these issues. We study its properties; in particular, under conditions on the ground cost, we show that it is a valid divergence: it is non-negative and minimized if and only if the two time series are equal. We also propose a new "sharp" variant by further removing entropic bias. We showcase our divergences on time series averaging and demonstrate significant accuracy improvements compared to both DTW and soft-DTW on 84 time series classification datasets.},

 abstract = {Simulated annealing is an effective and general means of optimization. It is in fact inspired by metallurgy, where the temperature of a material determines its behavior in thermodynamics. Likewise, in simulated annealing, the actions that the algorithm takes depend entirely on the value of a variable which captures the notion of temperature. Typically, simulated annealing starts with a high temperature, which makes the algorithm pretty unpredictable, and gradually cools the temperature down to become more stable. A key component that plays a crucial role in the performance of simulated annealing is the criteria under which the temperature changes namely, the cooling schedule. Motivated by this, we study the following question in this work: "Given enough samples to the instances of a specific class of optimization problems, can we design optimal (or approximately optimal) cooling schedules that minimize the runtime or maximize the success rate of the algorithm on average when the underlying problem is drawn uniformly at random from the same class?" We provide positive results both in terms of sample complexity and simulation complexity. For sample complexity, we show that $\tilde O(\sqrt{m})$ samples suffice to find an approximately optimal cooling schedule of length $m$. We complement this result by giving a lower bound of $\tilde \Omega(m^{1/3})$ on the sample complexity of any learning algorithm that provides an almost optimal cooling schedule. These results are general and rely on no assumption. For simulation complexity, however, we make additional assumptions to measure the success rate of an algorithm. To this end, we introduce the monotone stationary graph that models the performance of simulated annealing. Based on this model, we present polynomial time algorithms with provable guarantees for the learning problem.},

Although many different Gaussian process models are readily available when the input space is Euclidean, the choice is much more limited for Gaussian processes whose input space is an undirected graph. In this work, we leverage the stochastic partial differential equation characterization of MatÃ©rn Gaussian processesâa widely-used model class in the Euclidean settingâto study their analog for undirected graphs. We show that the resulting Gaussian processes inherit various attractive properties of their Euclidean and Riemannian analogs and provide techniques that allow them to be trained using standard methods, such as inducing points.

The contraction rate of this error estimate as a function of the solver's step size identifies it as a well-calibrated worst-case error, but its explicit numerical value for a certain step size is not automatically a good estimate of the explicit error. Addressing this issue, we introduce, discuss, and assess several probabilistically motivated ways to calibrate the uncertainty estimate. Numerical experiments demonstrate that these calibration methods interact efficiently with adaptive step-size selection, resulting in descriptive, and efficiently computable posteriors.

 abstract = {To address functional-output regression, we introduce projection learning (PL), a novel dictionary-based approach that learns to predict a function that is expanded on a dictionary while minimizing an empirical risk based on a functional loss. PL makes it possible to use non orthogonal dictionaries and can then be combined with dictionary learning; it is thus much more flexible than expansion-based approaches relying on vectorial losses. This general method is instantiated with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector-valued functions as kernel-based projection learning (KPL). For the functional square loss, two closed-form estimators are proposed, one for fully observed output functions and the other for partially observed ones. Both are backed theoretically by an excess risk analysis. Then, in the more general setting of integral losses based on differentiable ground losses, KPL is implemented using first-order optimization for both fully and partially observed output functions. Eventually, several robustness aspects of the proposed algorithms are highlighted on a toy dataset; and a study on two real datasets shows that they are competitive compared to other nonlinear approaches. Notably, using the square loss and a learnt dictionary, KPL enjoys a particularily attractive trade-off between computational cost and performances.},

The rate is an upper bound on the mutual information, which is often interpreted as a regularizer that controls the degree of compression. We here examine whether inclusion of the rate term also improves generalization. We perform rate-distortion analyses in which we control the strength of the rate term, the network capacity, and the difficulty of the generalization problem. Lowering the strength of the rate term paradoxically improves generalization in most settings, and reducing the mutual information typically leads to underfitting. Moreover, we show that generalization performance continues to improve even after the mutual information saturates, indicating that the gap on the bound (i.e. the KL divergence relative to the inference marginal) affects generalization. This suggests that the standard spherical Gaussian prior is not an inductive bias that typically improves generalization, prompting further work to understand what choices of priors improve generalization in VAEs. },

When these relationships have different modalities, they are better modelled by multilayer graphs where each layer is associated with one modality. Such graphs arise naturally in many contexts including biological and social networks. Clustering is a fundamental problem in network analysis where the goal is to regroup nodes with similar connectivity profiles. In the past decade, various clustering methods have been extended from the unilayer setting to multilayer graphs in order to incorporate the information provided by each layer. While most existing works assume - rather restrictively - that all layers share the same set of nodes, we propose a new framework that allows for layers to be defined on different sets of nodes. In particular, the nodes not recorded in a layer are treated as missing. Within this paradigm, we investigate several generalizations of well-known clustering methods in the complete setting to the incomplete one and prove some consistency results under the Multi-Layer Stochastic Block Model assumption. Our theoretical results are complemented by thorough numerical comparisons between our proposed algorithms on synthetic data, and also on real datasets, thus highlighting the promising behaviour of our methods in various settings.},

We consider settings with stochastic rewards, patience constraints, and weights (both vertex- and edge-weighted variants). We introduce a stochastic variant of the patience-constrained problem, where the patience is chosen randomly according to some known distribution and is not known until the point at which patience has been exhausted. We also consider stochastic arrival settings (i.e., online vertex arrival is determined by a known random process), which are natural settings that are able to beat the hard worst-case bounds of more pessimistic adversarial arrivals. 
Our approach to online matching utilizes black-box algorithms for matching on star graphs under various models of patience. In support of this, we design algorithms which solve the star graph problem optimally for patience with a constant hazard rate and yield a 1/2-approximation for any patience distribution. This 1/2-approximation also improves existing guarantees for cascade-click models in the product ranking literature, in which a user must be shown a sequence of items with various click-through-rates and the user's patience could run out at any time. 
We then build a framework which uses these star graph algorithms as black boxes to solve the online matching problems under different arrival settings. We show improved (or first-known) competitive ratios for these problems. Finally, we present negative results that include formalizing the concept of a stochasticity gap for LP upper bounds on these problems, bounding the worst-case performance of some popular greedy approaches, and showing the impossibility of having an adversarial patience in the product ranking setting.},

But the algorithm is not guaranteed to converge to the desired distribution in the case of multivariate binary distributions (e.g., Ising models or stochastic neural networks such as Boltzmann machines) if the variables (sites or neurons) are updated in a fixed order, a setting commonly used in practice. The reason is that the corresponding Markov chain may not be irreducible. We propose a modified Metropolis transition operator that behaves almost always identically to the standard Metropolis operator and prove that it ensures irreducibility and convergence to the limiting distribution in the multivariate binary case with fixed-order updates. The result provides an explanation for the behaviour of Metropolis MCMC in that setting and closes a long-standing theoretical gap. We experimentally studied the standard and modified Metropolis operator for models were they actually behave differently. If the standard algorithm also converges, the modified operator exhibits similar (if not better) performance in terms of convergence speed.},

While many works have been focusing on understanding the loss dynamics by training neural networks with the gradient descent (GD), in this work, we consider a broad class of optimization algorithms that are commonly used in practice. For example, we show from a dynamical system perspective that the Heavy Ball (HB) method can converge to global minimum on mean squared error (MSE) at a linear rate (similar to GD); however, the Nesterov accelerated gradient descent (NAG) may only converges to global minimum sublinearly. 
Our results rely on the connection between neural tangent kernel (NTK) and finite over-parameterized neural networks with ReLU activation, which leads to analyzing the limiting ordinary differential equations (ODE) for optimization algorithms. We show that, optimizing the non-convex loss over the weights corresponds to optimizing some strongly convex loss over the prediction error. As a consequence, we can leverage the classical convex optimization theory to understand the convergence behavior of neural networks.

After factorizing the joint distribution into conditional distributions of each variable, given its parents (the "causal mechanisms"), we attribute the change to changes of these causal mechanisms. This attribution analysis accounts for the fact that mechanisms often change independently and sometimes only some of them change. Through simulations, we study the performance of our distribution change attribution method. We then present a real-world case study identifying the drivers of the difference in the income distribution between men and women.},

 abstract = {Given a set $\mathcal{C}=\{C_i\}_{i=1}^m$ of square matrices, the matrix blind joint block diagonalization problem (BJBDP) is to find a full column rank matrix $A$ such that $C_i=A\Sigma_iA^\text{T}$ for all $i$, where $\Sigma_i$'s are all block diagonal matrices with as many diagonal blocks as possible. The BJBDP plays an important role in independent subspace analysis (ISA). This paper considers the identification problem for BJBDP, that is, under what conditions and by what means, we can identify the diagonalizer $A$ and the block diagonal structure of $\Sigma_i$, especially when there is noise in $C_i$'s. In this paper, we propose a ``bi-block diagonalization'' method to solve BJBDP, and establish sufficient conditions under which the method is able to accomplish the task. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results. To the best of the authors' knowledge, existing numerical methods for BJBDP have no theoretical guarantees for the identification of the exact solution, whereas our method does.},

While previous work has developed algorithmic approaches to attacking and defending VAEs, there remains a lack of formalization for what it means for a VAE to be robust. To address this, we develop a novel criterion for robustness in probabilistic models: $r$-robustness. We then use this to construct the first theoretical results for the robustness of VAEs, deriving margins in the input space for which we can provide guarantees about the resulting reconstruction. Informally, we are able to define a region within which any perturbation will produce a reconstruction that is similar to the original reconstruction. To support our analysis, we show that VAEs trained using disentangling methods not only score well under our robustness metrics, but that the reasons for this can be interpreted through our theoretical results.},

As we show, existing probabilistic deep generative models (DGMs), which are tailor-made for image data, underperform on non-linear ICA tasks. To address this, we propose a DGM which combines bijective feature maps with a linear ICA model to learn interpretable latent structures for high-dimensional data. Given the complexities of jointly training such a hybrid model, we introduce novel theory that constrains linear ICA to lie close to the manifold of orthogonal rectangular matrices, the Stiefel manifold. By doing so we create models that converge quickly, are easy to train, and achieve better unsupervised latent factor discovery than flow-based models, linear ICA, and Variational Autoencoders on images. },

While this high-level overlap has been previously noted, there remain open questions on how to best formulate active learning as a communications system to leverage existing analysis and algorithms in feedback coding. In this work, we formally identify and leverage the structural commonalities between the two problems, including the characterization of encoder and noisy channel components, to design a new algorithm. Specifically, we develop an optimal transport-based feedback coding scheme called Approximate Posterior Matching (APM) for the task of active example selection and explore its application to Bayesian logistic regression, a popular model in active learning. We evaluate APM on a variety of datasets and demonstrate learning performance comparable to existing active learning methods, at a reduced computational cost. These results demonstrate the potential of directly deploying concepts from feedback channel coding to design efficient active learning strategies.},

The $m\times k$ matrix $A$ and the $k\times n$ matrix $W$ are both constrained to have non-negative entries. This is in contrast to singular value decomposition, where the matrices $A$ and $W$ can have negative entries but must satisfy the orthogonality constraint: the columns of $A$ are orthogonal and the rows of $W$ are also orthogonal. The orthogonal non-negative matrix factorization (ONMF) problem imposes both the non-negativity and the orthogonality constraints, and previous work showed that it leads to better performances than NMF on many clustering tasks. We give the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for ONMF when one or both of $A$ and $W$ are subject to the orthogonality constraint. We also show an interesting connection to the correlation clustering problem on bipartite graphs. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our algorithm achieves similar or smaller errors compared to previous ONMF algorithms while ensuring perfect orthogonality (many previous algorithms do not satisfy the hard orthogonality constraint).},

We derive novel convergence rates showcasing these trade-offs and highlight their importance in communication-limited settings. Using these insights, we are able to compare local update methods based on their convergence/accuracy trade-off, not just their convergence to critical points of the empirical loss.

Well-studied problems such as rank aggregation, correlation clustering, and hierarchical clustering with triplet constraints fall in this class of problems. We study these problems on stochastic instances with a hidden embedded ground truth solution. Our main algorithmic contribution is a unified technique that uses the maximum cut problem in graphs to approximately solve these problems. Using this technique, we can often get approximation guarantees in the stochastic setting that are better than the known worst case inapproximability bounds for the corresponding problem. On the negative side, we improve the worst case inapproximability bound on several hierarchical clustering formulations through a reduction to related ranking problems.},

In this paper, we propose a unified framework of constructing sketching methods in kernel ridge regression (KRR), which views the sketching matrix S as an accumulation of m rescaled sub-sampling matrices with independent columns. Our framework incorporates two commonly used sketching methods, sub-sampling sketches (known as the NystrÃ¶m method) and sub-Gaussian sketches, as special cases with m=1 and m=infinity respectively. Under the new framework, we provide a unified error analysis of sketching approximation and show that our accumulation scheme improves the low accuracy of sub-sampling sketches when certain incoherence characteristic is high, and accelerates the more accurate but computationally heavier sub-Gaussian sketches. By optimally choosing the number m of accumulations, we show that a best trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy can be achieved. In practice, the sketching method can be as efficiently implemented as the sub-sampling sketches, as only minor extra matrix additions are needed. Our empirical evaluations also demonstrate that the proposed method may attain the accuracy close to sub-Gaussian sketches, while is as efficient as sub-sampling-based sketches. },

Latent variable models can be used to infer labels from weaker, easier-to-acquire sources operating on unlabeled data. Such models can also be trained using labeled data, presenting a key question: should a user invest in few labeled or many unlabeled points? We answer this via a framework centered on model misspecification in method-of-moments latent variable estimation. Our core result is a bias-variance decomposition of the generalization error, which shows that the unlabeled-only approach incurs additional bias under misspecification. We then introduce a correction that provably removes this bias in certain cases. We apply our decomposition framework to three scenarios -- well-specified, misspecified, and corrected models -- to 1) choose between labeled and unlabeled data and 2) learn from their combination. We observe theoretically and with synthetic experiments that for well-specified models, labeled points are worth a constant factor more than unlabeled points. With misspecification, however, their relative value is higher due to the additional bias but can be reduced with correction. We also apply our approach to study real-world weak supervision techniques for dataset construction.},

 abstract = {Machine learning is used to make decisions for individuals in various fields, which require us to achieve good prediction accuracy while ensuring fairness with respect to sensitive features (e.g., race and gender). This problem, however, remains difficult in complex real-world scenarios. To quantify unfairness under such situations, existing methods utilize {\it path-specific causal effects}. However, none of them can ensure fairness for each individual without making impractical functional assumptions on the data. In this paper, we propose a far more practical framework for learning an individually fair classifier. To avoid restrictive functional assumptions, we define the {\it probability of individual unfairness} (PIU) and solve an optimization problem where PIU's upper bound, which can be estimated from data, is controlled to be close to zero. We elucidate why our method can guarantee fairness for each individual. Experimental results show that our method can learn an individually fair classifier at a slight cost of accuracy.},

 abstract = {We establish a bridge between spectral clustering and Gromov-Wasserstein Learning (GWL), a recent optimal transport-based approach to graph partitioning. This connection both explains and improves upon the state-of-the-art performance of GWL. The Gromov-Wasserstein framework provides probabilistic correspondences between nodes of source and target graphs via a quadratic programming relaxation of the node matching problem. Our results utilize and connect the observations that the GW geometric structure remains valid for any rank-2 tensor, in particular the adjacency, distance, and various kernel matrices on graphs, and that the heat kernel outperforms the adjacency matrix in producing stable and informative node correspondences. Using the heat kernel in the GWL framework provides new multiscale graph comparisons without compromising theoretical guarantees, while immediately yielding improved empirical results. A key insight of the GWL framework toward graph partitioning was to compute GW correspondences from a source graph to a template graph with isolated, self-connected nodes. We show that when comparing against a two-node template graph using the heat kernel at the infinite time limit, the resulting partition agrees with the partition produced by the Fiedler vector. This in turn yields a new insight into the k-cut graph partitioning problem through the lens of optimal transport. Our experiments on a range of real-world networks achieve comparable results to, and in many cases outperform, the state-of-the-art achieved by GWL.},

 abstract = { Extending model-based regret minimization strategies for Markov decision processes (MDPs) beyond discrete state-action spaces requires structural assumptions on the reward and transition models. Existing parametric approaches establish regret guarantees by making strong assumptions about either the state transition distribution or the value function as a function of state-action features, and often do not satisfactorily capture classical problems like linear dynamical systems or factored MDPs. This paper introduces a new MDP transition model defined by a collection of linearly parameterized exponential families with $d$ unknown parameters. For finite-horizon episodic RL with horizon $H$ in this MDP model, we propose a model-based upper confidence RL algorithm (Exp-UCRL) that solves a penalized maximum likelihood estimation problem to learn the $d$-dimensional representation of the transition distribution, balancing the exploitation-exploration tradeoff using confidence sets in the exponential family space. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm by proving a frequentist (worst-case) regret bound that is of order $\tilde O(d\sqrt{H^3 N})$, sub-linear in total time $N$, linear in dimension $d$, and polynomial in the planning horizon $H$. This is achieved by deriving a novel concentration inequality for conditional exponential families that might be of independent interest. The exponential family MDP model also admits an efficient posterior sampling-style algorithm for which a similar guarantee on the Bayesian regret is shown. },

Most existing BO algorithms do not model the fact that the multiple objectives, or equivalently, tasks can share similarities, and even the few that do lack rigorous, finite-time regret guarantees that capture explicitly inter-task structure. In this work, we address this problem by modelling inter-task dependencies using a multi-task kernel and develop two novel BO algorithms based on random scalarizations of the objectives. Our algorithms employ vector-valued kernel regression as a stepping stone and belong to the upper confidence bound class of algorithms. Under a smoothness assumption that the unknown vector-valued function is an element of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the multi-task kernel, we derive worst-case regret bounds for our algorithms that explicitly capture the similarities between tasks. We numerically benchmark our algorithms on both synthetic and real-life MOO problems, and show the advantages offered by learning with multi-task kernels.},

 abstract = {Computing the marginal likelihood or evidence is one of the core challenges in Bayesian analysis. While there are many established methods for estimating this quantity, they predominantly rely on using a large number of posterior samples obtained from a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. As the dimension of the parameter space increases, however, many of these methods become prohibitively slow and potentially inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a novel method in which we use the MCMC samples to learn a high probability partition of the parameter space and then form a deterministic approximation over each of these partition sets. This two-step procedure, which constitutes both a probabilistic and a deterministic component, is termed a Hybrid approximation to the marginal likelihood. We demonstrate its versatility in a plethora of examples with varying dimension and sample size, and we also highlight the Hybrid approximation's effectiveness in situations where there is either a limited number or only approximate MCMC samples available.},

 abstract = {We study the problem of online clustering where a clustering algorithm has to assign a new point that arrives to one of $k$ clusters. The specific formulation we use is the $k$-means objective: At each time step the algorithm has to maintain a set of k candidate centers and the loss incurred is the squared distance between the new point and the closest center. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to the best solution to the $k$-means objective ($\mathcal{C}$) in hindsight. We show that provided the data lies in a bounded region, an implementation of the Multiplicative Weights Update Algorithm (MWUA) using a discretized grid achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ in expectation. We also present an online-to-offline reduction that shows that an efficient no-regret online algorithm (despite being allowed to choose a different set of candidate centres at each round) implies an offline efficient algorithm for the $k$-means problem. In light of this hardness, we consider the slightly weaker requirement of comparing regret with respect to $(1 + ε) \mathcal{C}$ and present a no-regret algorithm with runtime $O\left(T(\mathrm{poly}(log(T),k,d,1/ε)^{k(d+O(1))}\right)$. Our algorithm is based on maintaining an incremental coreset and an adaptive variant of the MWUA. We show that naïve online algorithms, such as \emph{Follow The Leader}, fail to produce sublinear regret in the worst case. We also report preliminary experiments with synthetic and real-world data.},

 abstract = {Common datasets have the form of elements with keys (e.g., transactions and products) and the goal is to perform analytics on the aggregated form of key and frequency pairs. A weighted sample of keys by (a function of) frequency is a highly versatile summary that provides a sparse set of representative keys and supports approximate evaluations of query statistics. We propose private weighted sampling (PWS): A method that ensures element-level differential privacy while retaining, to the extent possible, the utility of a respective non-private weighted sample. PWS maximizes the reporting probabilities of keys and estimation quality of a broad family of statistics. PWS improves over the state of the art also for the well-studied special case of private histograms, when no sampling is performed. We empirically demonstrate significant performance gains compared with prior baselines: 20%-300% increase in key reporting for common Zipfian frequency distributions and accuracy for $\times 2$-$ 8$ lower frequencies in estimation tasks. Moreover, PWS is applied as a simple post-processing of a non-private sample, without requiring the original data. This allows for seamless integration with existing implementations of non-private schemes and retaining the efficiency of schemes designed for resource-constrained settings such as massive distributed or streamed data. We believe that due to practicality and performance, PWS may become a method of choice in applications where privacy is desired.},

 abstract = {The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data can be modeled as lying on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) approximate this manifold by learning mappings from low-dimensional latent vectors to high-dimensional data while encouraging a global structure in the latent space through the use of a specified prior distribution. When this prior does not match the structure of the true data manifold, it can lead to a less accurate model of the data. To resolve this mismatch, we introduce the Variational Autoencoder with Learned Latent Structure (VAELLS) which incorporates a learnable manifold model into the latent space of a VAE. This enables us to learn the nonlinear manifold structure from the data and use that structure to define a prior in the latent space. The integration of a latent manifold model not only ensures that our prior is well-matched to the data, but also allows us to define generative transformation paths in the latent space and describe class manifolds with transformations stemming from examples of each class. We validate our model on examples with known latent structure and also demonstrate its capabilities on a real-world dataset.},

 abstract = { Combinatorial bandit models and algorithms are used in many sequential decision-making tasks ranging from item list recommendation to influence maximization. Typical algorithms proposed for combinatorial bandits, including combinatorial UCB (CUCB) and combinatorial Thompson sampling (CTS) do not exploit correlations between base arms during the learning process. Moreover, their regret is usually analyzed under independent base arm outcomes. In this paper, we use Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model correlations between base arms. In particular, we consider a combinatorial bandit model with probabilistically triggered arms, and assume that the expected base arm outcome function is a sample from a GP. We assume that the learner has access to an exact computation oracle, which returns an optimal solution given expected base arm outcomes, and analyze the regret of Combinatorial Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (ComGP-UCB) algorithm for this setting. Under (triggering probability modulated) Lipschitz continuity assumption on the expected reward function, we derive ($O( \sqrt{m T \log T \gamma_{T, \boldsymbol{\mu}}^{PTA}})$) $O(m \sqrt{\frac{T \log T}{p^*}})$ upper bounds for the regret of ComGP-UCB that hold with high probability, where $m$ denotes the number of base arms, $p^*$ denotes the minimum non-zero triggering probability, and $\gamma_{T, \boldsymbol{\mu}}^{PTA}$ denotes the pseudo-information gain. Finally, we show via simulations that when the correlations between base arm outcomes are strong, ComGP-UCB significantly outperforms CUCB and CTS. },

 abstract = {Local SGD is a promising approach to overcome the communication overhead in distributed learning by reducing the synchronization frequency among worker nodes. Despite the recent theoretical advances of local SGD in empirical risk minimization, the efficiency of its counterpart in minimax optimization remains unexplored. Motivated by large scale minimax learning problems, such as adversarial robust learning and training generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose local Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (local SGDA), where the primal and dual variables can be trained locally and averaged periodically to significantly reduce the number of communications. We show that local SGDA can provably optimize distributed minimax problems in both homogeneous and heterogeneous data with reduced number of communications and establish convergence rates under strongly-convex-strongly-concave and nonconvex-strongly-concave settings. In addition, we propose a novel variant local SGDA+, to solve nonconvex-nonconcave problems. We give corroborating empirical evidence on different distributed minimax problems.},

 abstract = {Data augmentation by incorporating cheap unlabeled data from multiple domains is a powerful way to improve prediction especially when there is limited labeled data. In this work, we investigate how adversarial robustness can be enhanced by leveraging out-of-domain unlabeled data. We demonstrate that for broad classes of distributions and classifiers, there exists a sample complexity gap between standard and robust classification. We quantify to what degree this gap can be bridged via leveraging unlabeled samples from a shifted domain by providing both upper and lower bounds. Moreover, we show settings where we achieve better adversarial robustness when the unlabeled data come from a shifted domain rather than the same domain as the labeled data. We also investigate how to leverage out-of-domain data when some structural information, such as sparsity, is shared between labeled and unlabeled domains. Experimentally, we augment two object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10 and SVHN) with easy to obtain and unlabeled out-of-domain data and demonstrate substantial improvement in the model's robustness against $\ell_\infty$ adversarial attacks on the original domain.},

Unfortunately, recent results have established that even approximate first-order stationary points of such objectives are intractable, even under smoothness conditions, motivating the study of min-max objectives with additional structure. We introduce a new class of structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max optimization problems, proposing a generalization of the extragradient algorithm which provably converges to a stationary point. The algorithm applies not only to Euclidean spaces, but also to general $\ell_p$-normed finite-dimensional real vector spaces. We also discuss its stability under stochastic oracles and provide bounds on its sample complexity. Our iteration complexity and sample complexity bounds either match or improve the best known bounds for the same or less general nonconvex-nonconcave settings, such as those that satisfy variational coherence or in which a weak solution to the associated variational inequality problem is assumed to exist.},

Although many algorithms have been proposed for contextual bandit, most of them rely on finding the maximum likelihood estimator at each iteration, which requires $O(t)$ time at the $t$-th iteration and are memory inefficient. A natural way to resolve this problem is to apply online stochastic gradient descent (SGD) so that the per-step time and memory complexity can be reduced to constant with respect to $t$, but a contextual bandit policy based on online SGD updates that balances exploration and exploitation has remained elusive. In this work, we show that online SGD can be applied to the generalized linear bandit problem. The proposed SGD-TS algorithm, which uses a single-step SGD update to exploit past information and uses Thompson Sampling for exploration, achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with the total time complexity that scales linearly in $T$ and $d$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds and $d$ is the number of features. Experimental results show that SGD-TS consistently outperforms existing algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets.},

We propose a sampling method called Random Coordinate ULMC (RC-ULMC), which selects a single coordinate at each iteration to be updated and leaves the other coordinates untouched. We investigate the computational complexity of RC-ULMC and compare it with the classical ULMC for strongly log-concave probability distributions. We show that RC-ULMC is always cheaper than the classical ULMC, with a significant cost reduction when the problem is highly skewed and high dimensional. Our complexity bound for RC-ULMC is also tight in terms of dimension dependence.},

 abstract = { State-of-the-art subspace clustering methods are based on convex formulations whose theoretical guarantees require the subspaces to be low-dimensional. Dual Principal Component Pursuit (DPCP) is a non-convex method that is specifically designed for learning high-dimensional subspaces, such as hyperplanes. However, existing analyses of DPCP in the multi-hyperplane case lack a precise characterization of the distribution of the data and involve quantities that are difficult to interpret. Moreover, the provable algorithm based on recursive linear programming is not efficient. In this paper, we introduce a new notion of geometric dominance, which explicitly captures the distribution of the data, and derive both geometric and probabilistic conditions under which a global solution to DPCP is a normal vector to a geometrically dominant hyperplane. We then prove that the DPCP problem for a union of hyperplanes satisfies a Riemannian regularity condition, and use this result to show that a scalable Riemannian subgradient method exhibits (local) linear convergence to the normal vector of the geometrically dominant hyperplane. Finally, we show that integrating DPCP into popular subspace clustering schemes, such as K-ensembles, leads to superior or competitive performance over the state-of-the-art in clustering hyperplanes. },

 abstract = {We study the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) problem using the Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation in which an agent aims to maximize the expected total reward subject to a safety constraint on the expected total value of a utility function. We focus on an episodic setting with the function approximation where the Markov transition kernels have a linear structure but do not impose any additional assumptions on the sampling model. Designing SRL algorithms with provable computational and statistical efficiency is particularly challenging under this setting because of the need to incorporate both the safety constraint and the function approximation into the fundamental exploitation/exploration tradeoff. To this end, we present an \underline{O}ptimistic \underline{P}rimal-\underline{D}ual Proximal Policy \underline{OP}timization (OPDOP) algorithm where the value function is estimated by combining the least-squares policy evaluation and an additional bonus term for safe exploration. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves an $\tilde{O}(d H^{2.5}\sqrt{T})$ regret and an $\tilde{O}(d H^{2.5}\sqrt{T})$ constraint violation, where $d$ is the dimension of the feature mapping, $H$ is the horizon of each episode, and $T$ is the total number of steps. These bounds hold when the reward/utility functions are fixed but the feedback after each episode is bandit. Our bounds depend on the capacity of the state-action space only through the dimension of the feature mapping and thus our results hold even when the number of states goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first provably efficient online policy optimization algorithm for CMDP with safe exploration in the function approximation setting.},

 abstract = {Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are modern methods to learn the underlying distribution of a data set. GANs have been widely used in sample synthesis, de-noising, domain transfer, etc. GANs, however, are designed in a model-free fashion where no additional information about the underlying distribution is available. In many applications, however, practitioners have access to the underlying independence graph of the variables, either as a Bayesian network or a Markov Random Field (MRF). We ask: how can one use this additional information in designing model-based GANs? In this paper, we provide theoretical foundations to answer this question by studying subadditivity properties of probability divergences, which establish upper bounds on the distance between two high-dimensional distributions by the sum of distances between their marginals over (local) neighborhoods of the graphical structure of the Bayes-net or the MRF. We prove that several popular probability divergences satisfy some notion of subadditivity under mild conditions. These results lead to a principled design of a model-based GAN that uses a set of simple discriminators on the neighborhoods of the Bayes-net/MRF, rather than a giant discriminator on the entire network, providing significant statistical and computational benefits. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the benefits of our principled design of model-based GANs.},

While the issue has been extensively studied empirically, little attention has been paid from a theoretical angle. In this paper, we show that the impact of CF increases as two tasks increasingly align. We introduce a measure of task similarity called the NTK overlap matrix which is at the core of CF. We analyze common projected gradient algorithms and demonstrate how they mitigate forgetting. Then, we propose a variant of Orthogonal Gradient Descent (OGD) which leverages structure of the data through Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

We assume that tokens in the stream are drawn from an unknown discrete distribution, which is endowed with a normalized inverse Gaussian process (NIGP) prior. Then, using distributional properties of the NIGP, we compute the posterior distribution of a token's frequency in the stream, given the hashed data, and in turn corresponding BNP estimates. Applications to synthetic and real data show that our approach achieves a remarkable performance in the estimation of low-frequency tokens. This is known to be a desirable feature in the context of natural language processing, where it is indeed common in the context of the power-law behaviour of the data.},

A fixed step-size scheme defines a family of time-homogeneous Markov chains, parametrized by the step-size. Here, using this formulation, non-asymptotic performance bounds are derived, under Lyapunov conditions. Then, for any step-size, the corresponding Markov chain is proved to admit a unique stationary distribution, and to be geometrically ergodic. This result gives rise to a family of stationary distributions indexed by the step-size, which is further shown to converge to a Dirac measure, concentrated at the solution of the problem at hand, as the step-size goes to 0. Finally, the asymptotic rate of this convergence is established, through an asymptotic expansion of the bias, and a central limit theorem.},

These problems are challenging since the feasible set is typically non-convex and hard to find, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the de facto standard for sample-efficient optimization in unconstrained settings, leaving practitioners with evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that overcomes the above challenges and pushes the applicability of Bayesian optimization far beyond the state-of-the-art. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent results on a variety of benchmarks. To this end, we propose two new control problems that we expect to be of independent value for the scientific community.},

 abstract = { Temporal point-processes are often used for mathematical modeling of sequences of discrete events with asynchronous timestamps. We focus on a class of temporal point-process models called multivariate Wold processes (MWP). These processes are well suited to model real-world communication dynamics. Statistical inference on such processes often requires learning their corresponding parameters using a set of observed timestamps. In this work, we relax some of the restrictive modeling assumptions made in the state-of-the-art and introduce a Bayesian approach for inferring the parameters of MWP. We develop a computationally efficient variational inference algorithm that allows scaling up the approach to high-dimensional processes and long sequences of observations. Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods. },

To this end, we analyze the error in the cumulative reward using a contraction approach. We consider both stochastic and deterministic state transitions for continuous (non-discrete) state and action spaces. This approach doesn't require strong assumptions and can recover the typical quadratic error to the horizon. We prove that branched rollouts can reduce this error and are essential for deterministic transitions to have a Bellman contraction. Our analysis of policy mismatch error also applies to Imitation Learning. In this case, we show that GAN-type learning has an advantage over Behavioral Cloning when its discriminator is well-trained.},

Here we propose to minimise a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) instead, requiring only that the set of transport maps is dense in an $L^2$ sense and demonstrating how this condition can be validated.

This kind of attacks is critical in sensitive applications of federated learning, where data is scarce and the model has high commercial value. We introduce here the first theoretical and experimental analysis of free-rider attacks on federated learning schemes based on iterative parameters aggregation, such as FedAvg or FedProx, and provide formal guarantees for these attacks to converge to the aggregated models of the fair participants. We first show that a straightforward implementation of this attack can be simply achieved by not updating the local parameters during the iterative federated optimization. As this attack can be detected by adopting simple countermeasures at the server level, we subsequently study more complex disguising schemes based on stochastic updates of the free-rider parameters. We demonstrate the proposed strategies on a number of experimental scenarios, in both iid and non-iid settings. We conclude by providing recommendations to avoid free-rider attacks in real world applications of federated learning, especially in sensitive domains where security of data and models is critical.},

To estimate the ATE, a practitioner must then either (a) collect deconfounded data;(b) run a clinical trial; or (c) elucidate further properties of the causal graph that might render the ATE identifiable. In this paper, we consider the benefit of incorporating a large confounded observational dataset (confounder unobserved) alongside a small deconfounded observational dataset (confounder revealed) when estimating the ATE. Our theoretical results suggest that the inclusion of confounded data can significantly reduce the quantity of deconfounded data required to estimate the ATE to within a desired accuracy level. Moreover, in some cases -- say, genetics -- we could imagine retrospectively selecting samples to deconfound. We demonstrate that by actively selecting these samples based upon the (already observed) treatment and outcome, we can reduce sample complexity further. Our theoretical and empirical results establish that the worst-case relative performance of our approach (vs. a natural benchmark) is bounded while our best-case gains are unbounded. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of selective deconfounding using a large real-world dataset related to genetic mutation in cancer.},

In particular, we consider a randomized scheme based on the convex hull of a point set, that returns an unbiased estimator of a $d$-dimensional gradient vector with almost surely bounded norm. We provide multiple efficient instances of our scheme, that are near optimal, and require only $o(d)$ bits of communication at the expense of tolerable increase in error. The instances of our quantization scheme are obtained using the properties of binary error-correcting codes and provide a smooth tradeoff between the communication and the estimation error of quantization. Furthermore, we show that \emph{vqSGD} also offers strong privacy guarantees.},

 abstract = {A graphical model is a structured representation of locally dependent random variables. A traditional method to reason over these random variables is to perform inference using belief propagation. When provided with the true data generating process, belief propagation can infer the optimal posterior probability estimates in tree structured factor graphs. However, in many cases we may only have access to a poor approximation of the data generating process, or we may face loops in the factor graph, leading to suboptimal estimates. In this work we first extend graph neural networks to factor graphs (FG-GNN). We then propose a new hybrid model that runs conjointly a FG-GNN with belief propagation. The FG-GNN receives as input messages from belief propagation at every inference iteration and outputs a corrected version of them. As a result, we obtain a more accurate algorithm that combines the benefits of both belief propagation and graph neural networks. We apply our ideas to error correction decoding tasks, and we show that our algorithm can outperform belief propagation for LDPC codes on bursty channels.},

We provide theoretical guarantees on both the satisfaction of the safety constraint and the near-optimality of the cumulative reward under proper regularity assumptions.

In contrast to the problem of community recovery of a fully observed graph, one often encounters situations when measurements of a graph are made at low-resolution, each measurement integrating across multiple graph nodes. Such low-resolution measurements effectively induce a coarse graph with its own communities. Our objective is to develop conditions on the graph structure, the quantity, and properties of measurements, under which we can recover the community organization in this coarse graph. In this paper, we build on the stochastic block model by mathematically formalizing the coarsening process, and characterizing its impact on the community members and connections. Through this novel setup and modeling, we characterize an error bound for community recovery. The error bound yields simple and closed-form asymptotic conditions to achieve the perfect recovery of the coarse graph communities.},

In the first setting, we consider the $K$ armed mixture bandits, where the mean reward of arm $i \in [K]$, is $μ_i+ \langle α_{i,t},θ^* \rangle $, with $α_{i,t} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ being the known context vector and $μ_i \in [-1,1]$ and $θ^*$ are unknown parameters. We define $\|θ^*\|$ as the problem complexity and consider a sequence of nested hypothesis classes, each positing a different upper bound on $\|θ^*\|$. Exploiting this, we propose Adaptive Linear Bandit (ALB), a novel phase based algorithm that adapts to the true problem complexity, $\|θ^*\|$. We show that ALB achieves regret scaling of $O(\|θ^*\|\sqrt{T})$, where $\|θ^*\|$ is apriori unknown. As a corollary, when $θ^*=0$, ALB recovers the minimax regret for the simple bandit algorithm without such knowledge of $θ^*$. ALB is the first algorithm that uses parameter norm as model section criteria for linear bandits. Prior state of art algorithms \cite{osom} achieve a regret of $O(L\sqrt{T})$, where $L$ is the upper bound on $\|θ^*\|$, fed as an input to the problem. In the second setting, we consider the standard linear bandit problem (with possibly an infinite number of arms) where the sparsity of $θ^*$, denoted by $d^* \leq d$, is unknown to the algorithm. Defining $d^*$ as the problem complexity, we show that ALB achieves $O(d^*\sqrt{T})$ regret, matching that of an oracle who knew the true sparsity level. This methodology is then extended to the case of finitely many arms and similar results are proven. This is the first algorithm that achieves such model selection guarantees. We further verify our results via synthetic and real-data experiments.},

Our main contribution is to provide an approximate minimax theorem for a large class of games where the players pick neural networks including WGAN, StarCraft II, and Blotto Game. Our findings rely on the fact that despite being nonconcave-nonconvex with respect to the neural networks parameters, these games are concave-convex with respect to the actual models (e.g., functions or distributions) represented by these neural networks.},

 abstract = {This papers studies how competition affects machine learning (ML) predictors. As ML becomes more ubiquitous, it is often deployed by companies to compete over customers. For example, digital platforms like Yelp use ML to predict user preference and make recommendations. A service that is more often queried by users, perhaps because it more accurately anticipates user preferences, is also more likely to obtain additional user data (e.g. in the form of a Yelp review). Thus, competing predictors cause feedback loops whereby a predictor's performance impacts what training data it receives and biases its predictions over time. We introduce a flexible model of competing ML predictors that enables both rapid experimentation and theoretical tractability. We show with empirical and mathematical analysis that competition causes predictors to specialize for specific sub-populations at the cost of worse performance over the general population. We further analyze the impact of predictor specialization on the overall prediction quality experienced by users. We show that having too few or too many competing predictors in a market can hurt the overall prediction quality. Our theory is complemented by experiments on several real datasets using popular learning algorithms, such as neural networks and nearest neighbor methods.},

 abstract = { We consider a distributed empirical risk minimization (ERM) optimization problem with communication efficiency and privacy requirements, motivated by the federated learning (FL) framework. We propose a distributed communication-efficient and local differentially private stochastic gradient descent (CLDP-SGD) algorithm and analyze its communication, privacy, and convergence trade-offs. Since each iteration of the CLDP-SGD aggregates the client-side local gradients, we develop (optimal) communication-efficient schemes for mean estimation for several $\ell_p$ spaces under local differential privacy (LDP). To overcome performance limitation of LDP, CLDP-SGD takes advantage of the inherent privacy amplification provided by client subsampling and data subsampling at each selected client (through SGD) as well as the recently developed shuffled model of privacy. For convex loss functions, we prove that the proposed CLDP-SGD algorithm matches the known lower bounds on the \textit{centralized} private ERM while using a finite number of bits per iteration for each client, \emph{i.e.,} effectively getting communication efficiency for âfreeâ. We also provide preliminary experimental results supporting the theory. },

This is problematic, since the original data owner cannot ex-ante anticipate all its future uses by downstream users. This paper explores the upstream ability to preemptively remove the correlations between features and sensitive attributes by mapping features to a fair representation space. Our main result shows that the fairness measured by the demographic parity of the representation distribution can be certified from a finite sample if and only if the chi-squared mutual information between features and representations is finite. Empirically, we find that smoothing the representation distribution provides generalization guarantees of fairness certificates, which improves upon existing fair representation learning approaches. Moreover, we do not observe that smoothing the representation distribution degrades the accuracy of downstream tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods in fair representation learning.},

We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of SGD for different step size selections including constant, decreasing and the recently proposed stochastic Polyak step size. In addition, all of our analysis holds for the arbitrary sampling paradigm, and as such, we are able to give insights into the complexity of minibatching and determine an optimal minibatch size. In particular we recover the best known convergence rates of full gradient descent and single element sampling SGD as a special case. Finally, we show that for models that interpolate the training data, we can dispense of our Expected Residual condition and give state-of-the-art results in this setting.},

In this work, we study stochastic approximation schemes for the hypergradient, which are important when the lower-level problem is empirical risk minimization on a large dataset. The method that we propose is a stochastic variant of the approximate implicit differentiation approach in (Pedregosa, 2016). We provide bounds for the mean square error of the hypergradient approximation, under the assumption that the lower-level problem is accessible only through a stochastic mapping which is a contraction in expectation. In particular, our main bound is agnostic to the choice of the two stochastic solvers employed by the procedure. We provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical analysis and to show the advantage of using stochastic hypergradients in practice.},

Additionally, we prove that Laplacian smoothing is manifold-adaptive: if $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is an $m$-dimensional manifold with $m < d$, then the error rate of Laplacian smoothing (in either estimation or testing) depends only on $m$, in the same way it would if $\mathcal{X}$ were a full-dimensional set in $\mathbb{R}^d$.},

Hence practitioners often collect data for as many covariates as possible to raise the chances of including the relevant confounders. While this addresses the bias, this has the side effect of significantly increasing the number of data samples required to accurately estimate the effect due to the increased dimensionality. In this work, we consider the setting where out of a large number of covariates $X$ that satisfy strong ignorability, an unknown sparse subset $S$ is sufficient to include to achieve zero bias, i.e. $c$-equivalent to $X$. We propose a common objective function involving outcomes across treatment cohorts with nonconvex joint sparsity regularization that is guaranteed to recover $S$ with high probability under a linear outcome model for $Y$ and subgaussian covariates for each of the treatment cohort. This improves the effect estimation sample complexity so that it scales with the cardinality of the sparse subset $S$ and $\log |X|$, as opposed to the cardinality of the full set $X$. We validate our approach with experiments on treatment effect estimation.},

Such global convergence has been shown only for the linear (or linear-type) MDP and linear (or linearizable) reward. In this paper, we study GAIL under general MDP and for nonlinear reward function classes (as long as the objective function is strongly concave with respect to the reward parameter). We characterize the global convergence with a sublinear rate for a broad range of commonly used policy gradient algorithms, all of which are implemented in an alternating manner with stochastic gradient ascent for reward update, including projected policy gradient (PPG)-GAIL, Frank-Wolfe policy gradient (FWPG)-GAIL, trust region policy optimization (TRPO)-GAIL and natural policy gradient (NPG)-GAIL.

These metrics are used to tune the hyperparameters of FOA. We introduce a class of perturbations quantified via a new norm, called *-norm. We show that adding a small perturbation to the objective function has an equivalently small impact on the behavior of any FOA, which suggests that it should have a minor impact on the tuning of the algorithm. However, we show that smoothness and strong convexity can be heavily impacted by arbitrarily small perturbations, leading to excessively conservative tunings and convergence issues. In view of these observations, we propose a notion of continuity of the metrics, which is essential for a robust tuning strategy. Since smoothness and strong convexity are not continuous, we propose a comprehensive study of existing alternative metrics which we prove to be continuous. We describe their mutual relations and provide their guaranteed convergence rates for the Gradient Descent algorithm accordingly tuned. Finally we discuss how our work impacts the theoretical understanding of FOA and their performances.},

 abstract = {Cycle-consistent training is widely used for jointly learning a forward and inverse mapping between two domains of interest without the cumbersome requirement of collecting matched pairs within each domain. In this regard, the implicit assumption is that there exists (at least approximately) a ground-truth bijection such that a given input from either domain can be accurately reconstructed from successive application of the respective mappings. But in many applications no such bijection can be expected to exist and large reconstruction errors can compromise the success of cycle-consistent training. As one important instance of this limitation, we consider practically-relevant situations where there exists a many-to-one or surjective mapping between domains. To address this regime, we develop a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) approach that can be viewed as converting surjective mappings to implicit bijections whereby reconstruction errors in both directions can be minimized, and as a natural byproduct, realistic output diversity can be obtained in the one-to-many direction. As theoretical motivation, we analyze a simplified scenario whereby minima of the proposed CVAE-based energy function align with the recovery of ground-truth surjective mappings. On the empirical side, we consider a synthetic image dataset with known ground-truth, as well as a real-world application involving natural language generation from knowledge graphs and vice versa, a prototypical surjective case. For the latter, our CVAE pipeline can capture such many-to-one mappings during cycle training while promoting textural diversity for graph-to-text tasks.

As such, the class of possible causal DAGs is represented by a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG), which contains both directed and undirected edges. We characterize the minimal additional edge orientations required to identify a given total effect. A recursive algorithm is then developed to enumerate subclasses of DAGs, such that the total effect in each subclass is identified as a distinct functional of the observed distribution.

 abstract = { Marked temporal point processes (MTPP) have emerged as a powerful framework to model the underlying generative mechanism of asynchronous events localized in continuous time. Most existing models and inference methods in MTPP framework consider only the complete observation scenario i.e. the event sequence being modeled is completely observed with no missing events â an ideal setting barely encountered in practice. A recent line of work which considers missing events uses supervised learning techniques which require a missing or observed label for each event. In this work, we provide a novel unsupervised model and inference method for MTPPs in presence of missing events. We first model the generative processes of observed events and missing events using two MTPPs, where the missing events are represented as latent random variables. Then we devise an unsupervised training method that jointly learns both the MTPPs by means of variational inference. Experiments with real datasets show that our modeling and inference frameworks can effectively impute the missing data among the observed events, which in turn enhances its predictive prowess. },

 abstract = {A traditional approach to initialization in deep neural networks (DNNs) is to sample the network weights randomly for preserving the variance of pre-activations. On the other hand, several studies show that during the training process, the distribution of stochastic gradients can be heavy-tailed especially for small batch sizes. In this case, weights and therefore pre-activations can be modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution that has an infinite variance but has a finite (non-integer) fractional moment of order $s$ with $s&lt;2$. Motivated by this fact, we develop initialization schemes for fully connected feed-forward networks that can provably preserve any given moment of order $s \in (0, 2]$ over the layers for a class of activations including ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU, and linear activations. These generalized schemes recover traditional initialization schemes in the limit $s \to 2$ and serve as part of a principled theory for initialization. For all these schemes, we show that the network output admits a finite almost sure limit as the number of layers grows, and the limit is heavy-tailed in some settings. This sheds further light into the origins of heavy tail during signal propagation in DNNs. We prove that the logarithm of the norm of the network outputs, if properly scaled, will converge to a Gaussian distribution with an explicit mean and variance we can compute depending on the activation used, the value of s chosen and the network width. We also prove that our initialization scheme avoids small network output values more frequently compared to traditional approaches. Furthermore, the proposed initialization strategy does not have an extra cost during the training procedure. We show through numerical experiments that our initialization can improve the training and test performance.},

 abstract = {In federated learning, communication cost is often a critical bottleneck to scale up distributed optimization algorithms to collaboratively learn a model from millions of devices with potentially unreliable or limited communication and heterogeneous data distributions. Two notable trends to deal with the communication overhead of federated algorithms are gradient compression and local computation with periodic communication. Despite many attempts, characterizing the relationship between these two approaches has proven elusive. We address this by proposing a set of algorithms with periodical compressed (quantized or sparsified) communication and analyze their convergence properties in both homogeneous and heterogeneous local data distribution settings. For the homogeneous setting, our analysis improves existing bounds by providing tighter convergence rates for both strongly convex and non-convex objective functions. To mitigate data heterogeneity, we introduce a local gradient tracking scheme and obtain sharp convergence rates that match the best-known communication complexities without compression for convex, strongly convex, and nonconvex settings. We complement our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods by several experiments on real-world datasets.},

 abstract = {Many real-life applications involve simultaneously forecasting multiple time series that are hierarchically related via aggregation or disaggregation operations. For instance, commercial organizations often want to forecast inventories simultaneously at store, city, and state levels for resource planning purposes. In such applications, it is important that the forecasts, in addition to being reasonably accurate, are also consistent w.r.t one another. Although forecasting such hierarchical time series has been pursued by economists and data scientists, the current state-of-the-art models use strong assumptions, e.g., all forecasts being unbiased estimates, noise distribution being Gaussian. Besides, state-of-the-art models have not harnessed the power of modern nonlinear models, especially ones based on deep learning. In this paper, we propose using a flexible nonlinear model that optimizes quantile regression loss coupled with suitable regularization terms to maintain the consistency of forecasts across hierarchies. The theoretical framework introduced herein can be applied to any forecasting model with an underlying differentiable loss function. A proof of optimality of our proposed method is also provided. Simulation studies over a range of datasets highlight the efficacy of our approach.},

 abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the success of adaptive (or unified) approaches in estimating symmetric properties of discrete distributions, where one first obtains a distribution estimator independent of the target property, and then plugs the estimator into the target property as the final estimator. Several such approaches have been proposed and proved to be adaptively optimal, i.e. they achieve the optimal sample complexity for a large class of properties within a low accuracy, especially for a large estimation error $\varepsilon\gg n^{-1/3}$ where $n$ is the sample size. In this paper, we characterize the high accuracy limitation, or the penalty for adaptation, for all such approaches. Specifically, we show that under a mild assumption that the distribution estimator is close to the true sorted distribution in expectation, any adaptive approach cannot achieve the optimal sample complexity for every $1$-Lipschitz property within accuracy $\varepsilon \ll n^{-1/3}$. In particular, this result disproves a conjecture in [Acharya et al. 2017] that the profile maximum likelihood (PML) plug-in approach is optimal in property estimation for all ranges of $\varepsilon$, and confirms a conjecture in [Han and Shiragur, 2021] that their competitive analysis of the PML is tight.},

In the stochastic online learning setting, there is a stream of iid data, and the learner is required to predict a label for each instance, and we are interested in the rate of growth of the number of mistakes the learner makes. In the selective sampling variant of this problem, after each prediction, the learner can optionally request to observe the true classification of the point. This introduces a trade-off between the number of these queries and the number of mistakes as a function of the number T of samples in the sequence. This work explores various properties of the optimal trade-off curve, both abstractly (for general VC classes), and more-concretely for several constructed examples that expose important properties of the trade-off. },

Our contribution is two-fold. First, we provide a lower bound showing that linear regret is generally unavoidable in this case, even if there exists a policy that collects well-conditioned data. The lower bound construction uses an MDP with a fixed number of states while the number of actions scales with the ambient dimension. Note that when the horizon is fixed to one, the case of linear stochastic bandits, the linear regret can be avoided. Second, we show that if the learner has oracle access to a policy that collects well-conditioned data then a variant of Lasso fitted Q-iteration enjoys a nearly dimension-free regret of $\tilde{O}( s^{2/3} N^{2/3})$ where $N$ is the number of episodes and $s$ is the sparsity level. This shows that in the large-action setting, the difficulty of learning can be attributed to the difficulty of finding a good exploratory policy.},

In this work, we present adaptive approximate policy iteration (AAPI), a learning scheme which enjoys a $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound for undiscounted, continuing learning in uniformly ergodic MDPs. This is an improvement over the best existing bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$ for the average-reward case with function approximation. Our algorithm and analysis rely on online learning techniques, where value functions are treated as losses. The main technical novelty is the use of a data-dependent adaptive learning rate coupled with a so-called optimistic prediction of upcoming losses.

 abstract = { We propose a differentially private data generation paradigm using random feature representations of kernel mean embeddings when comparing the distribution of true data with that of synthetic data. We exploit the random feature representations for two important benefits. First, we require a minimal privacy cost for training deep generative models. This is because unlike kernel-based distance metrics that require computing the kernel matrix on all pairs of true and synthetic data points, we can detach the data-dependent term from the term solely dependent on synthetic data. Hence, we need to perturb the data-dependent term once and for all and then use it repeatedly during the generator training. Second, we can obtain an analytic sensitivity of the kernel mean embedding as the random features are norm bounded by construction. This removes the necessity of hyper-parameter search for a clipping norm to handle the unknown sensitivity of a generator network. We provide several variants of our algorithm, differentially-private mean embeddings with random features (DP-MERF) to jointly generate labels and input features for datasets such as heterogeneous tabular data and image data. Our algorithm achieves drastically better privacy-utility trade-offs than existing methods when tested on several datasets. },

We investigate the spectral distribution of the conditional FIM, which is the FIM given a single sample, by focusing on fully-connected networks achieving dynamical isometry. Then, while dynamical isometry is known to keep specific backpropagated signals independent of the depth, we find that the parameter space's local metric linearly depends on the depth even under the dynamical isometry. More precisely, we reveal that the conditional FIM's spectrum concentrates around the maximum and the value grows linearly as the depth increases. To examine the spectrum, considering random initialization and the wide limit, we construct an algebraic methodology based on the free probability theory. As a byproduct, we provide an analysis of the solvable spectral distribution in two-hidden-layer cases. Lastly, experimental results verify that the appropriate learning rate for the online training of DNNs is in inverse proportional to depth, which is determined by the conditional FIM's spectrum.},

We provide a learning convergence analysis that yields a finite mistake bound on the number of times performance requirements are not met and can provide strong safety guarantees, by bounding the worst-case state deviation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach for online robust control of nonlinear systems with such learning theoretic and safety guarantees.

We show that these networks can learn discontinuous contact events in a data-efficient manner from noisy observations in settings that are traditionally difficult for black-box approaches and recent physics inspired neural networks.

 abstract = { Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful MCMC algorithm based on simulating Hamiltonian dynamics. Its performance depends strongly on choosing appropriate values for two parameters: the step size used in the simulation, and how long the simulation runs for. The step-size parameter can be tuned using standard adaptive-MCMC strategies, but it is less obvious how to tune the simulation-length parameter. The no-U-turn sampler (NUTS) eliminates this problematic simulation-length parameter, but NUTSâs relatively complex control flow makes it difficult to efficiently run many parallel chains on accelerators such as GPUs. NUTS also spends some extra gradient evaluations relative to HMC in order to decide how long to run each iteration without violating detailed balance. We propose ChEES-HMC, a simple adaptive-MCMC scheme for automatically tuning HMCâs simulation-length parameter, which minimizes a proxy for the autocorrelation of the stateâs second moments. We evaluate ChEES-HMC and NUTS on many tasks, and find that ChEES-HMC typically yields larger effective sample sizes per gradient evaluation than NUTS does. When running many chains on a GPU, ChEES-HMC can also run significantly more gradient evaluations per second than NUTS, allowing it to quickly provide accurate estimates of posterior expectations. },

The core technique introduces a simple robust validation sub-routine, which is used to boost the confidence of inexpensive gradient-based sub-processes.

 abstract = { We study learning algorithms that seek to minimize the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), when all the learner knows is that the losses (and gradients) incurred may be heavy-tailed. We begin by studying a general-purpose estimator of CVaR for potentially heavy-tailed random variables, which is easy to implement in practice, and requires nothing more than finite variance and a distribution function that does not change too fast or slow around just the quantile of interest. With this estimator in hand, we then derive a new learning algorithm which robustly chooses among candidates produced by stochastic gradient-driven sub-processes, obtain excess CVaR bounds, and finally complement the theory with a regression application. },

 abstract = {Off-policy learning is a framework for evaluating and optimizing policies without deploying them, from data collected by another policy. Real-world environments are typically non-stationary and the offline learned policies should adapt to these changes. To address this challenge, we study the novel problem of off-policy optimization in piecewise-stationary contextual bandits. Our proposed solution has two phases. In the offline learning phase, we partition logged data into categorical latent states and learn a near-optimal sub-policy for each state. In the online deployment phase, we adaptively switch between the learned sub-policies based on their performance. This approach is practical and analyzable, and we provide guarantees on both the quality of off-policy optimization and the regret during online deployment. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we compare it to state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Our approach outperforms methods that act only on observed context.},

 abstract = {In the estimation of the causal effect under linear Structural Causal Models (SCMs), it is common practice to first identify the causal structure, estimate the probability distributions, and then calculate the causal effect. However, if the goal is to estimate the causal effect, it is not necessary to fix a single causal structure or probability distributions. In this paper, we first show from a Bayesian perspective that it is Bayes optimal to weight (average) the causal effects estimated under each model rather than estimating the causal effect under a fixed single model. This idea is also known as Bayesian model averaging. Although the Bayesian model averaging is optimal, as the number of candidate models increases, the weighting calculations become computationally hard. We develop an approximation to the Bayes optimal estimator by using Gaussian scale mixture distributions.},

 abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a sample efficient approach to automatically tune the hyperparameters of machine learning models. In practice, one frequently has to solve similar hyperparameter tuning problems sequentially. For example, one might have to tune a type of neural network learned across a series of different classification problems. Recent work on multi-task BO exploits knowledge gained from previous tuning tasks to speed up a new tuning task. However, previous approaches do not account for the fact that BO is a sequential decision making procedure. Hence, there is in general a mismatch between the number of evaluations collected in the current tuning task compared to the number of evaluations accumulated in all previously completed tasks. In this work, we enable multi-task BO to compensate for this mismatch, such that the transfer learning procedure is able to handle different data regimes in a principled way. We propose a new multi-task BO method that learns a set of ordered, non-linear basis functions of increasing complexity via nested drop-out and automatic relevance determination.

The SVM classifier is known to enjoy good generalization properties when the number of support vectors is small compared to the number of training examples. However, recent research has shown that in sufficiently high-dimensional linear classification problems, the SVM can generalize well despite a proliferation of support vectors where all training examples are support vectors. In this paper, we identify new deterministic equivalences for this phenomenon of support vector proliferation, and use them to (1) substantially broaden the conditions under which the phenomenon occurs in high-dimensional settings, and (2) prove a nearly matching converse result.},

We establish a lower bound on the $L_2$ estimation error with respect to the GD iterations, which is away from zero without a delicate scheme of early stopping. In turn, through a comprehensive analysis of $\ell_2$-regularized GD trajectories, we prove that for overparametrized one-hidden-layer ReLU neural network with the $\ell_2$ regularization: (1) the output is close to that of the kernel ridge regression with the corresponding neural tangent kernel; (2) minimax {optimal} rate of $L_2$ estimation error can be achieved.

This problem has been studied extensively when users' preferences do not change over time (static case); an assumption that is often violated in practical settings. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for online non-stationary recommendation systems which allows for temporal uncertainties in the users' preferences. For this model, we propose a user-based CF algorithm, and provide a theoretical analysis of its achievable reward. Compared to related non-stationary multi-armed bandit literature, the main fundamental difficulty in our model lies in the fact that variations in the preferences of a certain user may affect the recommendations for other users severely. We also test our algorithm over real-world datasets, showing its effectiveness in real-world applications. One of the main surprising observations in our experiments is the fact our algorithm outperforms other static algorithms even when preferences do not change over time. This hints toward the general conclusion that in practice, dynamic algorithms, such as the one we propose, might be beneficial even in stationary environments.},

The primary motivation for using entropy is for exploration and disambiguating optimal policies; however, the theoretical effects are not entirely understood. In this work, we study the more general regularized RL objective and using Fenchel duality; we derive the dual problem which takes the form of an adversarial reward problem. In particular, we find that the optimal policy found by a regularized objective is precisely an optimal policy of a reinforcement learning problem under a worst-case adversarial reward. Our result allows us to reinterpret the popular entropic regularization scheme as a form of robustification. Furthermore, due to the generality of our results, we apply to other existing regularization schemes. Our results thus give insights into the effects of regularization of policies and deepen our understanding of exploration through robust rewards at large.},

In this paper we argue that the GGN approximation should be understood as a local linearization of the underlying Bayesian neural network (BNN), which turns the BNN into a generalized linear model (GLM). Because we use this linearized model for posterior inference, we should also predict using this modified model instead of the original one. We refer to this modified predictive as "GLM predictive" and show that it effectively resolves common underfitting problems of the Laplace approximation. It extends previous results in this vein to general likelihoods and has an equivalent Gaussian process formulation, which enables alternative inference schemes for BNNs in function space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several standard classification datasets as well as on out-of-distribution detection.

The naive approach to data deletion is to retrain the ML model on the remaining data, but this is too time consuming. Moreover there is no known efficient algorithm that exactly deletes data from most ML models. In this work, we evaluate several approaches for approximate data deletion from trained models. For the case of linear regression, we propose a new method with linear dependence on the feature dimension $d$, a significant gain over all existing methods which all have superlinear time dependence on the dimension.

Our method first learns a continuous embedding of the discrete space using a surjective map and subsequently learns a bijective transformation from the continuous space to an approximately Gaussian distributed latent variable.

Consequently, multiple techniques have been proposed that leverage label-invariant transformations of the input (i.e., an input manifold) to improve worst-case confidence calibration. However, manifold-based confidence calibration techniques generally do not scale and/or require expensive retraining when applied to models with large input spaces (e.g., ImageNet). In this paper, we present the recursive lossy label-invariant calibration (ReCal) technique that leverages label-invariant transformations of the input that induce a loss of discriminatory information to recursively group (and calibrate) inputs - without requiring model retraining. We show that ReCal outperforms other calibration methods on multiple datasets, especially, on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet.},

 abstract = {Adversarial training provides a principled approach for training robust neural networks. From an optimization perspective, adversarial training is essentially solving a bilevel optimization problem. The leader problem is trying to learn a robust classifier, while the follower problem is trying to generate adversarial samples. Unfortunately, such a bilevel problem is difficult to solve due to its highly complicated structure. This work proposes a new adversarial training method based on a generic learning-to-learn (L2L) framework. Specifically, instead of applying existing hand-designed algorithms for the inner problem, we learn an optimizer, which is parametrized as a convolutional neural network. At the same time, a robust classifier is learned to defense the adversarial attack generated by the learned optimizer. Experiments over CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets demonstrate that L2L outperforms existing adversarial training methods in both classification accuracy and computational efficiency. Moreover, our L2L framework can be extended to generative adversarial imitation learning and stabilize the training.},

Despite this, there has been surprisingly little progress made in ways to mitigate the effects of the sampling bias that arises. We focus on generalized linear models and show that without adjusting for this sampling bias, the model may converge suboptimally or even fail to converge to the optimal solution. We propose an adaptive approach that comes with theoretical guarantees and show that it outperforms several existing methods empirically. Our method leverages variance estimation techniques to efficiently learn under uncertainty, offering a more principled alternative compared to existing approaches.},

GGP generates $S$ latent states that are shared by $K$ different communities, each of which is characterized by its own pattern of activation probabilities imposed on a $S\times S$ directed sparse graph, and allow both $S$ and $K$ to grow without bound. For temporal pattern discovery, the latent representation under the model is used to decompose the time series into a parsimonious set of multivariate sub-sequences generated by formed communities. In each sub-sequence, different data dimensions often share similar temporal patterns but may exhibit distinct magnitudes, and hence allowing the superposition of all sub-sequences to exhibit diverse behaviors at different data dimensions. On both synthetic and real-world time series, the proposed nonparametric Bayesian dynamic models, which are initialized at random, consistently exhibit good predictive performance in comparison to a variety of baseline models, revealing interpretable latent state transition patterns and decomposing the time series into distinctly behaved sub-sequences. },

(2019) can fail to capture "natural" invariances, at least when used in its practical "linear" form, and even on very simple problems which directly follow the motivating examples for IRM. This can lead to worse generalization on new environments, even when compared to unconstrained ERM. The issue stems from a significant gap between the linear variant (as in their concrete method IRMv1) and the full non-linear IRM formulation. Additionally, even when capturing the "right" invariances, we show that it is possible for IRM to learn a sub-optimal predictor, due to the loss function not being invariant across environments. The issues arise even when measuring invariance on the population distributions, but are exacerbated by the fact that IRM is extremely fragile to sampling.},

 abstract = {The dominant term in PAC-Bayes bounds is often the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the posterior and prior. For so-called linear PAC-Bayes risk bounds based on the empirical risk of a fixed posterior kernel, it is possible to minimize the expected value of the bound by choosing the prior to be the expected posterior, which we call the oracle prior on the account that it is distribution dependent. In this work, we show that the bound based on the oracle prior can be suboptimal: In some cases, a stronger bound is obtained by using a data-dependent oracle prior, i.e., a conditional expectation of the posterior, given a subset of the training data that is then excluded from the empirical risk term. While using data to learn a prior is a known heuristic, its essential role in optimal bounds is new. In fact, we show that using data can mean the difference between vacuous and nonvacuous bounds. We apply this new principle in the setting of nonconvex learning, simulating data-dependent oracle priors on MNIST and Fashion MNIST with and without held-out data, and demonstrating new nonvacuous bounds in both cases.},

 abstract = {The Frank-Wolfe method solves smooth constrained convex optimization problems at a generic sublinear rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$, and it (or its variants) enjoys accelerated convergence rates for two fundamental classes of constraints: polytopes and strongly-convex sets. Uniformly convex sets non-trivially subsume strongly convex sets and form a large variety of \textit{curved} convex sets commonly encountered in machine learning and signal processing. For instance, the $\ell_p$-balls are uniformly convex for all $p > 1$, but strongly convex for $p\in]1,2]$ only. We show that these sets systematically induce accelerated convergence rates for the original Frank-Wolfe algorithm, which continuously interpolate between known rates. Our accelerated convergence rates emphasize that it is the curvature of the constraint sets -- not just their strong convexity -- that leads to accelerated convergence rates. These results also importantly highlight that the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is adaptive to much more generic constraint set structures, thus explaining faster empirical convergence. Finally, we also show accelerated convergence rates when the set is only locally uniformly convex and provide similar results in online linear optimization.},

 abstract = {Two apparently unrelated fields -- normalizing flows and causality -- have recently received considerable attention in the machine learning community. In this work, we highlight an intrinsic correspondence between a simple family of autoregressive normalizing flows and identifiable causal models. We exploit the fact that autoregressive flow architectures define an ordering over variables, analogous to a causal ordering, to show that they are well-suited to performing a range of causal inference tasks, ranging from causal discovery to making interventional and counterfactual predictions. First, we show that causal models derived from both affine and additive autoregressive flows with fixed orderings over variables are identifiable, i.e. the true direction of causal influence can be recovered. This provides a generalization of the additive noise model well-known in causal discovery. Second, we derive a bivariate measure of causal direction based on likelihood ratios, leveraging the fact that flow models can estimate normalized log-densities of data. Third, we demonstrate that flows naturally allow for direct evaluation of both interventional and counterfactual queries, the latter case being possible due to the invertible nature of flows. Finally, throughout a series of experiments on synthetic and real data, the proposed method is shown to outperform current approaches for causal discovery as well as making accurate interventional and counterfactual predictions.},

Despite the widespread use of tree based variable importance measures, pinning down their theoretical properties has been challenging and therefore largely unexplored. To address this gap between theory and practice, we derive finite sample performance guarantees for variable selection in nonparametric models using a single-level CART decision tree (a decision stump). Under standard operating assumptions in variable screening literature, we find that the marginal signal strength of each variable and ambient dimensionality can be considerably weaker and higher, respectively, than state-of-the-art nonparametric variable selection methods. Furthermore, unlike previous marginal screening methods that attempt to directly estimate each marginal projection via a truncated basis expansion, the fitted model used here is a simple, parsimonious decision stump, thereby eliminating the need for tuning the number of basis terms. Thus, surprisingly, even though decision stumps are highly inaccurate for estimation purposes, they can still be used to perform consistent model selection.},

In this paper, we revisit a historically important random forest model originally proposed by Breiman in 2004 and later studied by Gérard Biau in 2012, where a feature is selected at random and the splits occurs at the midpoint of the node along the chosen feature. If the regression function is Lipschitz and depends only on a small subset of $ S $ out of $ d $ features, we show that, given access to $ n $ observations and properly tuned split probabilities, the mean-squared prediction error is $ O((n(\log n)^{(S-1)/2})^{-\frac{1}{S\log2+1}}) $. This positively answers an outstanding question of Biau about whether the rate of convergence for this random forest model could be improved. Furthermore, by a refined analysis of the approximation and estimation errors for linear models, we show that this rate cannot be improved in general. Finally, we generalize our analysis and improve extant prediction error bounds for another random forest model in which each tree is constructed from subsampled data and the splits are performed at the empirical median along a chosen feature.},

Our approach is inductive (as opposed to deductive) in that it depends on the data generating distribution solely through some nonparametric properties revealing associations in the data, and does not require having enough data to fully characterize the true joint distributions $P_{x, y}$. Specifically, our approach consists of (i) noting that $I\left(y; x\right) = I\left(u_y; u_x\right)$ where $u_y$ and $u_x$ are the copula-uniform dual representations of $y$ and $x$ (i.e. their images under the probability integral transform), and (ii) estimating the copula entropies $h\left(u_y\right)$, $h\left(u_x\right)$ and $h\left(u_y, u_x\right)$ by solving a maximum-entropy problem over the space of copula densities under a constraint of the type $\alpha_m = E\left[\phi_m(u_y, u_x)\right]$. We prove that, so long as the constraint is feasible, this problem admits a unique solution, it is in the exponential family, and it can be learned by solving a convex optimization problem. The resulting estimator, which we denote MIND, is marginal-invariant, always non-negative, unbounded for any sample size $n$, consistent, has MSE rate $O(1/n)$, and is more data-efficient than competing approaches. Beyond mutual information estimation, we illustrate that our approach may be used to mitigate mode collapse in GANs by maximizing the entropy of the copula of fake samples, a model we refer to as Copula Entropy Regularized GAN (CER-GAN).},

In particular, a significant research effort was put on projection-free methods for online learning. In this paper we revisit the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW) method suggested by Hazan and Kale \cite{Hazan12} and fill a gap that has been left unnoticed for several years: OFW achieves a faster rate of $O(T^{2/3})$ on strongly convex functions (as opposed to the standard $O(T^{3/4})$ for convex but not strongly convex functions), where $T$ is the sequence length. This is somewhat surprising since it is known that for offline optimization, in general, strong convexity does not lead to faster rates for Frank-Wolfe. We also revisit the bandit setting under strong convexity and prove a similar bound of $\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ (instead of $O(T^{3/4})$ without strong convexity). Hence, in the current state-of-affairs, the best projection-free upper-bounds for the full-information and bandit settings with strongly convex and nonsmooth functions match up to logarithmic factors in $T$.},

 abstract = {Standard approaches to group-based notions of fairness, such as \emph{parity} and \emph{equalized odds}, try to equalize absolute measures of performance across known groups (based on race, gender, etc.). Consequently, a group that is inherently harder to classify may hold back the performance on other groups; and no guarantees can be provided for unforeseen groups. Instead, we propose a fairness notion whose guarantee, on each group $g$ in a class $\mathcal{G}$, is relative to the performance of the best classifier on $g$. We apply this notion to broad classes of groups, in particular, where (a) $\mathcal{G}$ consists of all possible groups (subsets) in the data, and (b) $\mathcal{G}$ is more streamlined. 
For the first setting, which is akin to groups being completely unknown, we devise the {\sc PF} (Proportional Fairness) classifier, which guarantees, on any possible group $g$, an accuracy that is proportional to that of the optimal classifier for $g$, scaled by the relative size of $g$ in the data set. Due to including all possible groups, some of which could be too complex to be relevant, the worst-case theoretical guarantees here have to be proportionally weaker for smaller subsets. 
For the second setting, we devise the {\sc BeFair} (Best-effort Fair) framework which seeks an accuracy, on every $g \in \mathcal{G}$, which approximates that of the optimal classifier on $g$, independent of the size of $g$. Aiming for such a guarantee results in a non-convex problem, and we design novel techniques to get around this difficulty when $\mathcal{G}$ is the set of linear hypotheses. We test our algorithms on real-world data sets, and present interesting comparative insights on their performance.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of monotone, submodular maximization over a ground set of size $n$ subject to cardinality constraint $k$. For this problem, we introduce the first deterministic algorithms with linear time complexity; these algorithms are streaming algorithms. Our single-pass algorithm obtains a constant ratio in $\lceil n / c \rceil + c$ oracle queries, for any $c \ge 1$. In addition, we propose a deterministic, multi-pass streaming algorithm with a constant number of passes that achieves nearly the optimal ratio with linear query and time complexities. We prove a lower bound that implies no constant-factor approximation exists using $o(n)$ queries, even if queries to infeasible sets are allowed. An empirical analysis demonstrates that our algorithms require fewer queries (often substantially less than $n$) yet still achieve better objective value than the current state-of-the-art algorithms, including single-pass, multi-pass, and non-streaming algorithms.},

 abstract = {Tractable contextual bandit algorithms often rely on the realizability assumption--i.e., that the true expected reward model belongs to a known class, such as linear functions. We investigate issues that arise in the absence of realizability and note that the dynamics of adaptive data collection can lead commonly used bandit algorithms to learn a suboptimal policy. In this work, we present a tractable bandit algorithm that is not sensitive to the realizability assumption and computationally reduces to solving a constrained regression problem in every epoch. When realizability does not hold, our algorithm ensures the same guarantees on regret achieved by realizability-based algorithms under realizability, up to an additive term that accounts for the misspecification error. This extra term is proportional to T times the 2â „5-root of the mean squared error between the best model in the class and the true model, where T is the total number of time-steps. Our work sheds light on the bias-variance trade-off for tractable contextual bandits. This trade-off is not captured by algorithms that assume realizability, since under this assumption there exists an estimator in the class that attains zero bias.},

 abstract = {Models leak information about their training data. This enables attackers to infer sensitive information about their training sets, notably determine if a data sample was part of the model’s training set. The existing works empirically show the possibility of these membership inference (tracing) attacks against complex deep learning models. However, the attack results are dependent on the specific training data, can be obtained only after the tedious process of training the model and performing the attack, and are missing any measure of the confidence and unused potential power of the attack. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the maximum power of tracing attacks against high-dimensional graphical models, with the focus on Bayesian networks. We provide a tight upper bound on the power (true positive rate) of these attacks, with respect to their error (false positive rate), for a given model structure even before learning its parameters. As it should be, the bound is independent of the knowledge and algorithm of any specific attack. It can help in identifying which model structures leak more information, how adding new parameters to the model increases its privacy risk, and what can be gained by adding new data points to decrease the overall information leakage. It provides a measure of the potential leakage of a model given its structure, as a function of the model complexity and the size of the training set.},

Furthermore, under certain smooth assumptions on the data distribution, we establish a rigorous bound on the complexity for approximately teaching a Gaussian kernel perceptron.

Unlike the standard likelihood weighting, CS-LW is based on partial assignments of random variables and requires fewer samples for convergence due to the sampling variance reduction. Furthermore, the speed of generating samples increases. Our novel notion of contextual assignments theoretically justifies CS-LW.

This approach is not only loose, in that it does not capture that EM can make more progress than a gradient step, but the assumptions fail to hold for textbook examples of EM like Gaussian mixtures. In this work we first show that for the common setting of exponential family distributions, viewing EM as a mirror descent algorithm leads to convergence rates in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Then, we show how the KL divergence is related to first-order stationarity via Bregman divergences. In contrast to previous works, the analysis is invariant to the choice of parametrization and holds with minimal assumptions. We also show applications of these ideas to local linear (and superlinear) convergence rates, generalized EM, and non-exponential family distributions.},

Estimating DShapley is computationally expensive, however, and this can be a major challenge to using it in practice. Moreover, there has been little mathematical analyses of how this value depends on data characteristics. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expressions for DShapley for the canonical problems of linear regression, binary classification, and non-parametric density estimation. These analytic forms provide new algorithms to estimate DShapley that are several orders of magnitude faster than previous state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our formulas are directly interpretable and provide quantitative insights into how the value varies for different types of data.

 abstract = {We study the convergence rates of the EM algorithm for learning two-component mixed linear regression under all regimes of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We resolve a long-standing question that many recent results have attempted to tackle: we completely characterize the convergence behavior of EM, and show that the EM algorithm achieves minimax optimal sample complexity under all SNR regimes. In particular, when the SNR is sufficiently large, the EM updates converge to the true parameter $\theta^{*}$ at the standard parametric convergence rate $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/2})$ after $\mathcal{O}(\log(n/d))$ iterations. In the regime where the SNR is above $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$ and below some constant, the EM iterates converge to a $\mathcal{O}({\rm SNR}^{-1} (d/n)^{1/2})$ neighborhood of the true parameter, when the number of iterations is of the order $\mathcal{O}({\rm SNR}^{-2} \log(n/d))$. In the low SNR regime where the SNR is below $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$, we show that EM converges to a $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$ neighborhood of the true parameters, after $\mathcal{O}((n/d)^{1/2})$ iterations. Notably, these results are achieved under mild conditions of either random initialization or an efficiently computable local initialization. By providing tight convergence guarantees of the EM algorithm in middle-to-low SNR regimes, we fill the remaining gap in the literature, and significantly, reveal that in low SNR, EM changes rate, matching the $n^{-1/4}$ rate of the MLE, a behavior that previous work had been unable to show.},

 abstract = {Machine learning and data mining algorithms have been increasingly used recently to support decision-making systems in many areas of high societal importance such as healthcare, education, or security. While being very efficient in their predictive abilities, the deployed algorithms sometimes tend to learn an inductive model with a discriminative bias due to the presence of this latter in the learning sample. This problem gave rise to a new field of algorithmic fairness where the goal is to correct the discriminative bias introduced by a certain attribute in order to decorrelate it from the model's output. In this paper, we study the problem of fairness for the task of edge prediction in graphs, a largely underinvestigated scenario compared to a more popular setting of fair classification. To this end, we formulate the problem of fair edge prediction, analyze it theoretically, and propose an embedding-agnostic repairing procedure for the adjacency matrix of an arbitrary graph with a trade-off between the group and individual fairness. We experimentally show the versatility of our approach and its capacity to provide explicit control over different notions of fairness and prediction accuracy.},

A downside to this approach is that each layer (or module, as multiple modules can operate in parallel) is tasked with processing the entire hidden state, rather than a particular part of the state which is most relevant for that module. Methods which only operate on a small number of input variables are an essential part of most programming languages, and they allow for improved modularity and code re-usability. Our proposed method, Neural Function Modules (NFM), aims to introduce the same structural capability into deep learning. Most of the work in the context of feed-forward networks combining top-down and bottom-up feedback is limited to classification problems. The key contribution of our work is to combine attention, sparsity, top-down and bottom-up feedback, in a flexible algorithm which, as we show, improves the results in standard classification, out-of-domain generalization, generative modeling, and learning representations in the context of reinforcement learning.},

Indeed, intuitively $G$ has less mechanisms to adapt, but this justification is incomplete. Our contribution is a more thorough analysis of this hypothesis. We investigate the adaptation speed of cause-effect SCMs. Using convergence rates from stochastic optimization, we justify that a relevant proxy for adaptation speed is distance in parameter space after intervention. Applying this proxy to categorical and normal cause-effect models, we show two results. When the intervention is on the cause variable, the SCM with the correct causal direction is advantaged by a large factor. When the intervention is on the effect variable, we characterize the relative adaptation speed. Surprisingly, we find situations where the anticausal model is advantaged, falsifying the initial hypothesis. Code to reproduce experiments is available at this https URL},

 abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) theory provides powerful tools to compare probability measures. However, OT is limited to nonnegative measures having the same mass, and suffers serious drawbacks about its computation and statistics. This leads to several proposals of regularized variants of OT in the recent literature. In this work, we consider an \textit{entropy partial transport} (EPT) problem for nonnegative measures on a tree having different masses. The EPT is shown to be equivalent to a standard complete OT problem on a one-node extended tree. We derive its dual formulation, then leverage this to propose a novel regularization for EPT which admits fast computation and negative definiteness. To our knowledge, the proposed regularized EPT is the first approach that yields a \textit{closed-form} solution among available variants of unbalanced OT. For practical applications without priori knowledge about the tree structure for measures, we propose tree-sliced variants of the regularized EPT, computed by averaging the regularized EPT between these measures using random tree metrics, built adaptively from support data points. Exploiting the negative definiteness of our regularized EPT, we introduce a positive definite kernel, and evaluate it against other baselines on benchmark tasks such as document classification with word embedding and topological data analysis. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that our regularization also provides effective approximations.},

GW suffers however from a computational drawback since it requires to solve a complex non-convex quadratic program. We consider in this work a specific family of cost metrics, namely \textit{tree metrics} for a space of supports of each probability measure, and aim for developing efficient and scalable discrepancies between the probability measures. By leveraging a tree structure, we propose to align \textit{flows} from a root to each support instead of pair-wise tree metrics of supports, i.e., flows from a support to another, in GW. Consequently, we propose a novel discrepancy, named Flow-based Alignment (\FlowAlign), by matching the flows of the probability measures. We show that \FlowAlign~shares a similar structure as a univariate optimal transport distance. Therefore, \FlowAlign~is fast for computation and scalable for large-scale applications. By further exploring tree structures, we propose a variant of \FlowAlign, named Depth-based Alignment (\DepthAlign), by aligning the flows hierarchically along each depth level of the tree structures. Theoretically, we prove that both \FlowAlign~and \DepthAlign~are pseudo-distances. Moreover, we also derive tree-sliced variants, computed by averaging the corresponding \FlowAlign~/ \DepthAlign~using random tree metrics, built adaptively in spaces of supports. Empirically, we test our proposed discrepancies against other baselines on some benchmark tasks.},

 abstract = {Integration of data from multiple omics techniques is becoming increasingly important in biomedical research. Due to non-uniformity and technical limitations in omics platforms, such integrative analyses on multiple omics, which we refer to as views, involve learning from incomplete observations with various view-missing patterns. This is challenging because i) complex interactions within and across observed views need to be properly addressed for optimal predictive power and ii) observations with various view-missing patterns need to be flexibly integrated. To address such challenges, we propose a deep variational information bottleneck (IB) approach for incomplete multi-view observations. Our method applies the IB framework on marginal and joint representations of the observed views to focus on intra-view and inter-view interactions that are relevant for the target. Most importantly, by modeling the joint representations as a product of marginal representations, we can efficiently learn from observed views with various view-missing patterns. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method consistently achieves gain from data integration and outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

Algorithms for learning MFE in dynamic MFGs are unknown in general. Our focus is on an important subclass that possess a monotonicity property called Strategic Complementarities (MFG-SC). We introduce a natural refinement to the equilibrium concept that we call Trembling-Hand-Perfect MFE (T-MFE), which allows agents to employ a measure of randomization while accounting for the impact of such randomization on their payoffs. We propose a simple algorithm for computing T-MFE under a known model. We also introduce a model-free and a model-based approach to learning T-MFE and provide sample complexities of both algorithms. We also develop a fully online learning scheme that obviates the need for a simulator. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms via examples motivated by real-world applications.},

 abstract = {Phase I clinical trials are designed to test the safety (non-toxicity) of drugs and find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). This task becomes significantly more challenging when multiple-drug dose-combinations (DC) are involved, due to the inherent conflict between the exponentially increasing DC candidates and the limited patient budget. This paper proposes a novel Bayesian design, SDF-Bayes, for finding the MTD for drug combinations in the presence of safety constraints. Rather than the conventional principle of escalating or de-escalating the current dose of one drug (perhaps alternating between drugs), SDF-Bayes proceeds by cautious optimism: it chooses the next DC that, on the basis of current information, is most likely to be the MTD (optimism), subject to the constraint that it only chooses DCs that have a high probability of being safe (caution). We also propose an extension, SDF-Bayes-AR, that accounts for patient heterogeneity and enables heterogeneous patient recruitment. Extensive experiments based on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the advantages of SDF-Bayes over state of the art DC trial designs in terms of accuracy and safety.},

 abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive successes yet often requires a very large amount of interaction data. This result is perhaps unsurprising, as using complicated function approximation often requires more data to fit, and early theoretical results on linear Markov decision processes provide regret bounds that scale with the dimension of the linear approximation. Ideally, we would like to automatically identify the minimal dimension of the approximation that is sufficient to encode an optimal policy. Towards this end, we consider the problem of model selection in RL with function approximation, given a set of candidate RL algorithms with known regret guarantees. The learner's goal is to adapt to the complexity of the optimal algorithm without knowing it \textit{a priori}. We present a meta-algorithm that successively rejects increasingly complex models using a simple statistical test. Given at least one candidate that satisfies realizability, we prove the meta-algorithm adapts to the optimal complexity with $\tilde{O}(L^{5/6} T^{2/3})$ regret compared to the optimal candidate's $\tilde{O}(\sqrt T)$ regret, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $L$ is the number of algorithms. The dimension and horizon dependencies remain optimal with respect to the best candidate, and our meta-algorithmic approach is flexible to incorporate multiple candidate algorithms and models. Finally, we show that the meta-algorithm automatically admits significantly improved instance-dependent regret bounds that depend on the gaps between the maximal values attainable by the candidates.},

Specifically, \cite{DISZ17, LiangS18} show last iterate convergence of the so called "Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent" for the case of \textit{unconstrained} min-max optimization. Moreover, in \cite{Metal} the authors show that Mirror Descent with an extra gradient step displays last iterate convergence for convex-concave problems (both constrained and unconstrained), though their algorithm does not follow the online learning framework; it uses extra information rather than \textit{only} the history to compute the next iteration. In this work, we show that "Optimistic Multiplicative-Weights Update (OMWU)" which follows the no-regret online learning framework, exhibits last iterate convergence locally for convex-concave games, generalizing the results of \cite{DP19} where last iterate convergence of OMWU was shown only for the \textit{bilinear case}. We complement our results with experiments that indicate fast convergence of the method.},

 abstract = {Much work has been done recently to make neural networks more interpretable, and one approach is to arrange for the network to use only a subset of the available features. In linear models, Lasso (or ℓ1-regularized) regression assigns zero weights to the most irrelevant or redundant features, and is widely used in data science. However the Lasso only applies to linear models. Here we introduce LassoNet, a neural network framework with global feature selection. Our approach achieves feature sparsity by allowing a feature to participate in a hidden unit only if its linear representative is active. Unlike other approaches to feature selection for neural nets, our method uses a modified objective function with constraints, and so integrates feature selection with the parameter learning directly. As a result, it delivers an entire regularization path of solutions with a range of feature sparsity. In experiments with real and simulated data, LassoNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for feature selection and regression. The LassoNet method uses projected proximal gradient descent, and generalizes directly to deep networks. It can be implemented by adding just a few lines of code to a standard neural network.},

Based on this view, we present PClean, a probabilistic programming language for leveraging dataset-specific knowledge to clean and normalize dirty data. PClean is powered by three modeling and inference contributions: (1) a non-parametric model of relational database instances, customizable via probabilistic programs, (2) a sequential Monte Carlo inference algorithm that exploits the model's structure, and (3) near-optimal SMC proposals and blocked Gibbs rejuvenation moves constructed on a per-dataset basis. We show empirically that short (< 50-line) PClean programs can be faster and more accurate than generic PPL inference on multiple data-cleaning benchmarks; perform comparably in terms of accuracy and runtime to state-of-the-art data-cleaning systems (unlike generic PPL inference given the same runtime); and scale to real-world datasets with millions of records.},

Under certain regularity conditions (that are also assumed by existing works), we show an $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-\frac{5}{2}})$ complexity result for a problem with a nonconvex objective and affine equality constraints and an $\tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ complexity result for a problem with a nonconvex objective and nonconvex constraints, where the complexity is measured by the number of first-order oracles to yield an $\varepsilon$-KKT solution. Both results are the best known. The same-order complexity results have been achieved by penalty methods.

Our improved iALM and analysis close the gap between theory and practice.

 abstract = { The commonly used Gaussian kernel has a tuning parameter $\gamma$. This makes the design of quantization schemes for random Fourier features (RFF) challenging, which is a popular technique to approximate the Gaussian kernel. Intuitively one would expect that a different quantizer is needed for a different $\gamma$ value (and we need to store a different set of quantized data for each $\gamma$). Fortunately, the recent workÂ \citep{Report:Li_2021_RFF} showed that only one Lloyd-Max (LM) quantizer is needed as the marginal distribution of RFF is free of the tuning parameter $\gamma$. On the other hand, \citet{Report:Li_2021_RFF} still required to store a different set of quantized data for each $\gamma$ value. In this paper, we adopt the âone-sketch-for-allâ strategy for quantizing RFFs. Basically, we only store one set of quantized data after applying random projections on the original data. From the same set of quantized data, we can construct approximate RFFs to approximate Gaussian kernels for any tuning parameter $\gamma$. Compared with \citet{Report:Li_2021_RFF}, our proposed scheme would lose some accuracy as one would expect. Nevertheless, the proposed method still perform noticeably better than the quantization scheme based on random rounding. We provide statistical analysis on the properties of the proposed method and experiments are conducted to empirically illustrate its effectiveness. },

In particular, we show that the projection-based boundary blackbox attacks are able to achieve much smaller magnitude of perturbations with 100% attack success rate based on efficient queries. Both linear and nonlinear projections demonstrate their advantages under different conditions.

 abstract = {Machine learning is increasingly being used to generate prediction models for use in a number of real-world settings, from credit risk assessment to clinical decision support. Recent discussions have highlighted potential problems in the updating of a predictive score for a binary outcome when an existing predictive score forms part of the standard workflow, driving interventions. In this setting, the existing score induces an additional causative pathway which leads to miscalibration when the original score is replaced. We propose a general causal framework to describe and address this problem, and demonstrate an equivalent formulation as a partially observed Markov decision process. We use this model to demonstrate the impact of such `naive updating' when performed repeatedly. Namely, we show that successive predictive scores may converge to a point where they predict their own effect, or may eventually tend toward a stable oscillation between two values, and we argue that neither outcome is desirable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that even if model-fitting procedures improve, actual performance may worsen. We complement these findings with a discussion of several potential routes to overcome these issues.},

 abstract = {Optimal transport (OT) distances are increasingly used as loss functions for statistical inference, notably in the learning of generative models or supervised learning. Yet, the behavior of minimum Wasserstein estimators is poorly understood, notably in high-dimensional regimes or under model misspecification. In this work we adopt the viewpoint of projection robust (PR) OT, which seeks to maximize the OT cost between two measures by choosing a $k$-dimensional subspace onto which they can be projected. Our first contribution is to establish several fundamental statistical properties of PR Wasserstein distances, complementing and improving previous literature that has been restricted to one-dimensional and well-specified cases. Next, we propose the integral PR Wasserstein (IPRW) distance as an alternative to the PRW distance, by averaging rather than optimizing on subspaces. Our complexity bounds can help explain why both PRW and IPRW distances outperform Wasserstein distances empirically in high-dimensional inference tasks. Finally, we consider parametric inference using the PRW distance. We provide an asymptotic guarantee of two types of minimum PRW estimators and formulate a central limit theorem for max-sliced Wasserstein estimator under model misspecification. To enable our analysis on PRW with projection dimension larger than one, we devise a novel combination of variational analysis and statistical theory.},

 abstract = {The privacy implications of generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a topic of great interest, leading to several recent algorithms for training GANs with privacy guarantees. By drawing connections to the generalization properties of GANs, we prove that under some assumptions, GAN-generated samples inherently satisfy some (weak) privacy guarantees. First, we show that if a GAN is trained on m samples and used to generate n samples, the generated samples are (epsilon, delta)-differentially-private for (epsilon, delta) pairs where delta scales as O(n/m). We show that under some special conditions, this upper bound is tight. Next, we study the robustness of GAN-generated samples to membership inference attacks. We model membership inference as a hypothesis test in which the adversary must determine whether a given sample was drawn from the training dataset or from the underlying data distribution. We show that this adversary can achieve an area under the ROC curve that scales no better than O(m^{-1/4}).},

We cast this question as a distribution view by introducing the \emph{signed measure}, which transforms positive decomposition to measure decomposition: a series of non-PD kernels can be associated with the linear combination of specific finite Borel measures. In this manner, our distribution-based framework provides a sufficient and necessary condition to answer this open question. Specifically, this solution is also computationally implementable in practice to scale non-PD kernels in large sample cases, which allows us to devise the first random features algorithm to obtain an unbiased estimator. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our algorithm over the existing methods.},

By establishing a bias-variance decomposition of the expected excess risk, we show that, while the bias is (almost) independent of d and monotonically decreases with n, the variance depends on n, d and can be unimodal or monotonically decreasing under different regularization schemes. Our refined analysis goes beyond the double descent theory by showing that, depending on the data eigen-profile and the level of regularization, the kernel regression risk curve can be a double-descent-like, bell-shaped, or monotonic function of n.

Existing theoretical analysis shows that PATE consistently learns any VC-classes in the realizable setting, but falls short in explaining its success in more general cases where the error rate of the optimal classifier is bounded away from zero. We fill in this gap by introducing the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) and establish stronger and more interpretable learning bounds. These bounds provide new insights into when PATE works and improve over existing results even in the narrower realizable setting. We also investigate the compelling idea of using active learning for saving privacy budget, and empirical studies show the effectiveness of this new idea. The novel components in the proofs include a more refined analysis of the majority voting classifier - which could be of independent interest - and an observation that the synthetic "student" learning problem is nearly realizable by construction under the Tsybakov noise condition.},

 abstract = {Due to the over-parameterization nature, neural networks are a powerful tool for nonlinear function approximation. In order to achieve good generalization on unseen data, a suitable inductive bias is of great importance for neural networks. One of the most straightforward ways is to regularize the neural network with some additional objectives. L2 regularization serves as a standard regularization for neural networks. Despite its popularity, it essentially regularizes one dimension of the individual neuron, which is not strong enough to control the capacity of highly over-parameterized neural networks. Motivated by this, hyperspherical uniformity is proposed as a novel family of relational regularizations that impact the interaction among neurons. We consider several geometrically distinct ways to achieve hyperspherical uniformity. The effectiveness of hyperspherical uniformity is justified by theoretical insights and empirical evaluations.},

The theory behind such empirical observations, however, is still largely unknown. This paper studies this fundamental problem through investigating the nonconvex rectangular matrix factorization problem, which has infinitely many global minima due to rotation and scaling invariance. Hence, gradient descent (GD) can converge to any optimum, depending on the initialization. In contrast, we show that a perturbed form of GD with an arbitrary initialization converges to a global optimum that is uniquely determined by the injected noise. Our result implies that the noise imposes implicit bias towards certain optima. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theory.},

 abstract = { We consider bandit optimization of a smooth reward function, where the goal is cumulative regret minimization. This problem has been studied for $\alpha$-Holder continuous (including Lipschitz) functions with $0<\alpha\leq 1$. Our main result is in generalization of the reward function to Holder space with exponent $\alpha>1$ to bridge the gap between Lipschitz bandits and infinitely-differentiable models such as linear bandits. For Holder continuous functions, approaches based on random sampling in bins of a discretized domain suffices as optimal. In contrast, we propose a class of two-layer algorithms that deploy misspecified linear/polynomial bandit algorithms in bins. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can exploit higher-order smoothness of the function by deriving a regret upper bound of $\tilde{O}(T^\frac{d+\alpha}{d+2\alpha})$ for when $\alpha>1$, which matches existing lower bound. We also study adaptation to unknown function smoothness over a continuous scale of Holder spaces indexed by $\alpha$, with a bandit model selection approach applied with our proposed two-layer algorithms. We show that it achieves regret rate that matches the existing lower bound for adaptation within the $\alpha\leq 1$ subset. },

It has recently emerged as one of the leading learning paradigms in the absence of labels across many different domains (e.g. brain imaging, text, images). However, theoretical understanding of many aspects of training, both statistical and algorithmic, remain fairly elusive. 
In this work, we study the setting of time series -- more precisely, when we get data from a strong-mixing continuous-time stochastic process. We show that a properly constructed contrastive learning task can be used to estimate the transition kernel for small-to-mid-range intervals in the diffusion case. Moreover, we give sample complexity bounds for solving this task and quantitatively characterize what the value of the contrastive loss implies for distributional closeness of the learned kernel. As a byproduct, we illuminate the appropriate settings for the contrastive distribution, as well as other hyperparameters in this setup.},

Although computing the Polyak step-size requires knowledge of the optimal function values, this information is readily available for typical modern machine learning applications. Consequently, the proposed stochastic Polyak step-size (SPS) is an attractive choice for setting the learning rate for stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for SGD equipped with SPS in different settings, including strongly convex, convex and non-convex functions. Furthermore, our analysis results in novel convergence guarantees for SGD with a constant step-size. We show that SPS is particularly effective when training over-parameterized models capable of interpolating the training data. In this setting, we prove that SPS enables SGD to converge to the true solution at a fast rate without requiring the knowledge of any problem-dependent constants or additional computational overhead. We experimentally validate our theoretical results via extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. We demonstrate the strong performance of SGD with SPS compared to state-of-the-art optimization methods when training over-parameterized models.},

 abstract = {Efficient modeling of relational data arising in physical, social, and information sciences is challenging due to complicated dependencies within the data. In this work, we build off of semi-implicit graph variational auto-encoders to capture higher-order statistics in a low-dimensional graph latent representation. We incorporate hyperbolic geometry in the latent space through a Poincare embedding to efficiently represent graphs exhibiting hierarchical structure. To address the naive posterior latent distribution assumptions in classical variational inference, we use semi-implicit hierarchical variational Bayes to implicitly capture posteriors of given graph data, which may exhibit heavy tails, multiple modes, skewness, and highly correlated latent structures. We show that the existing semi-implicit variational inference objective provably reduces information in the observed graph. Based on this observation, we estimate and add an additional mutual information term to the semi-implicit variational inference learning objective to capture rich correlations arising between the input and latent spaces. We show that the inclusion of this regularization term in conjunction with the Poincare embedding boosts the quality of learned high-level representations and enables more flexible and faithful graphical modeling. We experimentally demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing graph variational auto-encoders both in Euclidean and in hyperbolic spaces for edge link prediction and node classification.},

 abstract = {In a low-rank linear bandit problem, the reward of an action (represented by a matrix of size $d_1 \times d_2$) is the inner product between the action and an unknown low-rank matrix $\Theta^*$. We propose an algorithm based on a novel combination of online-to-confidence-set conversion~\citep{abbasi2012online} and the exponentially weighted average forecaster constructed by a covering of low-rank matrices. In $T$ rounds, our algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/2}\sqrt{rT})$ regret that improves upon the standard linear bandit regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(d_1d_2\sqrt{T})$ when the rank of $\Theta^*$: $r \ll \min\{d_1,d_2\}$. We also extend our algorithmic approach to the generalized linear setting to get an algorithm which enjoys a similar bound under regularity conditions on the link function. To get around the computational intractability of covering based approaches, we propose an efficient algorithm by extending the Explore-Subspace-Then-Refine algorithm of~\citet{jun2019bilinear}. Our efficient algorithm achieves $\widetilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/2}\sqrt{rT})$ regret under a mild condition on the action set $\mathcal{X}$ and the $r$-th singular value of $\Theta^*$. Our upper bounds match the conjectured lower bound of \cite{jun2019bilinear} for a subclass of low-rank linear bandit problems. Further, we show that existing lower bounds for the sparse linear bandit problem strongly suggest that our regret bounds are unimprovable. To complement our theoretical contributions, we also conduct experiments to demonstrate that our algorithm can greatly outperform the performance of the standard linear bandit approach when $\Theta^*$ is low-rank.},

 abstract = {Estimating individual treatment effects from data of randomized experiments is a critical task in causal inference. The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is usually made in causal inference. However, interference can introduce bias when the assigned treatment on one unit affects the potential outcomes of the neighboring units. This interference phenomenon is known as spillover effect in economics or peer effect in social science. Usually, in randomized experiments or observational studies with interconnected units, one can only observe treatment responses under interference. Hence, how to estimate the superimposed causal effect and recover the individual treatment effect in the presence of interference becomes a challenging task in causal inference. In this work, we study causal effect estimation under general network interference using GNNs, which are powerful tools for capturing the dependency in the graph. After deriving causal effect estimators, we further study intervention policy improvement on the graph under capacity constraint. We give policy regret bounds under network interference and treatment capacity constraint. Furthermore, a heuristic graph structure-dependent error bound for GNN-based causal estimators is provided.},

 abstract = { Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental task often used to discover meaningful structures in data. Due to the combinatorial number of possible hierarchical clusterings, approximate algorithms are typically used for inference. In contrast to existing methods, we present novel dynamic-programming algorithms for exact inference in hierarchical clustering based on a novel trellis data structure, and we prove that we can exactly compute the partition function, maximum likelihood hierarchy, and marginal probabilities of sub-hierarchies and clusters. Our algorithms scale in time and space proportional to the powerset of N elements, which is super-exponentially more efficient than explicitly considering each of the (2N â 3)!! possible hierarchies. Also, for larger datasets where our exact algorithms become infeasible, we introduce an approximate algorithm based on a sparse trellis that out- performs greedy and beam search baselines. },

We study the inductive biases of linearizations of neural networks, which we show to be surprisingly good summaries of the full network functions. Inspired by this finding, we propose a technique for embedding these inductive biases into Gaussian processes through a kernel designed from the Jacobian of the network. In this setting, domain adaptation takes the form of interpretable posterior inference, with accompanying uncertainty estimation. This inference is analytic and free of local optima issues found in standard techniques such as fine-tuning neural network weights to a new task. We develop significant computational speed-ups based on matrix multiplies, including a novel implementation for scalable Fisher vector products. Our experiments on both image classification and regression demonstrate the promise and convenience of this framework for transfer learning, compared to neural network fine-tuning.

The naive approach is to take the empirical mean of each data set individually, whereas the proposed method exploits similarities between tasks, without any related information being known in advance. First, for each data set, similar or neighboring means are determined from the data by multiple testing. Then each naive estimator is shrunk towards the local average of its neighbors. We prove theoretically that this approach provides a reduction in mean squared error. This improvement can be significant when the dimension of the input space is large, demonstrating a "blessing of dimensionality" phenomenon. An application of this approach is the estimation of multiple kernel mean embeddings, which plays an important role in many modern applications. The theoretical results are verified on artificial and real world data.},

Inspired by the growing body of work on Normalizing Flows, we enlarge this class of priors through a parametric invertible transformation that can be made input-dependent. Doing so also allows us to encode interpretable prior knowledge (e.g., boundedness constraints). We derive a variational approximation to the resulting Bayesian inference problem, which is as fast as stochastic variational GP regression (Hensman et al., 2013; Dezfouli and Bonilla,2015). This makes the model a computationally efficient alternative to other hierarchical extensions of GP priors (Lazaro-Gredilla,2012; Damianou and Lawrence, 2013). The resulting algorithm's computational and inferential performance is excellent, and we demonstrate this on a range of data sets. For example, even with only 5 inducing points and an input-dependent flow, our method is consistently competitive with a standard sparse GP fitted using 100 inducing points.},

In contrast, using an aggregation-based (improper) learner, one can obtain regret $d \log n$ for any underlying generating distribution, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter; we exhibit instances in which this is unimprovable even over the family of all learners that may play distributions in the convex hull of the parametric family. These results suggest that simple strategies for aggregating multiple learners together should be more robust, and several experiments conform to this hypothesis.},

Online submodular optimization is a generic framework for sequential decision making used to select subsets. Existing algorithms for online submodular optimization have been shown to achieve small (static) regret, which means that the algorithmâs performance is comparable to the performance of a fixed optimal action. Such algorithms, however, may perform poorly in an environment that changes over time. To overcome this problem, we apply a tracking-regret-analysis framework to online submodular optimization, one by which output is assessed through comparison with time-varying optimal subsets. We propose algorithms for submodular minimization, monotone submodular maximization under a size constraint, and unconstrained submodular maximization, and we show tracking regret bounds. In addition, we show that our tracking regret bound for submodular minimization is nearly tight. },

However, determining how much to expand the model is left to the practitioner, and often a constant schedule is chosen for simplicity, regardless of how complex the incoming task is. Instead, we propose a principled Bayesian nonparametric approach based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior, letting the data determine how much to expand the model complexity. We pair this with a factorization of the neural network's weight matrices. Such an approach allows the number of factors of each weight matrix to scale with the complexity of the task, while the IBP prior encourages sparse weight factor selection and factor reuse, promoting positive knowledge transfer between tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of continual learning benchmarks and analyze how weight factors are allocated and reused throughout the training.},

While immense interests were in either crafting adversarial attacks as a way to measure the robustness of neural networks or devising worst-case analytical robustness verification with guarantees, few methods could enjoy both scalability and robustness guarantees at the same time. As an alternative to these attempts, randomized smoothing adopts a different prediction rule that enables statistical robustness arguments which easily scale to large networks. However, in this paper, we point out the side effects of current randomized smoothing workflows. Specifically, we articulate and prove two major points: 1) the decision boundaries of smoothed classifiers will shrink, resulting in disparity in class-wise accuracy; 2) applying noise augmentation in the training process does not necessarily resolve the shrinking issue due to the inconsistent learning objectives.},

In light of these results, we propose a non-volume preserving transition function that conserves the Hamiltonian better than the baseline leapfrog mechanism, on piecewise-continuous distributions. The resulting samplers do not require any assumptions on the geometry of the discontinuity boundaries, and our experimental results show a significant improvement upon traditional HMC and NUTS. },

Hierarchies, by definition, fail to capture different flat partitions that are not subsumed in one another. In this paper, we advocate for an alternative structure for representing multiple clusterings, a directed acyclic graph (DAG). By allowing nodes to have multiple parents, DAG structures are not only more flexible than trees, but also allow for points to be members of multiple clusters. We describe a scalable algorithm, Llama, which simply merges nearest neighbor substructures to form a DAG structure. Llama discovers structures that are more accurate than state-of-the-art tree-based techniques while remaining scalable to large-scale clustering benchmarks. Additionally, we support the proposed algorithm with theoretical guarantees on separated data, including types of data that cannot be correctly clustered by tree-based algorithms. },

 abstract = {Abstract We consider the problem of estimating a signal from measurements obtained via a generalized linear model. We focus on estimators based on approximate message passing (AMP), a family of iterative algorithms with many appealing features: the performance of AMP in the high-dimensional limit can be succinctly characterized under suitable model assumptions; AMP can also be tailored to the empirical distribution of the signal entries, and for a wide class of estimation problems, AMP is conjectured to be optimal among all polynomial-time algorithms. However, a major issue of AMP is that in many models (such as phase retrieval), it requires an initialization correlated with the ground-truth signal and independent from the measurement matrix. Assuming that such an initialization is available is typically not realistic. In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing an AMP algorithm initialized with a spectral estimator. With such an initialization, the standard AMP analysis fails since the spectral estimator depends in a complicated way on the design matrix. Our main contribution is a rigorous characterization of the performance of AMP with spectral initialization in the high-dimensional limit. The key technical idea is to define and analyze a two-phase artificial AMP algorithm that first produces the spectral estimator, and then closely approximates the iterates of the true AMP. We also provide numerical results that demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach.},

However, the innovation (or error), which plays a key role by driving the dynamics, is almost always assumed to be additive. Additivity greatly limits the generality of the model, hindering analysis of general NVAR processes which have nonlinear interactions between the innovations. Here, we propose a new general framework called independent innovation analysis (IIA), which estimates the innovations from completely general NVAR. We assume mutual independence of the innovations as well as their modulation by an auxiliary variable (which is often taken as the time index and simply interpreted as nonstationarity). We show that IIA guarantees the identifiability of the innovations with arbitrary nonlinearities, up to a permutation and component-wise invertible nonlinearities. We also propose three estimation frameworks depending on the type of the auxiliary variable. We thus provide the first rigorous identifiability result for general NVAR, as well as very general tools for learning such models.},

 abstract = {Perhaps surprisingly, recent studies have shown probabilistic model likelihoods have poor specificity for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and often assign higher likelihoods to OOD data than in-distribution data. To ameliorate this issue we propose DoSE, the density of states estimator. Drawing on the statistical physics notion of ``density of states,'' the DoSE decision rule avoids direct comparison of model probabilities, and instead utilizes the ``probability of the model probability,'' or indeed the frequency of any reasonable statistic. The frequency is calculated using nonparametric density estimators (e.g., KDE and one-class SVM) which measure the typicality of various model statistics given the training data and from which we can flag test points with low typicality as anomalous. Unlike many other methods, DoSE requires neither labeled data nor OOD examples. DoSE is modular and can be trivially applied to any existing, trained model. We demonstrate DoSE's state-of-the-art performance against other unsupervised OOD detectors on previously established ``hard'' benchmarks.},

Generally approximate posteriors learned by ADVI are forced to be unimodal in order to facilitate use of the reparameterization trick. In this paper, we show how stratified sampling may be used to enable mixture distributions as the approximate posterior, and derive a new lower bound on the evidence analogous to the importance weighted autoencoder (IWAE). We show that this is a tighter bound than both IWAE and the traditional ELBO, both of which are special instances of this bound. We verify empirically that the traditional ELBO objective disfavors the presence of multimodal posterior distributions and may therefore not be able to fully capture structure in the latent space. Our experiments show that using the SIWAE objective allows the encoder to learn more complex distributions which regularly contain multimodality, resulting in higher accuracy and better calibration in the presence of incomplete, limited, or corrupted data.},

We then derive an explicit condition which ensures that gradient descent on the parameter space of the generator in gradient regularized $\mathrm{MMD}$ GAN is globally convergent to the target distribution. Under this condition, we give non asymptotic convergence results of gradient descent in MMD GAN. Another contribution of this paper is the introduction of a dynamic formulation of a regularization of $\mathrm{MMD}$ and demonstrating that the parametric kernelized descent for $\mathrm{MMD}$ is the gradient flow of this functional with respect to the new Riemannian structure. Our obtained theoretical result allows ones to treat gradient flows for quite general functionals and thus has potential applications to other types of variational inferences on a statistical manifold beyond GANs. Finally, numerical experiments suggest that our parametric kernelized gradient flow stabilizes GAN training and guarantees convergence.},

For this reason, we propose predictive complexity priors: a functional prior that is defined by comparing the model's predictions to those of a reference model.

 abstract = {Selective Inference (SI) has been actively studied in the past few years for conducting inference on the features of linear models that are adaptively selected by feature selection methods such as Lasso. The basic idea of SI is to make inference conditional on the selection event. Unfortunately, the main limitation of the original SI approach for Lasso is that the inference is conducted not only conditional on the selected features but also on their signs -- this leads to loss of power because of over-conditioning. Although this limitation can be circumvented by considering the union of such selection events for all possible combinations of signs, this is only feasible when the number of selected features is sufficiently small. To address this computational bottleneck, we propose a parametric programming-based method that can conduct SI without conditioning on signs even when we have thousands of active features. The main idea is to compute the continuum path of Lasso solutions in the direction of a test statistic, and identify the subset of the data space corresponding to the feature selection event by following the solution path. The proposed parametric programming-based method not only avoids the aforementioned computational bottleneck but also improves the performance and practicality of SI for Lasso in various respects. We conduct several experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.},

For our scheme, we prove a \textit{tight} and novel non-trivial convergence analysis for strongly convex problems for {\em heterogeneous} data which does not use the bounded gradient assumption as seen in many existing publications. The tightness is a consequence of our proofs for lower and upper bounds of the convergence rate, which show a constant factor difference.

 abstract = { We study the computational complexity of two hard problems on determinantal point processes (DPPs). One is maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, i.e., to find a principal submatrix having the maximum determinant. The other is probabilistic inference on exponentiated DPPs (E-DPPs), which can sharpen or weaken the diversity preference of DPPs with an exponent parameter $p$. We prove the following complexity-theoretic hardness results that explain the difficulty in approximating unconstrained MAP inference and the normalizing constant for E-DPPs. (1) Unconstrained MAP inference for an $n \times n$ matrix is NP-hard to approximate within a $2^{\beta n}$-factor, where $\beta = 10^{-10^{13}}$. This result improves upon a $(9/8-\epsilon)$-factor inapproximability given by Kulesza and Taskar (2012). (2) The normalizing constant for E-DPPs of any (fixed) constant exponent $p \geq \beta^{-1} = 10^{10^{13}}$ is NP-hard to approximate within a $2^{\beta pn}$-factor. This gives a(nother) negative answer to open questions posed by Kulesza and Taskar (2012); Ohsaka and Matsuoka (2020). },

 abstract = {Motivated by the necessity for parameter efficiency in distributed machine learning and AI-enabled edge devices, we provide a general and easy to implement method for significantly reducing the number of parameters of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), during both the training and inference phases. We introduce a simple auxiliary neural network which can generate the convolutional filters of any CNN architecture from a low dimensional latent space. This auxiliary neural network, which we call "Convolutional Slice Generator" (CSG), is unique to the network and provides the association between its convolutional layers. During the training of the CNN, instead of training the filters of the convolutional layers, only the parameters of the CSG and their corresponding "code vectors" are trained. This results in a significant reduction of the number of parameters due to the fact that the CNN can be fully represented using only the parameters of the CSG, the code vectors, the fully connected layers, and the architecture of the CNN. We evaluate our approach by applying it to ResNet and DenseNet models when trained on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. While reducing the number of parameters by $\approx 2 \times$ on average, the accuracies of these networks remain within 1$\%$ of their original counterparts and in some cases there is an increase in the accuracy.},

Self-training algorithms generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled examples and progressively refine these pseudo-labels which hopefully coincides with the actual labels. This work provides theoretical insights into self-training algorithms with a focus on linear classifiers. First, we provide a sample complexity analysis for Gaussian mixture models with two components. This is established by sharp non-asymptotic characterization of the self-training iterations which captures the evolution of the model accuracy in terms of a fixed-point iteration. Our analysis reveals the provable benefits of rejecting samples with low confidence and demonstrates how self-training iterations can gracefully improve the model accuracy. Secondly, we study a generalized GMM where the component means follow a distribution. We demonstrate that ridge regularization and class margin (i.e. separation between the component means) is crucial for the success and lack of regularization may prevent self-training from identifying the core features in the data. },

 abstract = {In several applications of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, the traditional objective of maximizing the expected sum of rewards obtained can be inappropriate. Motivated by the problem of optimizing job assignments to train novice workers of unknown quality in labor platforms, we consider a new objective in the classical setup. Instead of maximizing the expected total reward from $T$ pulls, we consider the vector of cumulative rewards earned from the $K$ arms at the end of $T$ pulls, and aim to maximize the expected value of the highest cumulative reward across the $K$ arms. This corresponds to the objective of training a single, highly skilled worker using a limited supply of training jobs. For this new objective, we show that any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic regret of $\Omega(\log T)$ (with a higher instance-dependent constant compared to the traditional objective) and an instance-independent regret of $\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. We then design an explore-then-commit policy, featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors). Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this policy compared to several natural alternatives in practical parameter regimes.},

Both heuristic search and Q-learning approaches to solving these puzzles can be reduced to learning a heuristic/value function to decide what puzzle move to make at each step. We propose learning a value function using the irreducible representations basis (which we will also call the Fourier basis) of the puzzleâs underlying group. Classical Fourier analysis on real valued functions tells us we can approximate smooth functions with low frequency basis functions.

However, unlike traditional computational paradigm, most neural networks do not have access to a memory, which might be hampering its ability to scale to large data structures such as graphs, lookup-tables, databases. We propose a neural architecture where sketch based memory is integrated into a neural network in a uniform manner at every layer. This architecture supplements a neural layer by information accessed from the memory before feeding it to the next layer, thereby significantly expanding the capacity of the network to solve larger problem instances. We show theoretically that problems involving key-value lookup that are traditionally stored in standard databases can now be solved using neural networks augmented by our memory architecture. We also show that our memory layer can be viewed as a kernel function. We show benefits on diverse problems such as long tail image classification, language model, large graph multi hop traversal, etc. arguing that they are all build upon the classical key-value lookup problem (or the variant where the keys may be fuzzy). },

This type of network units result in sparse representations from each model layer, as the units are organized in blocks where only one unit generates a non-zero output. The main operating principle of the introduced units lies on stochastic arguments, as the network performs posterior sampling over competing units to select the winner. We combine these LWTA arguments with tools from the field of Bayesian non-parametrics, specifically the stick-breaking construction of the Indian Buffet Process, to allow for inferring the sub-part of each layer that is essential for modeling the data at hand. Then, inference is performed by means of stochastic variational Bayes. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation of our model using benchmark datasets. As we show, our method achieves high robustness to adversarial perturbations, with state-of-the-art performance in powerful adversarial attack schemes.},

The standard RD estimand becomes difficult to interpret due to the existence of some indirect effect, i.e. the effect due to self selection. We show that the direct causal effect of interest can still be recovered under a class of estimands. Specifically, we consider a class of weighted average treatment effects tailored for potentially different target populations. We show that a special case of our estimands can recover the average treatment effect under the conditional independence assumption per Angrist and Rokkanen (2015), and another example is the estimand recently proposed in Fr\olich and Huber (2018). We propose a set of estimators through a weighted local linear regression framework and prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimators. Our approach can be further extended to the fuzzy RD case. In simulation exercises, we compare the performance of our estimator with the standard RD estimator. Finally, we apply our method to two empirical data sets: the U.S. House elections data in Lee (2008) and a novel data set from Microsoft Bing on Generalized Second Price (GSP) auction.},

 abstract = {Transformation-based methods have been an attractive approach in non-parametric inference for problems such as unconditional and conditional density estimation due to their unique hierarchical structure that models the data as flexible transformation of a set of common latent variables. More recently, transformation-based models have been used in variational inference (VI) to construct flexible implicit families of variational distributions. However, their use in both non-parametric inference and variational inference lacks theoretical justification. We provide theoretical justification for the use of non-linear latent variable models (NL-LVMs) in non-parametric inference by showing that the support of the transformation induced prior in the space of densities is sufficiently large in the $L_1$ sense. We also show that, when a Gaussian process (GP) prior is placed on the transformation function, the posterior concentrates at the optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor. Adopting the flexibility demonstrated in the non-parametric setting, we use the NL-LVM to construct an implicit family of variational distributions, deemed GP-IVI. We delineate sufficient conditions under which GP-IVI achieves optimal risk bounds and approximates the true posterior in the sense of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on providing theoretical guarantees for implicit variational inference.},

We then propose some sufficient conditions under which the increment gradient methods with gradient clipping can be shown to be convergent under the more general relaxed smoothness assumption. We also empirically observe that the angles between gradients of component functions and the full gradient generally decrease as the batchsize increases, which may help to explain why larger batchsizes generally lead to faster convergence in training deep neural networks with gradient clipping. },

In this work, we conduct a thorough investigation of the memory mechanism of TP recurrent models. Theoretically, we prove that a large degree p is an essential condition to achieve the long memory effect, yet it would lead to unstable dynamical behaviors. Empirically, we tackle this issue by extending the degree p from discrete to a differentiable domain, such that it is efficiently learnable from a variety of datasets. Taken together, the new model is expected to benefit from the long memory effect in a stable manner. We experimentally show that the proposed model achieves competitive performance compared to various advanced RNNs in both the single-cell and seq2seq architectures.},

Our algorithm is suitable to maximize a non-monotone submodular function under a p-system side constraint, and it achieves a (p + O(sqrt(p)))-approximation for this problem, after only poly-logarithmic adaptive rounds and polynomial queries to the valuation oracle function. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a (p + O(1))-approximation when the given side constraint is a p-extendable system. This algorithm yields an exponential speed-up, with respect to the adaptivity, over any other known constant-factor approximation algorithm for this problem. It also competes with previous known results in terms of the query complexity. We perform various experiments on various real-world applications. We find that, in comparison with commonly used heuristics, our algorithm performs better on these instances. },

 abstract = {Probabilistic programming systems generally compute with probability density functions, leaving the base measure of each such function implicit. This mostly works, but creates problems when densities with respect to different base measures are accidentally combined or compared. Mistakes also happen when computing volume corrections for continuous changes of variables, which in general depend on the support measure. We motivate and clarify the problem in the context of a composable library of probability distributions and bijective transformations. We solve the problem by standardizing on Hausdorff measure as a base, and deriving formulas for comparing and combining mixed-dimension densities, as well as updating densities with respect to Hausdorff measure under diffeomorphic transformations. We also propose a software architecture that implements these formulas efficiently in the common case. We hope that by adopting our solution, probabilistic programming systems can become more robust and general, and make a broader class of models accessible to practitioners.},

While previous work highlighted the implicit regularization of such algorithms, we consider an explicit regularization framework as a minimum Bregman divergence convex feasibility problem. Using convex duality, we propose randomized Dykstra-style algorithms based on randomized dual coordinate ascent. For non-accelerated coordinate descent, we obtain an algorithm which bears strong similarities with (non-averaged) stochastic mirror descent on specific functions, as it is is equivalent for quadratic objectives, and equivalent in the early iterations for more general objectives. It comes with the benefit of an explicit convergence theorem to a minimum norm solution. For accelerated coordinate descent, we obtain a new algorithm that has better convergence properties than existing stochastic gradient methods in the interpolating regime. This leads to accelerated versions of the perceptron for generic $\ell_p$-norm regularizers, which we illustrate in experiments.},

A common approach to analyse high-dimensional data that contains missing values is to learn a low-dimensional representation using variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, standard VAEs assume that the learnt representations are i.i.d., and fail to capture the correlations between the data samples. We propose the Longitudinal VAE (L-VAE), that uses a multi-output additive Gaussian process (GP) prior to extend the VAE's capability to learn structured low-dimensional representations imposed by auxiliary covariate information, and derive a new KL divergence upper bound for such GPs. Our approach can simultaneously accommodate both time-varying shared and random effects, produce structured low-dimensional representations, disentangle effects of individual covariates or their interactions, and achieve highly accurate predictive performance. We compare our model against previous methods on synthetic as well as clinical datasets, and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance in data imputation, reconstruction, and long-term prediction tasks.},

Despite its success in several deep learning applications, the study of distillation is mostly confined to classification settings. In particular, the use of distillation in top-k ranking settings, where the goal is to rank k most relevant items correctly, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we study such ranking problems through the lens of distillation. We present a distillation framework for top-k ranking and draw connections with the existing ranking methods. The core idea of this framework is to preserve the ranking at the top by matching the order of items of student and teacher, while penalizing large scores for items ranked low by the teacher. Building on this, we develop a novel distillation approach, RankDistil, specifically catered towards ranking problems with a large number of items to rank, and establish statistical basis for the method. Finally, we conduct experiments which demonstrate that RankDistil yields benefits over commonly used baselines for ranking problems. },

Most approaches use a variation of sensitivity analysis, where individual input variables are perturbed and the downstream effects on some output metric are measured. We demonstrate that a number of critical functional properties are not revealed when only considering lower-order perturbations. Motivated by these shortcomings, we propose a general framework for decomposing the orders of influence that a collection of input variables has on an output classification. These orders are based on the cardinality of input subsets which are perturbed to yield a change in classification. This decomposition can be naturally applied to attribute which input variables rely on higher-order coordination to impact the classification decision. We demonstrate that our approach correctly identifies higher-order attribution on a number of synthetic examples. Additionally, we showcase the differences between attribution in our approach and existing approaches on benchmark networks for MNIST and ImageNet. },

By showing that this eigenvalue can control the stability of gradient descent, generalisation error bounds are proven that hold under a wider range of step sizes compared to previous work. Out of sample guarantees are then achieved by decomposing the test error into generalisation, optimisation and approximation errors, each of which can be bounded and traded off with respect to algorithmic parameters, sample size and magnitude of this eigenvalue. In the case of a two layer neural network, we demonstrate that the empirical risk can satisfy a notion of local weak convexity, specifically, the Hessian's smallest eigenvalue during training can be controlled by the normalisation of the layers, i.e., network scaling. This allows test error guarantees to then be achieved when the population risk minimiser satisfies a complexity assumption. By trading off the network complexity and scaling, insights are gained into the implicit bias of neural network scaling, which are further supported by experimental findings.},

 abstract = {We analyze the prediction error of ridge regression in an asymptotic regime where the sample size and dimension go to infinity at a proportional rate. In particular, we consider the role played by the structure of the true regression parameter. We observe that the case of a general deterministic parameter can be reduced to the case of a random parameter from a structured prior. The latter assumption is a natural adaptation of classic smoothness assumptions in nonparametric regression, which are known as source conditions in the the context of regularization theory for inverse problems. Roughly speaking, we assume the large coefficients of the parameter are in correspondence to the principal components. In this setting a precise characterisation of the test error is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression parameter structure. We illustrate this characterisation in a simplified setting to investigate the influence of the true parameter on optimal regularisation for overparameterized models. We show that interpolation (no regularisation) can be optimal even with bounded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), provided that the parameter coefficients are larger on high-variance directions of the data, corresponding to a more regular function than posited by the regularization term. This contrasts with previous work considering ridge regression with isotropic prior, in which case interpolation is only optimal in the limit of infinite SNR.},

Furthermore, we devise a computationally-efficient refinement procedure that provably reduces the localization error of preliminary estimates of the change points. We demonstrate minimax lower bounds on the localization error that nearly match the upper bound on the localization error of our methodology and show that the signal-to-noise condition we impose is essentially the weakest possible based on information-theoretic arguments.

Although a growing line of work in reinforcement learning has investigated this area of "safe exploration," most existing techniques either 1) do not guarantee safety during the actual exploration process; and/or 2) limit the problem to a priori known and/or deterministic transition dynamics with strong smoothness assumptions. Addressing this gap, we propose Analogous Safe-state Exploration (ASE), an algorithm for provably safe exploration in MDPs with unknown, stochastic dynamics. Our method exploits analogies between state-action pairs to safely learn a near-optimal policy in a PAC-MDP sense. Additionally, ASE also guides exploration towards the most task-relevant states, which empirically results in significant improvements in terms of sample efficiency, when compared to existing methods.},

 abstract = {Contextual sequential decision problems with categorical or numerical observations are ubiquitous and Generalized Linear Bandits (GLB) offer a solid theoretical framework to address them. In contrast to the case of linear bandits, existing algorithms for GLB have two drawbacks undermining their applicability. First, they rely on excessively pessimistic concentration bounds due to the non-linear nature of the model. Second, they require either non-convex projection steps or burn-in phases to enforce boundedness of the estimators. Both of these issues are worsened when considering non-stationary models, in which the GLB parameter may vary with time. In this work, we focus on self-concordant GLB (which include logistic and Poisson regression) with forgetting achieved either by the use of a sliding window or exponential weights. We propose a novel confidence-based algorithm for the maximum-likehood estimator with forgetting and analyze its perfomance in abruptly changing environments. These results as well as the accompanying numerical simulations highlight the potential of the proposed approach to address non-stationarity in GLB.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of filtering in linear state-space models (e.g., the Kalman filter setting) through the lens of regret optimization. Different assumptions on the driving disturbance and the observation noise sequences give rise to different estimators: in the stochastic setting to the celebrated Kalman filter, and in the deterministic setting of bounded energy disturbances to $H_\infty$ estimators. In this work, we formulate a novel criterion for filter design based on the concept of regret between the estimation error energy of a clairvoyant estimator that has access to all future observations (a so-called smoother) and a causal one that only has access to current and past observations. The regret-optimal estimator is chosen to minimize this worst-case difference across all bounded-energy noise sequences. The resulting estimator is adaptive in the sense that it aims to mimic the behavior of the clairvoyant estimator, irrespective of what the realization of the noise will be and thus interpolates between the stochastic and deterministic approaches. We provide a solution for the regret estimation problem at two different levels. First, we provide a solution at the operator level by reducing it to the Nehari problem. Second, for state-space models, we explicitly find the estimator that achieves the optimal regret. From a computational perspective, the regret-optimal estimator can be easily implemented by solving three Riccati equations and a single Lyapunov equation. For a state-space model of dimension $n$, the regret-optimal estimator has a state-space structure of dimension $3n$. We demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of the estimator in a variety of problems and observe that the estimator has average and worst-case performances that are simultaneously close to their optimal values. We therefore argue that regret-optimality is a viable approach to estimator design.},

 abstract = {We consider a regret minimization task under the average-reward criterion in an unknown Factored Markov Decision Process (FMDP). More specifically, we consider an FMDP where the state-action space $\mathcal X$ and the state-space $\mathcal S$ admit the respective factored forms of $\mathcal X = \otimes_{i=1}^n \mathcal X_i$ and $\mathcal S=\otimes_{i=1}^m \mathcal S_i$, and the transition and reward functions are factored over $\mathcal X$ and $\mathcal S$. Assuming known factorization structure, we introduce a novel regret minimization strategy inspired by the popular UCRL2 strategy, called DBN-UCRL, which relies on Bernstein-type confidence sets defined for individual elements of the transition function. We show that for a generic factorization structure, DBN-UCRL achieves a regret bound, whose leading term strictly improves over existing regret bounds in terms of the dependencies on the size of $\mathcal S_i$'s and the involved diameter-related terms. We further show that when the factorization structure corresponds to the Cartesian product of some base MDPs, the regret of DBN-UCRL is upper bounded by the sum of regret of the base MDPs. We demonstrate, through numerical experiments on standard environments, that DBN-UCRL enjoys substantially improved regret empirically over existing algorithms that have frequentist regret guarantees.},

 abstract = { Numerous tasks in machine learning and artificial intelligence have been modeled as submodular maximization problems. These problems usually involve sensitive data about individuals, and in addition to maximizing the utility, privacy concerns should be considered. In this paper, we study the general framework of non-negative monotone submodular maximization subject to matroid or knapsack constraints in both offline and online settings. For the offline setting, we propose a differentially private $(1-\frac{\kappa}{e})$-approximation algorithm, where $\kappa\in[0,1]$ is the total curvature of the submodular set function, which improves upon prior works in terms of approximation guarantee and query complexity under the same privacy budget. In the online setting, we propose the first differentially private algorithm, and we specify the conditions under which the regret bound scales as $Ã(\sqrt{T})$, i.e., privacy could be ensured while maintaining the same regret bound as the optimal regret guarantee in the non-private setting. },

At the end of the phase, agents broadcast in a decentralized fashion, their estimated preferred arms through {\em pure exploitation}. We prove both, a new regret lower bound for the decentralized serial dictatorship model, and that UCB-D3 is order optimal.},

 abstract = { Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) provides a promising solution to many real-world problems, where labels are only available at the bag level but missing for instances due to a high labeling cost. As a powerful Bayesian non-parametric model, Gaussian Processes (GP) have been extended from classical supervised learning to MIL settings, aiming to identify the most likely positive (or least negative) instance from a positive (or negative) bag using only the bag-level labels. However, solely focusing on a single instance in a bag makes the model less robust to outliers or multi-modal scenarios, where a single bag contains a diverse set of positive instances. We propose a general GP mixture framework that simultaneously considers multiple instances through a latent mixture model. By adding a top-k constraint, the framework is equivalent to choosing the top-k most positive instances, making it more robust to outliers and multimodal scenarios. We further introduce a Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) constraint that removes the limitation of specifying a fix k value. To ensure the prediction power over high-dimensional data (e.g., videos and images) that are common in MIL, we augment the GP kernel with fixed basis functions by using a deep neural network to learn adaptive basis functions so that the covariance structure of high-dimensional data can be accurately captured. Experiments are conducted on highly challenging real-world video anomaly detection tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. },

Another point of view is when the goal is to partition equitably goods between agents according to their heterogeneous preferences. Here we aim to maximize the utility of the least advantaged agent. This is a fair division problem. Like Optimal Transport, the problem can be cast as a linear optimization problem. When there is only one agent, we recover the Optimal Transport problem. When two agents are considered, we are able to recover Integral Probability Metrics defined by $α$-Hölder functions, which include the widely-known Dudley metric. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a link is given between the Dudley metric and Optimal Transport.

Existing methods for generating interpretable CEs rely on auxiliary generative models, which may not be suitable for complex datasets, and incur engineering overhead. We introduce a simple and fast method for generating interpretable CEs in a white-box setting without an auxiliary model, by using the predictive uncertainty of the classifier. Our experiments show that our proposed algorithm generates more interpretable CEs, according to IM1 scores, than existing methods. Additionally, our approach allows us to estimate the uncertainty of a CE, which may be important in safety-critical applications, such as those in the medical domain.},

This enables lightweight iterators that can jump directly from one sampled position to the next. Previously, sequential methods focused on drawing from the distribution of gap sizes, which requires intricate algorithms that are difficult to validate and can be slow in the worst-case. This can be avoided by a new method, the Hidden Shuffle. The name mirrors the fact that although the algorithm does not resemble shuffling, its correctness can be proven by conceptualising the sampling process as a random shuffle. The Hidden Shuffle algorithm stores just a handful of values, can be implemented in few lines of code, offers strong worst-case guarantees and is shown to be faster than state-of-the-art methods while using comparably few random variates.},

 abstract = { We consider the problem of Bayesian Optimization (BO) in which the goal is to design an adaptive querying strategy to optimize a function $f:[0,1]^d\mapsto \reals$. The function is assumed to be drawn from a Gaussian Process, and can only be accessed through noisy oracle queries. The most commonly used oracle in BO literature is the noisy Zeroth-Order-OracleÂ (ZOO) which returns noise-corrupted function value $y = f(x) + \eta$ at any point $x \in \domain$ queried by the agent. A less studied oracle in BO is the First-Order-OracleÂ (FOO) which also returns noisy gradient value at the queried point. In this paper we consider the fundamental question of quantifying the possible improvement in regret that can be achieved under FOO access as compared to the case in which only ZOO access is available. Under some regularity assumptions on $K$, we first show that the expected cumulative regret with ZOO of any algorithm must satisfy a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^d n})$, where $n$ is the query budget. This lower bound captures the appropriate scaling of the regret on both dimension $d$ and budget $n$, and relies on a novel reduction from BO to a multi-armed banditÂ (MAB) problem. We then propose a two-phase algorithm which, with some additional prior knowledge, achieves a vastly improved $\mc{O}\lp d (\log n)^2 \rp$ regret when given access to a FOO. Together, these two results highlight the significant value of incorporating gradient information in BO algorithms. },

The MM constraints ensure small "effective size" of the model, which allows MM-SGP to provide good predictive performance by using limited "active" data samples, a critical property for AL. Furthermore, as a Gaussian process model, MM-SGP will output both the predicted class distribution and the predictive variance, both of which are essential for defining a sampling function effective to improve the decision boundaries of a large number of classes simultaneously. Finally, the sparse nature of MM-SGP ensures that it can be efficiently trained by solving a low-rank convex dual problem.

 abstract = { In distributed optimization, parameter updates from the gradient computing node devices have to be aggregated in every iteration on the orchestrating server. When these updates are sent over an arbitrary commodity network, bandwidth and latency can be limiting factors. We propose a communication framework where nodes may skip unnecessary uploads. Every node locally accumulates an error vector in memory and self-triggers the upload of the memory contents to the parameter server using a significance filter. The server then uses a history of the nodesâ gradients to update the parameter. We characterize the convergence rate of our algorithm in smooth settings (strongly-convex, convex, and non-convex) and show that it enjoys the same convergence rate as when sending gradients every iteration, with substantially fewer uploads. Numerical experiments on real data indicate a significant reduction of used network resources (total communicated bits and latency), especially in large networks, compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results provide important practical insights for using machine learning over resource-constrained networks, including Internet-of-Things and geo-separated datasets across the globe. },

 abstract = {In the univariate setting, using the kernel spectral representation is an appealing approach for generating stationary covariance functions. However, performing the same task for multiple-output Gaussian processes is substantially more challenging. We demonstrate that current approaches to modelling cross-covariances with a spectral mixture kernel possess a critical blind spot. For a given pair of processes, the cross-covariance is not reproducible across the full range of permitted correlations, aside from the special case where their spectral densities are of identical shape. We present a solution to this issue by replacing the conventional Gaussian components of a spectral mixture with block components of finite bandwidth (i.e. rectangular step functions). The proposed family of kernel represents the first multi-output generalisation of the spectral mixture kernel that can approximate any stationary multi-output kernel to arbitrary precision.},

In the most well-studied case, the objective function is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous and minimax rates of simple and cumulative regrets are known in both noiseless and noisy settings. This paper studies continuum-armed bandits under more general smoothness conditions, namely Besov smoothness conditions, on the objective function. In both noiseless and noisy conditions, we derive minimax rates under simple and cumulative regrets.

We present two applications, intelligent SMS routing problem and ad audience optimization problem faced by several businesses (especially online platforms), and show how our problem uniquely captures key features of these applications. We show that naive generalizations of existing MAB algorithms like Upper Confidence Bound and Thompson Sampling do not perform well for this problem.

We also present a simple variant of explore-then-commit and establish near-optimal regret bounds for this algorithm. Lastly, we perform extensive numerical simulations to understand the behavior of a suite of algorithms for various instances and recommend a practical guide to employ different algorithms.},

 abstract = { We revisit the well-studied problem of differentially private empirical risk minimization (ERM). We show that for unconstrained convex generalized linear models (GLMs), one can obtain an excess empirical risk of $\tilde O\left(\sqrt{\rank}/\epsilon n\right)$, where $\rank$ is the rank of the feature matrix in the GLM problem, $n$ is the number of data samples, and $\epsilon$ is the privacy parameter. This bound is attained via differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD). Furthermore, via the \emph{first lower bound for unconstrained private ERM}, we show that our upper bound is tight. In sharp contrast to the constrained ERM setting, there is no dependence on the dimensionality of the ambient model space ($p$). (Notice that $\rank\leq \min\{n, p\}$.) Besides, we obtain an analogous excess population risk bound which depends on $\rank$ instead of $p$. For the smooth non-convex GLM setting (i.e., where the objective function is non-convex but preserves the GLM structure), we further show that DP-GD attains a dimension-independent convergence of $\tilde O\left(\sqrt{\rank}/\epsilon n\right)$ to a first-order-stationary-point of the underlying objective. Finally, we show that for convex GLMs, a variant of DP-GD commonly used in practice (which involves clipping the individual gradients) also exhibits the same dimension-independent convergence to the minimum of a well-defined objective. To that end, we provide a structural lemma that characterizes the effect of clipping on the optimization profile of DP-GD. },

 abstract = {Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) is a flexible framework to handle uncertain inputs in Gaussian Processes (GPs) and incorporate GPs as components of larger graphical models. Nonetheless, the standard GPLVM variational inference approach is tractable only for a narrow family of kernel functions. The most popular implementations of GPLVM circumvent this limitation using quadrature methods, which may become a computational bottleneck even for relatively low dimensions. For instance, the widely employed Gauss-Hermite quadrature has exponential complexity on the number of dimensions. In this work, we propose using the unscented transformation instead. Overall, this method presents comparable, if not better, performance than offthe-shelf solutions to GPLVM and its computational complexity scales only linearly on dimension. In contrast to Monte Carlo methods, our approach is deterministic and works well with quasi-Newton methods, such as the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm. We illustrate the applicability of our method with experiments on dimensionality reduction and multistep-ahead prediction with uncertainty propagation.},

 abstract = { Statistical distances (SDs), which quantify the dissimilarity between probability distributions, are central to machine learning and statistics. A modern method for estimating such distances from data relies on parametrizing a variational form by a neural network (NN) and optimizing it. These estimators are abundantly used in practice, but corresponding performance guarantees are partial and call for further exploration. In particular, there seems to be a fundamental tradeoff between the two sources of error involved: approximation and estimation. While the former needs the NN class to be rich and expressive, the latter relies on controlling complexity. This paper explores this tradeoff by means of non-asymptotic error bounds, focusing on three popular choices of SDsâKullback-Leibler divergence, chi-squared divergence, and squared Hellinger distance. Our analysis relies on non-asymptotic function approximation theorems and tools from empirical process theory. Numerical results validating the theory are also provided. },

Exploiting the dual Kantorovitch formulation of Wasserstein distance, we introduce and discuss novel MoM-based robust estimators whose consistency is studied under a data contamination model and for which convergence rates are provided. These MoM estimators enable to make Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) robust to outliers, as witnessed by an empirical study on two benchmarks CIFAR10 and Fashion MNIST. Eventually, we discuss how to combine MoM with the entropy-regularized approximation of the Wasserstein distance and propose a simple MoM-based re-weighting scheme that could be used in conjunction with the Sinkhorn algorithm.},

 abstract = {As the use of machine learning in high impact domains becomes widespread, the importance of evaluating safety has increased. An important aspect of this is evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm's performance on the "worst-case" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a "debiased" estimator which maintains $\sqrt{N}$-consistency even when machine learning methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without requiring additional data collection.},

Given the covariate distribution, HRTs can explicitly control the false discovery rate (FDR). However, if this distribution is unknown and must be estimated from data, HRTs can inflate the FDR. To alleviate the inflation of FDR, we propose the contrarian randomization test (CONTRA), which is designed explicitly for scenarios where the covariate distribution must be estimated from data and may even be misspecified. Our key insight is to use an equal mixture of two "contrarian" probabilistic models in determining the importance of a covariate. One model is fit with the real data, while the other is fit using the same data, but with the covariate being tested replaced with samples from an estimate of the covariate distribution. CONTRA is flexible enough to achieve a power of 1 asymptotically, can reduce the FDR compared to state-of-the-art CVS methods when the covariate distribution is misspecified, and is computationally efficient in high dimensions and large sample sizes. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of CONTRA on numerous synthetic benchmarks, and highlight its capabilities on a genetic dataset.},

However, they introduce a huge number of random variables for neural network weights and thus severe computational and inferential challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic meta-learning method called amortized Bayesian prototype meta-learning. In contrast to previous methods, we introduce only a small number of random variables for latent class prototypes rather than a huge number for network weights; we learn to learn the posterior distributions of these latent prototypes in an amortized inference way with no need for an extra amortization network, such that we can easily approximate their posteriors conditional on few labeled samples, whenever at meta-training or meta-testing stage. The proposed method can be trained end-to-end without any pre-training. Compared with other probabilistic meta-learning methods, our proposed approach is more interpretable with much less random variables, while still be able to achieve competitive performance for few-shot image classification problems on various benchmark datasets. Its excellent robustness and predictive uncertainty are also demonstrated through ablation studies. },

Despite their popularity, a theory that explains their statistical properties in modern regimes where both the number of measurements and the number of unknown parameters is large is only recently emerging. In this paper, we characterize for the first time the fundamental limits on the statistical accuracy of convex ERM for inference in high-dimensional generalized linear models. For a stylized setting with Gaussian features and problem dimensions that grow large at a proportional rate, we start with sharp performance characterizations and then derive tight lower bounds on the estimation and prediction error that hold over a wide class of loss functions and for any value of the regularization parameter. Our precise analysis has several attributes. First, it leads to a recipe for optimally tuning the loss function and the regularization parameter. Second, it allows to precisely quantify the sub-optimality of popular heuristic choices: for instance, we show that optimally-tuned least-squares is (perhaps surprisingly) approximately optimal for standard logistic data, but the sub-optimality gap grows drastically as the signal strength increases. Third, we use the bounds to precisely assess the merits of ridge-regularization as a function of the over-parameterization ratio. Notably, our bounds are expressed in terms of the Fisher Information of random variables that are simple functions of the data distribution, thus making ties to corresponding bounds in classical statistics.},

This complexity measure is quite relevant to understand general properties of the expressivity of neural networks such as the benefit of depth over width. Nevertheless, it appears limited when it comes to comparing the expressivity of different network architectures. This lack becomes particularly prominent when considering permutation-invariant networks, due to the symmetrical redundancy among the linear regions. To tackle this, we propose a refined definition of piecewise linear function complexity: instead of counting the number of linear regions directly, we first introduce an equivalence relation among the linear functions composing a piecewise linear function and then count those linear functions relative to that equivalence relation. Our new complexity measure can clearly distinguish between the two aforementioned models, is consistent with the classical measure, and increases exponentially with depth.},

 abstract = { We investigate the misspecified linear contextual bandit (MLCB) problem, which is a generalization of the linear contextual bandit (LCB) problem. The MLCB problem is a decision-making problem in which a learner observes $d$-dimensional feature vectors, called arms, chooses an arm from $K$ arms, and then obtains a reward from the chosen arm in each round. The learner aims to maximize the sum of the rewards over $T$ rounds. In contrast to the LCB problem, the rewards in the MLCB problem may not be represented by a linear function in feature vectors; instead, it is approximated by a linear function with additive approximation parameter $\varepsilon \geq 0$. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{dT\log(K)} + \varepsilon\sqrt{d}T)$ regret, where $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ ignores polylogarithmic factors in $d$ and $T$. This is the first algorithm that guarantees a high-probability regret bound for the MLCB problem without knowledge of the approximation parameter $\varepsilon$. },

@inproceedings{pmlr-v130-tang21a,
 abstract = { There is an increasing use of algorithms to inform decisions in many settings, from student evaluations, college admissions, to credit scoring. These decisions are made by applying a decision rule to individualâs observed features. Given the impacts of these decisions on individuals, decision makers are increasingly required to be transparent on their decision making to offer the âright to explanation.â Meanwhile, being transparent also invites potential manipulations, also known as gaming, that the individuals can utilize the knowledge to strategically alter their features in order to receive a more beneficial decision. In this work, we study the problem of \emph{robust} decision-making under strategic behavior. Prior works often assume that the decision maker has full knowledge of individualsâ cost structure for manipulations. We study the robust variant that relaxes this assumption: The decision maker does not have full knowledge but knows only a subset of the individualsâ available actions and associated costs. To approach this non-quantifiable uncertainty, we define robustness based on the worst-case guarantee of a decision, over all possible actions (including actions unknown to the decision maker) individuals might take. A decision rule is called \emph{robust optimal} if its worst case performance is (weakly) better than that of all other decision rules. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a crisp characterization of the above robust optimality: For any decision rules under mild conditions that are robust optimal, there exists a linear decision rule that is equally robust optimal. Second, we explore the computational problem of searching for the robust optimal decision rule and interestingly, we demonstrate the problem is closely related to distributionally robust optimization. We believe our results promotes the use of simple linear decisions with uncertain individual manipulations. },

 abstract = {Predicting which action (treatment) will lead to a better outcome is a central task in decision support systems. To build a prediction model in real situations, learning from biased observational data is a critical issue due to the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased observational data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual machine learning have focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes on a binary action space and the difference between them, namely, the individual treatment effect. When it comes to a large action space (e.g., selecting an appropriate combination of medicines for a patient), however, the regression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no longer sufficient in practical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance. This is because the mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee the nonexistence of a single potential outcome misestimation that might mislead the whole decision. Our proposed loss minimizes a classification error of whether or not the action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible actions, which further improves the decision-making performance, as we prove. We also propose a network architecture and a regularizer that extracts a debiased representation not only from the individual feature but also from the biased action for better generalization in large action spaces. Extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method for large combinatorial action spaces.},

 abstract = {Within the machine learning community, the widely-used uniform convergence framework has been used to answer the question of how complex, over-parameterized models can generalize well to new data. This approach bounds the test error of the worst-case model one could have fit to the data, but it has fundamental limitations. Inspired by the statistical mechanics approach to learning, we formally define and develop a methodology to compute precisely the full distribution of test errors among interpolating classifiers from several model classes. We apply our method to compute this distribution for several real and synthetic datasets, with both linear and random feature classification models. We find that test errors tend to concentrate around a small typical value $\varepsilon^*$, which deviates substantially from the test error of the worst-case interpolating model on the same datasets, indicating that bad classifiers are extremely rare. We provide theoretical results in a simple setting in which we characterize the full asymptotic distribution of test errors, and we show that these indeed concentrate around a value $\varepsilon^*$, which we also identify exactly. We then formalize a more general conjecture supported by our empirical findings. Our results show that the usual style of analysis in statistical learning theory may not be fine-grained enough to capture the good generalization performance observed in practice, and that approaches based on the statistical mechanics of learning may offer a promising alternative.},

 abstract = { Efficiently finding First-order Nash Equilibria (FNE) in zero-sum games can be challenging, even in a two-player setting. This work proposes an algorithm for finding the FNEs of a two-player zero-sum game, in which the local cost functions can be non-convex, and the players only have access to local stochastic gradients. The proposed approach is based on reformulating the problem of interest as minimizing the Regularized Nikaido-Isoda (RNI) function. We show that the global minima of the RNI correspond to the set of FNEs, and that for certain classes of non-convex games the RNI minimization problem becomes convex. Moreover, we introduce a first-order (stochastic) optimization method, and establish its convergence to a neighborhood of a stationary solution of the RNI objective. The key in the analysis is to properly control the bias between the local stochastic gradient and the true one. Although the RNI function has been used in analyzing convex games, to our knowledge, this is the first time that the properties of the RNI formulation have been exploited to find FNEs for non-convex games in a stochastic setting. },

In this paper, we prove structural lemmas for both objectives allowing us to convert any HC tree to a tree with constant number of internal nodes while incurring an arbitrarily small loss in each objective. Although the best-known approximations are 0.585 and 0.667 respectively, using our lemmas we obtain approximations arbitrarily close to 1, if not all weights are small (i.e., there exist constants $ε, δ$ such that the fraction of weights smaller than $δ$, is at most $1 - ε$); such instances encompass many metric-based similarity instances, thereby improving upon prior work. Finally, we introduce Hierarchical Correlation Clustering (HCC) to handle instances that contain similarity and dissimilarity information simultaneously. For HCC, we provide an approximation of 0.4767 and for complementary similarity/dissimilarity weights (analogous to $+/-$ correlation clustering), we again present nearly-optimal approximations.},

The regret bounds often rely on the maximal information gain $\gamma_T$ between $T$ observations and the underlying GP (surrogate) model. We provide general bounds on $\gamma_T$ based on the decay rate of the eigenvalues of the GP kernel, whose specialisation for commonly used kernels, improves the existing bounds on $\gamma_T$, and consequently the regret bounds relying on $\gamma_T$ under numerous settings. For the Matern family of kernels, where the lower bounds on $\gamma_T$, and regret under the frequentist setting, are known, our results close a huge polynomial in $T$ gap between the upper and lower bounds (up to logarithmic in $T$ factors).},

We provide necessary and sufficient separability conditions under which these algorithms can consistently recover the underlying true clustering. Our analysis provides guarantees for kernel clustering approaches without structural assumptions on the form of the component distributions.

 abstract = { Probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) are effective for capturing the statistical dependencies in stochastic databases. In many domains (e.g., working with multimodal data), one faces multiple information layers that can be modeled by structurally similar PGMs. While learning the structures of PGMs in isolation is well-investigated, the algorithmic design and performance limits of learning from multiple coupled PGMs are investigated far less. This paper considers learning the structural similarities shared by a pair of Ising PGMs. The objective is learning the shared structure with no regard for the structures exclusive to either of the graphs, and significantly different from the existing approaches that focus on entire structure of the graphs. We propose an algorithm for the shared structure learning objective, evaluate its performance empirically, and compare with existing approaches on structure learning of single graphs. },

 abstract = { Deep learning approaches often require huge datasets to achieve good generalization. This complicates its use in tasks like image-based medical diagnosis, where the small training datasets are usually insufficient to learn appropriate data representations. For such sensitive tasks it is also important to provide the confidence in the predictions. Here, we propose a way to learn and use probabilistic labels to train accurate and calibrated deep networks from relatively small datasets. We observe gains of up to 22% in the accuracy of models trained with these labels, as compared with traditional approaches, in three classification tasks: diagnosis of hip dysplasia, fatty liver, and glaucoma. The outputs of models trained with probabilistic labels are calibrated, allowing the interpretation of its predictions as proper probabilities. We anticipate this approach will apply to other tasks where few training instances are available and expert knowledge can be encoded as probabilities. },

 abstract = {The theoretical analysis of deep neural networks (DNN) is arguably among the most challenging research directions in machine learning (ML) right now, as it requires from scientists to lay novel statistical learning foundations to explain their behaviour in practice. While some success has been achieved recently in this endeavour, the question on whether DNNs can be analyzed using the tools from other scientific fields outside the ML community has not received the attention it may well have deserved. In this paper, we explore the interplay between DNNs and game theory (GT), and show how one can benefit from the classic readily available results from the latter when analyzing the former. In particular, we consider the widely studied class of congestion games, and illustrate their intrinsic relatedness to both linear and non-linear DNNs and to the properties of their loss surface. Beyond retrieving the state-of-the-art results from the literature, we argue that our work provides a very promising novel tool for analyzing the DNNs and support this claim by proposing concrete open problems that can advance significantly our understanding of DNNs when solved.},

The level of delegation granted to such systems in critical applications like credit lending and medical diagnosis will heavily depend on how questions of fairness can be answered. In this paper, we study fairness for the problem of learning scoring functions from binary labeled data, a classic learning task known as bipartite ranking. We argue that the functional nature of the ROC curve, the gold standard measure of ranking accuracy in this context, leads to several ways of formulating fairness constraints. We introduce general families of fairness definitions based on the AUC and on ROC curves, and show that our ROC-based constraints can be instantiated such that classifiers obtained by thresholding the scoring function satisfy classification fairness for a desired range of thresholds. We establish generalization bounds for scoring functions learned under such constraints, design practical learning algorithms and show the relevance our approach with numerical experiments on real and synthetic data.},

While existing literature tends to focus on optimism-based algorithms--which have been shown to be suboptimal in many cases--our approach carefully plans which action to take by balancing the tradeoff between information gain and reward, overcoming the failures of optimism. In addition, we leverage tools from the theory of suprema of empirical processes to obtain regret guarantees that scale with the Gaussian width of the action set, avoiding wasteful union bounds. We provide state-of-the-art finite time regret guarantees and show that our algorithm can be applied in both the bandit and semi-bandit feedback regime. In the combinatorial semi-bandit setting, we show that our algorithm is computationally efficient and relies only on calls to a linear maximization oracle. In addition, we show that with slight modification our algorithm can be used for pure exploration, obtaining state-of-the-art pure exploration guarantees in the semi-bandit setting. Finally, we provide, to the best of our knowledge, the first example where optimism fails in the semi-bandit regime, and show that in this setting our algorithm succeeds.},

For computational efficiency, subsampling is often implemented with replacement or through Poisson subsampling. However, no rigorous investigation has been performed to study the difference between the two subsampling procedures such as their estimation efficiency and computational convenience. In the context of maximizing a general target function, this paper derives optimal subsampling probabilities for both subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. The optimal subsampling probabilities minimize variance functions of the subsampling estimators. Furthermore, they provide deep insights on the theoretical similarities and differences between subsampling with replacement and Poisson subsampling. Practically implementable algorithms are proposed based on the optimal structural results, which are evaluated by both theoretical and empirical analysis. },

 abstract = {Many existing approaches for estimating feature importance are problematic because they ignore or hide dependencies among features. A causal graph, which encodes the relationships among input variables, can aid in assigning feature importance. However, current approaches that assign credit to nodes in the causal graph fail to explain the entire graph. In light of these limitations, we propose Shapley Flow, a novel approach to interpreting machine learning models. It considers the entire causal graph, and assigns credit to \textit{edges} instead of treating nodes as the fundamental unit of credit assignment. Shapley Flow is the unique solution to a generalization of the Shapley value axioms to directed acyclic graphs. We demonstrate the benefit of using Shapley Flow to reason about the impact of a model's input on its output. In addition to maintaining insights from existing approaches, Shapley Flow extends the flat, set-based, view prevalent in game theory based explanation methods to a deeper, \textit{graph-based}, view. This graph-based view enables users to understand the flow of importance through a system, and reason about potential interventions.},

 abstract = {The key task of physical simulation is to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) on discretized domains, which is known to be costly. In particular, high-fidelity solutions are much more expensive than low-fidelity ones. To reduce the cost, we consider novel Gaussian process (GP) models that leverage simulation examples of different fidelities to predict high-dimensional PDE solution outputs. Existing GP methods are either not scalable to high-dimensional outputs or lack effective strategies to integrate multi-fidelity examples. To address these issues, we propose Multi-Fidelity High-Order Gaussian Process (MFHoGP) that can capture complex correlations both between the outputs and between the fidelities to enhance solution estimation, and scale to large numbers of outputs. Based on a novel nonlinear coregionalization model, MFHoGP propagates bases throughout fidelities to fuse information, and places a deep matrix GP prior over the basis weights to capture the (nonlinear) relationships across the fidelities. To improve inference efficiency and quality, we use bases decomposition to largely reduce the model parameters, and layer-wise matrix Gaussian posteriors to capture the posterior dependency and to simplify the computation. Our stochastic variational learning algorithm successfully handles millions of outputs without extra sparse approximations. We show the advantages of our method in several typical applications.},

We develop an upper confidence bound-based algorithm, RobustAgg$(\epsilon)$, that adaptively aggregates rewards collected by different players.

For p parameters, size of the support set k , and l samples per task, we show that T \in O (( k log(p) ) /l ) tasks are sufficient in order to recover the common support of all tasks. With the recovered support, we can greatly reduce the sample complexity for estimating the parameter of the novel task, i.e., l \in O (1) with respect to T and p . We also prove that our rates are minimax optimal. A key difference between meta-learning and the classical multi-task learning, is that meta-learning focuses only on the recovery of the parameters of the novel task, while multi-task learning estimates the parameter of all tasks, which requires l to grow with T . Instead, our efficient meta-learning estimator allows for l to be constant with respect to T (i.e., few-shot learning).},

But it is often more useful to estimate predictive correlations between the function values at different input locations. In this paper, we consider the problem of benchmarking how accurately Bayesian models can estimate predictive correlations. We first consider a downstream task which depends on posterior predictive correlations: transductive active learning (TAL). We find that TAL makes better use of models' uncertainty estimates than ordinary active learning, and recommend this as a benchmark for evaluating Bayesian models. Since TAL is too expensive and indirect to guide development of algorithms, we introduce two metrics which more directly evaluate the predictive correlations and which can be computed efficiently: meta-correlations (i.e. the correlations between the models correlation estimates and the true values), and cross-normalized likelihoods (XLL). We validate these metrics by demonstrating their consistency with TAL performance and obtain insights about the relative performance of current Bayesian neural net and Gaussian process models.},

 abstract = { In the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) scenario, the training data consists of instances grouped into bags. Bag labels indicate whether each bag contains at least one positive instance, but instance labels are not observed. Recently, Haussmann et al (CVPR 2017) tackled the MIL instance label prediction task by introducing the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Logistic (MIL-GP-Logistic) model, an adaptation of the Gaussian Process Logistic Classification model that inherits its uncertainty quantification and flexibility. Notably, they provide a fast mean-field variational inference procedure. However, due to their choice of the logistic link, they do not maximize the ELBO objective directly, but rather a lower bound on it. This approximation, as we show, hurts predictive performance. In this work, we propose the Multiple Instance Learning Gaussian Process Probit (MIL-GP-Probit) model, an adaptation of the Gaussian Process Probit Classification model to solve the MIL instance label prediction problem. Leveraging the analytical tractability of the probit link, we give a variational inference procedure based on variable augmentation that maximizes the ELBO objective directly. Applying it, we show MIL-GP-Probit is significantly more calibrated than MIL-GP-Logistic on all 20 datasets of the benchmark 20 Newsgroups dataset collection, and achieves higher AUC than MIL-GP-Logistic on an additional 51 out of 59 datasets. Furthermore, we show how the probit formulation enables principled bag label predictions and a Gibbs sampling scheme. This is the first exact posterior inference procedure for any Bayesian model for the MIL scenario. },

 abstract = { Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are powerful parametric models for nonlinear regression with uncertainty quantification. However, the approximate inference techniques for weight space priors suffer from several drawbacks. The âBayesian last layerâ (BLL) is an alternative BNN approach that learns the feature space for an exact Bayesian linear model with explicit predictive distributions. However, its predictions outside of the data distribution (OOD) are typically overconfident, as the marginal likelihood objective results in a learned feature space that overfits to the data. We overcome this weakness by introducing a functional prior on the modelâs derivatives w.r.t. the inputs. Treating these Jacobians as latent variables, we incorporate the prior into the objective to influence the smoothness and diversity of the features, which enables greater predictive uncertainty. For the BLL, the Jacobians can be computed directly using forward mode automatic differentiation, and the distribution over Jacobians may be obtained in closed-form. We demonstrate this method enhances the BLL to Gaussian process-like performance on tasks where calibrated uncertainty is critical: OOD regression, Bayesian optimization and active learning, which include high-dimensional real-world datasets. },

State-of-the-art architectures rely on coupling and autoregressive transformations to lift up invertible functions from scalars to vectors. In this work, we revisit these transformations as probabilistic graphical models, showing they reduce to Bayesian networks with a pre-defined topology and a learnable density at each node. From this new perspective, we propose the graphical normalizing flow, a new invertible transformation with either a prescribed or a learnable graphical structure. This model provides a promising way to inject domain knowledge into normalizing flows while preserving both the interpretability of Bayesian networks and the representation capacity of normalizing flows. We show that graphical conditioners discover relevant graph structure when we cannot hypothesize it. In addition, we analyze the effect of $\ell_1$-penalization on the recovered structure and on the quality of the resulting density estimation.

 abstract = {Recently there have been many research efforts in developing generative models for self-exciting point processes, partly due to their broad applicability for real-world applications. However, rarely can we quantify how well the generative model captures the nature or ground-truth since it is usually unknown. The challenge typically lies in the fact that the generative models typically provide, at most, good approximations to the ground-truth (e.g., through the rich representative power of neural networks), but they cannot be precisely the ground-truth. We thus cannot use the classic goodness-of-fit (GOF) test framework to evaluate their performance. In this paper, we develop a GOF test for generative models of self-exciting processes by making a new connection to this problem with the classical statistical theory of Quasi-maximum-likelihood estimator (QMLE). We present a non-parametric self-normalizing statistic for the GOF test: the Generalized Score (GS) statistics, and explicitly capture the model misspecification when establishing the asymptotic distribution of the GS statistic. Numerical simulation and real-data experiments validate our theory and demonstrate the proposed GS test's good performance.},

 abstract = {The Gaussian process (GP) is an attractive Bayesian model for machine learning which combines an elegant formulation with model flexibility and uncertainty quantification. Sparse Gaussian process (sGP) algorithms provide an approximate solution that mitigates the high computational complexity of GP and the variational approximation is the current best practice for such approximations. Recent theoretical work has shown that an alternative approach, direct loss minimization (DLM), which directly minimizes predictive loss, comes with strong guarantees on the expected loss of the algorithm. In this paper we explore this approach experimentally. We develop the DLM algorithm for sGP and show that with appropriate hyperparameter optimization it provides a significant improvement over the variational approach. In particular, optimizing sGP for log loss provides better calibrated predictions for regression, classification and count prediction, and optimizing sGP for square loss improves the mean square error in regression.},

 abstract = { It is important to collect credible training samples $(x,y)$ for building data-intensive learning systems (e.g., a deep learning system). Asking people to report complex distribution $p(x)$, though theoretically viable, is challenging in practice. This is primarily due to the cognitive loads required for human agents to form the report of this highly complicated information. While classical elicitation mechanisms apply to eliciting a complex and generative (and continuous) distribution $p(x)$, we are interested in eliciting samples $x_i \sim p(x)$ from agents directly. We coin the above problem sample elicitation. This paper introduces a deep learning aided method to incentivize credible sample contributions from self-interested and rational agents. We show that with an accurate estimation of a certain $f$-divergence function we can achieve approximate incentive compatibility in eliciting truthful samples. We then present an efficient estimator with theoretical guarantees via studying the variational forms of the $f$-divergence function. We also show a connection between this sample elicitation problem and $f$-GAN, and how this connection can help reconstruct an estimator of the distribution based on collected samples. Experiments on synthetic data, MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that our mechanism elicits truthful samples.

In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a Sequential Monte Carlo approach to estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, recently published by Kucharski et al. 2020.},

Sparse Markovian Gaussian processes combine the use of inducing variables with efficient Kalman filter-like recursions, resulting in algorithms whose computational and memory requirements scale linearly in the number of inducing points, whilst also enabling parallel parameter updates and stochastic optimisation. Under this paradigm, we derive a general site-based approach to approximate inference, whereby we approximate the non-Gaussian likelihood with local Gaussian terms, called sites. Our approach results in a suite of novel sparse extensions to algorithms from both the machine learning and signal processing literature, including variational inference, expectation propagation, and the classical nonlinear Kalman smoothers.

This paper introduces adaptive wavelet pooling layers, which employ fast wavelet transforms (FWT) to reduce the feature resolution. The FWT decomposes the input features into multiple scales reducing the feature dimensions by removing the fine-scale subbands. Our approach adds extra flexibility through wavelet-basis function optimization and coefficient weighting at different scales. The adaptive wavelet layers integrate directly into well-known CNNs like the LeNet, Alexnet, or Densenet architectures. Using these networks, we validate our approach and find competitive performance on the MNIST, CIFAR10, and SVHN (street view house numbers) data-sets. },

Provided knowledge of the signal sparsity $k$, we prove that a single step of HWF is able to recover the support from $k(x^*_{max})^{-2}$ (modulo logarithmic term) samples, where $x^*_{max}$ is the largest component of the signal in magnitude. This support recovery procedure can be used to initialize existing reconstruction methods and yields algorithms with total runtime proportional to the cost of reading the data and improved sample complexity, which is linear in $k$ when the signal contains at least one large component. We numerically investigate the performance of HWF at convergence and show that, while not requiring any explicit form of regularization nor knowledge of $k$, HWF adapts to the signal sparsity and reconstructs sparse signals with fewer measurements than existing gradient based methods.},

The prediction game continues in an online fashion as the sample size grows with new observations. After each prediction, the predictor incurs a binary (0-1) loss. The probability model underlying a sample is otherwise unknown except that it belongs to a known class of models. The goal is to make finitely many errors (i.e. loss of 1) with probability 1 under the generating model, no matter what it may be in the known model class. Model classes admitting predictors that make only finitely many errors are eventually almost surely (eas) predictable. When the losses incurred are observable (the supervised case), we completely characterize eas predictable classes. We provide analogous results in the unsupervised case. Our results have a natural interpretation in terms of regularization. In eas-predictable classes, we study if it is possible to have a universal stopping rule that identifies (to any given confidence) when no more errors will be made. Classes admitting such a stopping rule are eas learnable. When samples are generated iid, we provide a complete characterization of eas learnability. We also study cases when samples are not generated iid, but a full characterization remains open at this point. },

Since this approach is model-agnostic and inherently scalable we can certify arbitrary classifiers. Despite its success, recent works show that for a small class of i.i.d. distributions, the largest $l_p$ radius that can be certified using randomized smoothing decreases as $O(1/d^{1/2-1/p})$ with dimension $d$ for $p > 2$. We complete the picture and show that similar no-go results hold for the $l_2$ norm for a much more general family of distributions which are continuous and symmetric about the origin. Specifically, we calculate two different upper bounds of the $l_2$ certified radius which have a constant multiplier of order $\Theta(1/d^{1/2})$. Moreover, we extend our results to $l_p (p>2)$ certification with spherical symmetric distributions solidifying the limitations of randomized smoothing. We discuss the implications of our results for how accuracy and robustness are related, and why robust training with noise augmentation can alleviate some of the limitations in practice. We also show that on real-world data the gap between the certified radius and our upper bounds is small. },

Specifically, we seek the pseudo labels of the unlabeled data so that the model can generalize well on the labeled data, which is formulated as a nested optimization problem. We address this problem using the meta-gradient that bridges between the pseudo label and the regularization term.

Our investigation is motivated by three observed searching patterns of differentiable NAS: 1) they search by growing instead of pruning; 2) wider networks are more preferred than deeper ones; 3) no edges are selected in bi-level optimization. To anatomize these phenomena, we propose a unified view on searching algorithms of existing frameworks, transferring the global optimization to local cost minimization. Based on this reformulation, we conduct empirical and theoretical analyses, revealing implicit inductive biases in the cost's assignment mechanism and evolution dynamics that cause the observed phenomena. These biases indicate strong discrimination towards certain topologies. To this end, we pose questions that future differentiable methods for neural wiring discovery need to confront, hoping to evoke a discussion and rethinking on how much bias has been enforced implicitly in existing NAS methods.},

Surprisingly, we obtain a negative result that the classical noise-injection approach will not help improve the testing performance in the beginning stage of the large-$\omega$ regime, even in the level of the multiplicative constant of asymptotic regret. As a technical by-product, we prove that under different model assumptions, the pre-processed 1-NN proposed in \cite{xue2017achieving} will at most achieve a sub-optimal rate when the data dimension $d>4$ even if $k$ is chosen optimally in the pre-processing step.},

 abstract = {Modern machine learning and deep learning models are shown to be vulnerable when testing data are slightly perturbed. Existing theoretical studies of adversarial training algorithms mostly focus on either adversarial training losses or local convergence properties. In contrast, this paper studies the generalization performance of a generic adversarial training algorithm. Specifically, we consider linear regression models and two-layer neural networks (with lazy training) using squared loss under low-dimensional and high-dimensional regimes. In the former regime, after overcoming the non-smoothness of adversarial training, the adversarial risk of the trained models can converge to the minimal adversarial risk. In the latter regime, we discover that data interpolation prevents the adversarially robust estimator from being consistent. Therefore, inspired by successes of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we incorporate the L1 penalty in the high dimensional adversarial learning and show that it leads to consistent adversarially robust estimation. A series of numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate how the smoothness and L1 penalization help improve the adversarial robustness of DNN models.},

 abstract = {Adversarially robust learning aims to design algorithms that are robust to small adversarial perturbations on input variables. Beyond the existing studies on the predictive performance to adversarial samples, our goal is to understand statistical properties of adversarially robust estimates and analyze adversarial risk in the setup of linear regression models. By discovering the statistical minimax rate of convergence of adversarially robust estimators, we emphasize the importance of incorporating model information, e.g., sparsity, in adversarially robust learning. Further, we reveal an explicit connection of adversarial and standard estimates, and propose a straightforward two-stage adversarial learning framework, which facilitates to utilize model structure information to improve adversarial robustness. In theory, the consistency of the adversarially robust estimator is proven and its Bahadur representation is also developed for the statistical inference purpose. The proposed estimator converges in a sharp rate under either low-dimensional or sparse scenario. Moreover, our theory confirms two phenomena in adversarially robust learning: adversarial robustness hurts generalization, and unlabeled data help improve the generalization. In the end, we conduct numerical simulations to verify our theory.},

Funnel structure, a well-known concept in the marketing field, occurs in those systems where the decision maker interacts with the environment in a layered manner receiving far fewer observations from deep layers than shallow ones. For example, in the email marketing campaign application, the layers correspond to Open, Click and Purchase events. Conversions from Click to Purchase happen very infrequently because a purchase cannot be made unless the link in an email is clicked on. 
We formulate this challenging decision making problem as a contextual bandit with funnel structure and develop a multi-task learning algorithm that mitigates the lack of sufficient observations from deeper layers. We analyze both the prediction error and the regret of our algorithms. We verify our theory on prediction errors through a simple simulation. Experiments on both a simulated environment and an environment based on real-world data from a major email marketing company show that our algorithms offer significant improvement over previous methods.},

In the policy evaluation setting, it can model the linear and nonlinear temporal difference learning with gradient correction (TDC) algorithms as linear SA and nonlinear SA, respectively. In the policy optimization setting, two timescale nonlinear SA can also model the greedy gradient-Q (Greedy-GQ) algorithm. In previous studies, the non-asymptotic analysis of linear TDC and Greedy-GQ has been studied in the Markovian setting, with diminishing or accuracy-dependent stepsize. For the nonlinear TDC algorithm, only the asymptotic convergence has been established. In this paper, we study the non-asymptotic convergence rate of two timescale linear and nonlinear TDC and Greedy-GQ under Markovian sampling and with accuracy-independent constant stepsize. For linear TDC, we provide a novel non-asymptotic analysis and show that it attains an $ε$-accurate solution with the optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1}\log(1/ε))$ under a constant stepsize. For nonlinear TDC and Greedy-GQ, we show that both algorithms attain $ε$-accurate stationary solution with sample complexity $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-2})$. It is the first non-asymptotic convergence result established for nonlinear TDC under Markovian sampling and our result for Greedy-GQ outperforms the previous result orderwisely by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1}\log(1/ε))$.},

Recent research shows that the alternating least-squares solver for k-CCA can be directly accelerated with momentum and prominent performance gain has been observed in practice for the resulting simple algorithm. However, despite the simplicity, it is difficult for the accelerated rate to be analyzed in theory in order to explain and match the empirical performance gain. By looking into two neighboring iterations, in this work, we propose an even simpler variant of the faster alternating least-squares solver. Instead of applying momentum to each update for acceleration, the proposed variant only leverages momentum at every other iteration and can converge at a provably faster linear rate of nearly square-root dependence on the singular value gap of the whitened cross-covariance matrix. In addition to the high consistency between theory and practice, experimental studies also show that our variant of the alternating least-squares algorithm as a block CCA solver is even more pass efficient than other variants. },

 abstract = {Organ transplantation is often the last resort for treating end-stage illness, but the probability of a successful transplantation depends greatly on compatibility between donors and recipients. Current medical practice relies on coarse rules for donor-recipient matching, but is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex factors underlying organ compatibility. In this paper, we formulate the problem of learning data-driven rules for organ matching using observational data for organ allocations and transplant outcomes. This problem departs from the standard supervised learning setup in that it involves matching the two feature spaces (i.e., donors and recipients), and requires estimating transplant outcomes under counterfactual matches not observed in the data. To address these problems, we propose a model based on representation learning to predict donor-recipient compatibility; our model learns representations that cluster donor features, and applies donor-invariant transformations to recipient features to predict outcomes for a given donor-recipient feature instance. Experiments on semi-synthetic and real-world datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-art allocation methods and policies executed by human experts.},

A learner tries to estimate an unknown scalar value, by sequentially querying an external database and receiving binary responses; meanwhile, a third-party adversary observes the learner's queries but not the responses. The learner's goal is to design a querying strategy with the minimum number of queries (optimal query complexity) so that she can accurately estimate the true value, while the eavesdropping adversary even with the complete knowledge of her querying strategy cannot. We develop new querying strategies and analytical techniques and use them to prove tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal query complexity. The bounds almost match across the entire parameter range, substantially improving upon existing results. We thus obtain a complete picture of the optimal query complexity as a function of the estimation accuracy and the desired levels of privacy. We also extend the results to sequential learning models in higher dimensions, and where the binary responses are noisy. Our analysis leverages a crucial insight into the nature of private learning problem, which suggests that the query trajectory of an optimal learner can be divided into distinct phases that focus on pure learning versus learning and obfuscation, respectively.},

Moreover, through the analysis of the MAML ODE, we propose a new BI-MAML training algorithm that significantly reduces the computational burden associated with existing MAML training methods.

By doing so, we can exploit a wide class of networks to approximate the nuisance functions and to estimate the parameters of interest consistently. Therefore, we may offer the best of two worlds: the universal approximation ability from neural networks and the interpretability from classic ordinary linear model, leading to both valid inference and accurate prediction. We show the theoretical foundations that make this possible and demonstrate with numerical experiments. Furthermore, we propose a framework, DebiNet, in which we plug-in arbitrary feature selection methods to our semi-parametric neural network.

Recently, Heng &amp; Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme for HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC, proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time - the time it takes for the coupled chains to meet - based on the notion of local contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic regression and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng &amp; Jacob (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC. These improvements together paves the way for a wider and more practical use of coupled HMC methods.},

 abstract = {A key challenge in scaling Gaussian Process (GP) regression to massive datasets is that exact inference requires computation with a dense n x n kernel matrix, where n is the number of data points. Significant work focuses on approximating the kernel matrix via interpolation using a smaller set of m inducing points. Structured kernel interpolation (SKI) is among the most scalable methods: by placing inducing points on a dense grid and using structured matrix algebra, SKI achieves per-iteration time of O(n + m log m) for approximate inference. This linear scaling in n enables inference for very large data sets; however the cost is per-iteration, which remains a limitation for extremely large n. We show that the SKI per-iteration time can be reduced to O(m log m) after a single O(n) time precomputation step by reframing SKI as solving a natural Bayesian linear regression problem with a fixed set of m compact basis functions. With per-iteration complexity independent of the dataset size n for a fixed grid, our method scales to truly massive data sets. We demonstrate speedups in practice for a wide range of m and n and apply the method to GP inference on a three-dimensional weather radar dataset with over 100 million points.},

We introduce a novel decomposition in its stability analysis to decouple the pairwisely dependent random variables, and derive generalization bounds consistent with pointwise learning. Furthermore, we apply our stability analysis to develop differentially private SGD for pairwise learning, for which our utility bounds match with the state-of-the-art output perturbation method (Huai et al., 2020) with smooth losses. Finally, we illustrate the results using specific examples of AUC maximization and similarity metric learning.

However, in most practical settings, observations are missing not at random (MNAR): the probability that a given entry is observed (also called the propensity) may depend on other entries in the tensor or even on the value of the missing entry. In this paper, we study the problem of completing a partially observed tensor with MNAR observations, without prior information about the propensities. To complete the tensor, we assume that both the original tensor and the tensor of propensities have low multilinear rank. The algorithm first estimates the propensities using a convex relaxation and then predicts missing values using a higher-order SVD approach, reweighting the observed tensor by the inverse propensities. We provide finite-sample error bounds on the resulting complete tensor. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

While they mostly focus on models trained on datasets with predefined labels, we leverage the teacher-student framework and assume a teacher model, or oracle, to provide the labels for given instances. We extend Tian (2019) in the case of low-rank input data and show that student specialization (trained student neuron is highly correlated with certain teacher neuron at the same layer) still happens within the input subspace, but the teacher and student nodes could differ wildly out of the data subspace, which we conjecture leads to adversarial examples. Extensive experiments show that student specialization correlates strongly with model robustness in different scenarios, including student trained via standard training, adversarial training, confidence-calibrated adversarial training, and training with robust feature dataset. Our studies could shed light on the future exploration about adversarial examples, and enhancing model robustness via principled data augmentation.},

To address this problem, sketching and stochastic gradient methods are the most commonly used techniques to derive efficient large-scale learning algorithms. In this study, we consider solving a binary classification problem using random features and stochastic gradient descent. In recent research, an exponential convergence rate of the expected classification error under the strong low-noise condition has been shown. We extend these analyses to a random features setting, analyzing the error induced by the approximation of random features in terms of the distance between the generated hypothesis including population risk minimizers and empirical risk minimizers when using general Lipschitz loss functions, to show that an exponential convergence of the expected classification error is achieved even if random features approximation is applied. Additionally, we demonstrate that the convergence rate does not depend on the number of features and there is a significant computational benefit in using random features in classification problems because of the strong low-noise condition.},

We address this problem by simultaneously evaluating all policies in a policy class $\Pi$ -- uniform convergence in OPE -- and obtain nearly optimal error bounds for a number of global / local policy classes. Our results imply that the model-based planning achieves an optimal episode complexity of $\widetilde{O}(H^3/d_m\epsilon^2)$ in identifying an $\epsilon$-optimal policy under the time-inhomogeneous episodic MDP model ($H$ is the planning horizon, $d_m$ is a quantity that reflects the exploration of the logging policy $\mu$).

 abstract = {In this paper, we analyze the generalization performance of the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm widely used for sparse recovery problems. The parameter estimation and sparsity recovery consistency of IHT has long been known in compressed sensing. From the perspective of statistical learning, another fundamental question is how well the IHT estimation would predict on unseen data. This paper makes progress towards answering this open question by introducing a novel sparse generalization theory for IHT under the notion of algorithmic stability. Our theory reveals that: 1) under natural conditions on the empirical risk function over $n$ samples of dimension $p$, IHT with sparsity level $k$ enjoys an $\mathcal{\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{k\log(n)\log(p)})$ rate of convergence in sparse excess risk; 2) a tighter $\mathcal{\tilde O}(n^{-1/2}\sqrt{\log(n)})$ bound can be established by imposing an additional iteration stability condition on a hypothetical IHT procedure invoked to the population risk; and 3) a fast rate of order $\mathcal{\tilde O}\left(n^{-1}k(\log^3(n)+\log(p))\right)$ can be derived for strongly convex risk function under proper strong-signal conditions. The results have been substantialized to sparse linear regression and sparse logistic regression models to demonstrate the applicability of our theory. Preliminary numerical evidence is provided to confirm our theoretical predictions.},

Rather than learning from rewards which suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we consider learning an options-type hierarchical policy from expert demonstrations. Such a problem is referred to as hierarchical imitation learning. Converting this problem to parameter inference in a latent variable model, we theoretically characterize the EM approach proposed by Daniel et al. (2016). The population level algorithm is analyzed as an intermediate step, which is nontrivial due to the samples being correlated. If the expert policy can be parameterized by a variant of the options framework, then under regularity conditions, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges with high probability to a norm ball around the true parameter. To our knowledge, this is the first performance guarantee for an hierarchical imitation learning algorithm that only observes primitive state-action pairs.},

For example, the well-known âdifference-in-differencesâ method assumes that confounding remains constant across time periods. Similarly, it is not unreasonable to assume that causal effects apply equally to units undergoing interference. Finally, sensitivity analysis often hypothesizes equality among existing and unaccounted for confounders. Despite the ubiquity of these âequality constraints,â modern identification methods have not leveraged their presence in a systematic way. In this paper, we develop a novel graphical criterion that extends the well-known method of generalized instrumental sets to exploit such additional constraints for causal identification in linear models. We further demonstrate how it solves many diverse problems found in the literature in a general way, including difference-in-differences, interference, as well as benchmarking in sensitivity analysis. },

However, game dynamics is more complex due to the interaction between different players and is therefore fundamentally different from minimization, posing new challenges for algorithm design. Notably, it has been shown that negative momentum is preferred due to its ability to reduce oscillation in game dynamics. Nevertheless, the convergence rate of negative momentum was only established in simple bilinear games. In this paper, we extend the analysis to smooth and strongly-convex strongly-concave minimax games by taking the variational inequality formulation. By connecting momentum method with Chebyshev polynomials, we show that negative momentum accelerates convergence of game dynamics locally, though with a suboptimal rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \emph{first work} that provides an explicit convergence rate for negative momentum in this setting.},

This paper provides convergence guarantees for estimating the GOT distance under more general settings. For the Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance in $d$ dimensions, our results require only the existence of a moment greater than $d + 2p$. For the special case of sub-gamma distributions, we quantify the dependence on the dimension $d$ and establish a phase transition with respect to the scale parameter. We also prove convergence for dependent samples, only requiring a condition on the pairwise dependence of the samples measured by the covariance of the feature map of a kernel space. 
A key step in our analysis is to show that the GOT distance is dominated by a family of kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) distances with a kernel that depends on the cost function as well as the amount of Gaussian smoothing. This insight provides further interpretability for the GOT framework and also introduces a class of kernel MMD distances with desirable properties. The theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments.},

In this paper, we study the global convergence of the actor-critic algorithm for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) with exponential utility, which remains challenging for policy optimization as it lacks the linearity needed to formulate policy gradient. To bypass such an issue of nonlinearity, we resort to the equivalence between RSRL and robust adversarial reinforcement learning (RARL), which is formulated as a zero-sum Markov game with a hypothetical adversary. In particular, the Nash equilibrium (NE) of such a game yields the optimal policy for RSRL, which is provably robust. We focus on a simple yet fundamental setting known as linear-quadratic (LQ) game. To attain the optimal policy, we develop a nested natural actor-critic algorithm, which provably converges to the NE of the LQ game at a sublinear rate, thus solving both RSRL and RARL. To the best knowledge, the proposed nested actor-critic algorithm appears to be the ï¬rst model-free policy optimization algorithm that provably attains the optimal policy for RSRL and RARL in the LQ setting, which sheds light on more general settings. },

Given that state-of-the-art GNNs share many similarities with their CNN cousins and that CNNs suffer adversarial vulnerabilities, there has also been interest in exploring analogous vulnerabilities in GNNs. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated that node classification performance of several graph models, including the popular graph convolution network (GCN) model, can be severely degraded through adversarial perturbations to the graph structure and the node features. In this work, we take a first step towards detecting adversarial attacks against graph models. We first propose a straightforward single node threshold test for detecting nodes subject to targeted attacks. Subsequently, we describe a kernel-based two-sample test for detecting whether a given subset of nodes within a graph has been maliciously corrupted. The efficacy of our algorithms is established via thorough experiments using commonly used node classification benchmark datasets. We also illustrate the potential practical benefit of our detection method by demonstrating its application to a real-world Bitcoin transaction network. },

For Gaussian data matrices, we propose a first order Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) under the Approximate Message Passing regime.

 abstract = {Bayesian experimental design (BED) is to answer the question that how to choose designs that maximize the information gathering. For implicit models, where the likelihood is intractable but sampling is possible, conventional BED methods have difficulties in efficiently estimating the posterior distribution and maximizing the mutual information (MI) between data and parameters. Recent work proposed the use of gradient ascent to maximize a lower bound on MI to deal with these issues. However, the approach requires a sampling path to compute the pathwise gradient of the MI lower bound with respect to the design variables, and such a pathwise gradient is usually inaccessible for implicit models. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages recent advances in stochastic approximate gradient ascent incorporated with a smoothed variational MI estimator for efficient and robust BED. Without the necessity of pathwise gradients, our approach allows the design process to be achieved through a unified procedure with an approximate gradient for implicit models. Several experiments show that our approach outperforms baseline methods, and significantly improves the scalability of BED in high-dimensional problems.},

 abstract = {Viewing optimization methods as numerical integrators for ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provides a thought-provoking modern framework for studying accelerated first-order optimizers. In this literature, acceleration is often supposed to be linked to the quality of the integrator (accuracy, energy preservation, symplecticity). In this work, we propose a novel ordinary differential equation that questions this connection: both the explicit and the semi-implicit (a.k.a symplectic) Euler discretizations on this ODE lead to an accelerated algorithm for convex programming. Although semi-implicit methods are well-known in numerical analysis to enjoy many desirable features for the integration of physical systems, our findings show that these properties do not necessarily relate to acceleration.},

 abstract = {Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) is a promising framework for learning control in a data-efficient manner. MBRL algorithms can be fairly complex due to the separate dynamics modeling and the subsequent planning algorithm, and as a result, they often possess tens of hyperparameters and architectural choices. For this reason, MBRL typically requires significant human expertise before it can be applied to new problems and domains. To alleviate this problem, we propose to use automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO). We demonstrate that this problem can be tackled effectively with automated HPO, which we demonstrate to yield significantly improved performance compared to human experts. In addition, we show that tuning of several MBRL hyperparameters dynamically, i.e. during the training itself, further improves the performance compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept fixed for the whole training. Finally, our experiments provide valuable insights into the effects of several hyperparameters, such as plan horizon or learning rate and their influence on the stability of training and resulting rewards.},

We address the problem of active learning under label shift and propose ALLS, the first framework for active learning under label shift. ALLS builds on label shift estimation techniques to correct for label shift with a balance of importance weighting and class-balanced sampling. We show a bias-variance trade-off between these two techniques and prove error and sample complexity bounds for a disagreement-based algorithm under ALLS. Experiments across a range of label shift settings demonstrate ALLS consistently improves performance, often reducing sample complexity by more than half an order of magnitude.

 abstract = { To achieve label efficiency for training supervised learning models, pool-based active learning sequentially selects samples from a set of candidates as queries to label by optimizing an acquisition function. One category of existing methods adopts one-step-look-ahead strategies based on acquisition functions tailored with the learning objectives, for example based on the expected loss reduction (ELR) or the mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU) proposed recently. These active learning methods are optimal with the maximum classification error reduction when one considers a single query. However, it is well-known that there is no performance guarantee in the long run for these myopic methods. In this paper, we show that these methods are not guaranteed to converge to the optimal classifier of the true model because MOCU is not strictly concave. Moreover, we suggest a strictly concave approximation of MOCUâSoft MOCUâthat can be used to define an acquisition function to guide Bayesian active learning with theoretical convergence guarantee. For training Bayesian classifiers with both synthetic and real-world data, our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of active learning by Soft MOCU compared to other existing methods. },

Federated $f$-differential privacy operates on record level: it provides the privacy guarantee on each individual record of one client's data against adversaries. We then propose a generic private federated learning framework {PriFedSync} that accommodates a large family of state-of-the-art FL algorithms, which provably achieves federated $f$-differential privacy.

 abstract = { We study a novel curriculum learning scheme where in each round, samples are selected to achieve the greatest progress and fastest learning speed towards the ground-truth on all available samples. Inspired by an analysis of optimization dynamics under gradient flow for both regression and classification, the problem reduces to selecting training samples by a score computed from samplesâ residual and linear temporal dynamics. It encourages the model to focus on the samples at learning frontier, i.e., those with large loss but fast learning speed. The scores in discrete time can be estimated via already-available byproducts of training, and thus require a negligible amount of extra computation. We discuss the properties and potential advantages of the proposed dynamics optimization via current deep learning theory and empirical study. By integrating it with cyclical training of neural networks, we introduce "dynamics-optimized curriculum learning (DoCL)", which selects the training set for each step by weighted sampling based on the scores. On nine different datasets, DoCL significantly outperforms random mini-batch SGD and recent curriculum learning methods both in terms of efficiency and final performance. },

We study the principal subspace estimation of $\mathbf{L}_0$ through observations $\mathbf{y}_j = f(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{x}_j$, $j=1,â¦,n$, where $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an unknown polynomial and $\mathbf{x}_j$âs are i.i.d. random input signals. Such models are widely used in graph signal processing to model information diffusion dynamics over networks with applications in network topology inference and data analysis. We develop an estimation procedure based on nuclear norm penalization, and establish upper bounds on the principal subspace estimation error when $\mathbf{A}$ is the adjacency matrix of a random graph generated by $\mathbf{L}_0$. Our theory shows that when the signal strength is strong enough, the exact rank of $\mathbf{L}_0$ can be recovered. By applying our results to blind community detection, we show that consistency of spectral clustering can be achieved for some popular stochastic block models. Together with the experimental results, our theory show that there is a fundamental limit of using the principal components obtained from diffused graph signals which is commonly adapted in current practice. Finally, under some structured perturbation $\mathbf{S}_0$, we build the connection between this model with spiked covariance model and develop a new estimation procedure. We show that such estimators can be optimal under the minimax paradigm. },

In this paper, we provide a distributionally robust formulation of offline learning policy in tabular RL that aims to learn a policy from historical data (collected by some other behavior policy) that is robust to the future environment arising as a perturbation of the training environment. We first develop a novel policy evaluation scheme that accurately estimates the robust value (i.e. how robust it is in a perturbed environment) of any given policy and establish its finite-sample estimation error. Building on this, we then develop a novel and minimax-optimal distributionally robust learning algorithm that achieves $O_P\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ regret, meaning that with high probability, the policy learned from using $n$ training data points will be $O\left(1/\sqrt{n}\right)$ close to the optimal distributionally robust policy. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of our distributionally robust approach compared to non-robust RL algorithms. },

This perspective unifies multiple existing robust and stochastic optimization methods. We prove a theorem that generalizes the classical duality in the mathematical problem of moments. Enabled by this theorem, we reformulate the maximization with respect to measures in DRO into the dual program that searches for RKHS functions. Using universal RKHSs, the theorem applies to a broad class of loss functions, lifting common limitations such as polynomial losses and knowledge of the Lipschitz constant.
