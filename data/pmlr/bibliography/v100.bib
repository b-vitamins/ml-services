  abstract = 	 {We present a model-based reinforcement learning framework for robot locomotion that achieves walking based on only 4.5 minutes of data collected on a quadruped robot. To accurately model the robotâs dynamics over a long horizon, we introduce a loss function that tracks the modelâs prediction over multiple timesteps. We adapt model predictive control to account for planning latency, which allows the learned model to be used for real time control. Additionally, to ensure safe exploration during model learning, we embed prior knowledge of leg trajectories into the action space. The resulting system achieves fast and robust locomotion. Unlike model-free methods, which optimize for a particular task, our planner can use the same learned dynamics for various tasks, simply by changing the reward function.1 To the best of our knowledge, our approach is more than an order of magnitude more sample efficient than current model-free methods.}

While most imitation learning methods aim to mimic an expert skill by following the demonstration step-by-step, imitating every step in the demonstration often becomes infeasible when the learner and its environment are different from the demonstration. In this paper, we propose a method that can imitate a demonstration composed solely of observations, which may not be reproducible with the current agent. Our method, dubbed selective imitation learning from observations (SILO), selects reachable states in the demonstration and learns how to reach the selected states. Our experiments on both simulated and real robot environments show that our method reliably performs a new task by following a demonstration.

However, there are many settings where the supervisor may evolve during policy learning, such as a human performing a novel task or an improving algorithmic controller. We formalize imitation learning from a âconverging supervisorâ and provide sublinear static and dynamic regret guarantees against the best policy in hindsight with labels from the converged supervisor, even when labels during learning are only from intermediate supervisors. We then show that this framework is closely connected to a class of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms known as dual policy iteration (DPI), which alternate between training a reactive learner with imitation learning and a model-based supervisor with data from the learner. Experiments suggest that when this framework is applied with the state-of-the-art deep model-based RL algorithm PETS as an improving supervisor, it outperforms deep RL baselines on continuous control tasks and provides up to an 80-fold speedup in policy evaluation.}

We present Cascaded Variational Inference Planner (CAVIN), a model-based method that hierarchically generates plans by sampling from latent spaces. To facilitate planning over long time horizons, our method learns latent representations that decouple the prediction of high-level effects from the generation of low-level motions through cascaded variational inference. This enables us to model dynamics at two different levels of temporal resolutions for hierarchical planning. We evaluate our approach in three multi-step robotic manipulation tasks in cluttered tabletop environments given raw visual observations. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art model-based approaches by strategically planning for interactions with multiple objects.

Our single-shot neural network architecture can predict amodal grasp proposal efficiently and effectively.

We show that this challenging learning problem can be simplified by decomposing it into two stages. We first train an agent that has access to privileged information. This privileged agent cheats by observing the ground-truth layout of the environment and the positions of all traffic participants. In the second stage, the privileged agent acts as a teacher that trains a purely vision-based sensorimotor agent. The resulting sensorimotor agent does not have access to any privileged information and does not cheat. This two-stage training procedure is counter-intuitive at first, but has a number of important advantages that we analyze and empirically demonstrate. We use the presented approach to train a vision-based autonomous driving system that substantially outperforms the state of the art on the CARLA benchmark and the recent NoCrash benchmark. Our approach achieves, for the first time, 100% success rate on all tasks in the original CARLA benchmark, sets a new record on the NoCrash benchmark, and reduces the frequency of infractions by an order of magnitude compared to the prior state of the art.}

It is challenging in large part due to the highly uncertain and multimodal set of possible outcomes in real-world domains such as autonomous driving. Beyond single MAP trajectory prediction [1, 2], obtaining an accurate probability distribution of the future is an area of active interest [3, 4]. We present MultiPath, which leverages a fixed set of future state-sequence anchors that correspond to modes of the trajectory distribution. At inference, our model predicts a discrete distribution over the anchors and, for each anchor, regresses offsets from anchor waypoints along with uncertainties, yielding a Gaussian mixture at each time step. Our model is efficient, requiring only one forward inference pass to obtain multi-modal future distributions, and the output is parametric, allowing compact communication and analytical probabilistic queries. We show on several datasets that our model achieves more accurate predictions, and compared to sampling baselines, does so with an order of magnitude fewer trajectories.}

Our method hinges on the use of hierarchical sim2real â a simulated environment is used to learn low-level goal-reaching skills, which are then used as the action space for a high-level RL controller, also trained in simulation. The full hierarchical policy is then transferred to the real world in a zero-shot fashion. The application of domain randomization during training enables the learned behaviors to generalize to real-world settings, while the use of hierarchy provides a modular paradigm for learning and transferring increasingly complex behaviors. We evaluate our method on a number of real-world tasks, including coordinated object manipulation in a multi-agent setting.}

Although they optimize generic detection performance, such as mean average precision (mAP), they are not designed for robustness or verifiability. We argue that, if a high confidence detection is made by a robot perception system, we would want high certainty that the object has indeed been detected. We present a detection system that can verify, with high precision, whether each detection of a machine-learning based object detector is correct or not. We present a set of verification checks based on a novel approach of using dense pixel correspondences between known images of objects and a scene, to verify whether the detections made in the scene are correct. We motivate this by developing a theoretical framework which proves that under certain assumptions, our proposed method will reject any false positives. We show that these tests can improve the overall accuracy of a base detector and that accepted examples are highly likely to be correct. This allows the detector to operate in a high precision regime, and can thus be used for robotic perception systems as a reliable instance detection method.

Recovery from a failed grasp is further complicated by visual occlusion, as the hand is usually occluding the vision sensor as it attempts another open-loop regrasp. This work presents MAT, a tactile closed-loop method capable of realizing grasps provided by a coarse initial positioning of the hand above an object. Our algorithm is a deep reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimized through the clipped surrogate objective within a maximum entropy RL framework to balance exploitation and exploration. The method utilizes tactile and proprioceptive information to act through both fine finger motions and larger regrasp movements to execute stable grasps. A novel curriculum of action motion magnitude makes learning more tractable and helps turn common failure cases into successes. Careful selection of features that exhibit small sim-to-real gaps enables this tactile grasping policy, trained purely in simulation, to transfer well to real world environments without the need for additional learning. Experimentally, this methodology improves over a vision-only grasp success rate substantially on a multi-fingered robot hand. When this methodology is used to realize grasps from coarse initial positions provided by a vision-only planner, the system is made dramatically more robust to calibration errors in the camera-robot transform.}

We demonstrate the approach on reaching tasks with 7-DoF manipulators in simulation and on a real robot.

However, in cases where the dynamics of an environment may be state dependent and varying, behaviour cloning places a burden on model capacity and the number of demonstrations required.This paper introduces switching density networks, which rely on a categorical reparametrisation for hybrid system identification. This results in a network comprising a classification layer that is followed by a regression layer. We use switching density networks to predict the parameters of hybrid control laws, which are toggled by a switching layer to produce different controller outputs, when conditioned on an input state. This work shows how switching density networks can be used for hybrid system identification in a variety of tasks, successfully identifying the key joint angle goals that make up manipulation tasks, while simultaneously learning image-based goal classifiers and regression networks that predict joint angles from images. We also show that they can cluster the phase space of an inverted pendulum, identifying the balance, spin and pump controllers required to solve this task. Switching density networks can be difficult to train, but we introduce a cross entropy regularisation loss that stabilises training.}

To alleviate this challenge, we present ADACORL, a framework to specify decision-making models and generate robot behavior for interaction. Central to our approach are a factored task model and a semi-supervised algorithm to learn models of human behavior. We demonstrate that our specification approach, despite significantly fewer labels, generates models (and policies) that perform equally well or better than models learned with supervised data. By leveraging pre-computed performance bounds and an online planner, ADACORL can generate robot behavior for collaborative tasks with large state spaces (> 1 million states) and short planning times (< 0.5 s).}

  abstract = 	 {RMPflow is a recently proposed policy-fusion framework based on differential geometry. While RMPflow has demonstrated promising performance, it requires the user to provide sensible subtask policies as Riemannian motion policies (RMPs: a motion policy and an importance matrix function), which can be a difficult design problem in its own right. We propose RMPfusion, a variation of RMPflow, to address this issue. RMPfusion supplements RMPflow with weight functions that can hierarchically reshape the Lyapunov functions of the subtask RMPs according to the current configuration of the robot and environment. This extra flexibility can remedy imperfect subtask RMPs provided by the user, improving the combined policyâs performance. These weight functions can be learned by back-propagation. Moreover, we prove that, under mild restrictions on the weight functions, RMPfusion always yields a globally Lyapunov-stable motion policy. This implies that we can treat RMPfusion as a structured policy class in policy optimization that is guaranteed to generate stable policies, even during the immature phase of learning. We demonstrate these properties of RMPfusion in imitation learning experiments both in simulation and on a real-world robot.}

The proposed information processing architecture is used to support a perceptual attention-based predictive control algorithm that leverages model predictive control (MPC), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and uncertainty quantification methods. The novelty of our approach lies in using MPC to learn how to place attention on relevant areas of the visual input, which ultimately allows the system to more rapidly detect unsafe conditions. We accomplish this by using MPC to learn to select regions of interest in the input image, which are used to output control actions as well as estimates of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in the attention-aware visual input. We use these uncertainty estimates to quantify the safety of our network controller under the current navigation condition. The proposed architecture and algorithm is tested on a 1:5 scale terrestrial vehicle. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms previous approaches on early detection of unsafe conditions, such as when novel obstacles are present in the navigation environment. The proposed architecture is the first step towards using deep learning-based perceptual control policies in safety-critical domains.}

However, its performance may be seriously compromised when the parameter space is high-dimensional. A way to tackle this problem is to introduce domain knowledge into the BO framework. We propose to exploit the geometry of non-Euclidean parameter spaces, which often arise in robotics (e.g. orientation, stiffness matrix). Our approach, built on Riemannian manifold theory, allows BO to properly measure similarities in the parameter space through geometry-aware kernel functions and to optimize the acquisition function on the manifold as an unconstrained problem. We test our approach in several benchmark artificial landscapes and using a 7-DOF simulated robot to learn orientation and impedance parameters for manipulation skills.}

Probabilistic ensembles with trajectory sampling (PETS) is a leading type of MBRL, which employs Bayesian inference to dynamics modeling and model predictive control (MPC) with stochastic optimization via the cross entropy method (CEM). In this paper, we propose a novel extension to the uncertainty-aware MBRL. Our main contributions are twofold: Firstly, we introduce a variational inference MPC (VI-MPC), which reformulates various stochastic methods, including CEM, in a Bayesian fashion. Secondly, we propose a novel instance of the framework, called probabilistic action ensembles with trajectory sampling (PaETS). As a result, our Bayesian MBRL can involve multimodal uncertainties both in dynamics and optimal trajectories. In comparison to PETS, our method consistently improves asymptotic performance on several challenging locomotion tasks.}

We thus adopt a skill-centric approach where each skill is learned independently under various scenarios but not attached to any specific task. Afterwards, complex manipulation tasks can be achieved by composing these skills in sequence or parallel. One essential challenge there is to optimize the parameters of each skill such that the success rate of the whole task is maximized. Common approaches require first a discretization of the state or action space to generate such parameters and second a precise simulator to evaluate the performances under different parameters. Instead, we propose to learn task-parameterized models of each skill directly from few human demonstrations. Such models allow us to infer the success rate of executing a skill within a new scenario conveniently, via computing a novel measure of execution confidence. This measure encapsulates both the robot state and the workspace configuration. Furthermore, we introduce task-parameterized transition skills that change the object poses of interest via translation and rotation. We show that such skills can be extremely useful for changing skill parameters and thus potentially improving the success rate of a given task. The proposed scheme optimizes skill parameters in the continuous domain without the need for simulators. We demonstrate the proposed approach on a 7 DoF robot arm solving various manipulation tasks.}

Traditionally, the motion and task planning of multi-agent systems are tackled by either designing ad-hoc decision rules or employing optimization tools. The former requires intensive manual tuning while the latter needs a static and accurate model of the complete system. Both approaches are prone to uncertainties in the robot motion and task execution. In this work, we propose a novel planning framework based on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning. The framework combines a centralized safety policy that acts on direct predictions of future resource levels and a decentralized task policy that optimizes task completions. The safety network is trained using supervised learning without extraneous supervision, while the task policy is trained using concurrent self-play. The whole framework follows a hierarchical structure to avoid the exponential blowup in the state and action space. We demonstrate significant improvements in a practical logistic planning problem for warehouse robots, compared with heuristic solutions, optimization tools and other reinforcement learning methods.}

In this paper, we describe and document an iterative design approach, which reflects the multiple design iterations of the reward that are often (if not always) needed in practice. Throughout the process, transfer learning is achieved via Deterministic Action Stochastic State (DASS) tuples, representing the deterministic policy actions associated with states visited by the stochastic policy. We demonstrate the transfer of policies learned in simulation to the physical robot without dynamics randomization. We also identify several key components that are critical for sim-to-real transfer in our setting.}

While recent empirical results demonstrate that ranked demonstrations allow for better-than-demonstrator performance, preferences over demonstrations may be difficult to obtain, and little is known theoretically about when such methods can be expected to successfully extrapolate beyond the performance of the demonstrator. To address these issues, we first contribute a sufficient condition for better-than-demonstrator imitation learning and provide theoretical results showing why preferences over demonstrations can better reduce reward function ambiguity when performing inverse reinforcement learning. Building on this theory, we introduce Disturbance-based Reward Extrapolation (D-REX), a ranking-based imitation learning method that injects noise into a policy learned through behavioral cloning to automatically generate ranked demonstrations. These ranked demonstrations are used to efficiently learn a reward function that can then be optimized using reinforcement learning. We empirically validate our approach on simulated robot and Atari imitation learning benchmarks and show that D-REX outperforms standard imitation learning approaches and can significantly surpass the performance of the demonstrator. D-REX is the first imitation learning approach to achieve significant extrapolation beyond the demonstratorâs performance without additional side-information or supervision, such as rewards or human preferences. By generating rankings automatically, we show that preference-based inverse reinforcement learning can be applied in traditional imitation learning settings where only unlabeled demonstrations are available.}

This has been shown to improve exploration and robustness, and it tackles the value overestimation problem. It also leads to a significant performance increase in tabular and high-dimensional settings, as demonstrated via algorithms such as soft Q-learning (SQL) and soft actor-critic (SAC). Cumulative entropy regularization has been extended to optimize over the reference marginal policy instead of keeping it fixed, yielding a regularization that minimizes the mutual information between states and actions. While this has been initially proposed for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in tabular settings, it was recently shown that a similar principle leads to significant improvements over vanilla SQL in RL for high-dimensional domains with discrete actions and function approximators. Here, we follow the motivation of mutual-information regularization from an inference perspective and theoretically analyze the corresponding Bellman operator. Inspired by this Bellman operator, we devise a novel mutual-information regularized actor-critic learning (MIRACLE) algorithm for continuous action spaces that optimizes over the reference marginal policy. We empirically validate MIRACLE in the Mujoco robotics simulator, where we demonstrate that it can compete with contemporary RL methods. Most notably, it can improve over the model-free state-of-the-art SAC algorithm which implicitly assumes a fixed reference policy.}

However, it is challenging to use model-based methods in settings where the environment is a priori unknown and can only be observed partially through onboard sensors on the robot. In this work, we address this short-coming by coupling model-based control with learning-based perception. The learning-based perception module produces a series of waypoints that guide the robot to the goal via a collision-free path. These waypoints are used by a model-based planner to generate a smooth and dynamically feasible trajectory that is executed on the physical system using feedback control. Our experiments in simulated real-world cluttered environments and on an actual ground vehicle demonstrate that the proposed approach can reach goal locations more reliably and efficiently in novel environments as compared to purely geometric mapping-based or end-to-end learning-based alternatives. Our approach does not rely on detailed explicit 3D maps of the environment, works well with low frame rates, and generalizes well from simulation to the real world. Videos describing our approach and experiments are available on the project website4.}

  abstract = 	 {The ability to discover approximately optimal policies in domains with sparse rewards is crucial to applying reinforcement learning (RL) in many real-world scenarios. Approaches such as neural density models and continuous exploration (e.g., Go-Explore) have been proposed to maintain the high exploration rate necessary to find high performing and generalizable policies. Soft actor-critic (SAC) is another method for improving exploration that aims to combine efficient learning via off-policy updates, while maximizing the policy entropy. In this work, we extend SAC to a richer class of probability distributions (e.g., multimodal) through normalizing flows (NF) and show that this significantly improves performance by accelerating discovery of good policies while using much smaller policy representations. Our approach, which we call SAC-NF, is a simple, efficient, easy-to-implement modification and improvement to SAC on continuous control baselines such as MuJoCo and PyBullet Roboschool domains. Finally, SAC-NF does this while being significantly parameter efficient, using as few as 5.5% the parameters for an equivalent SAC model.}

Existing techniques for closing the reality gap by approximating real-world physics often require extensive real world data and/or thousands of simulation samples. This paper presents TuneNet, a new machine learning-based method to directly tune the parameters of one model to match another using an iterative residual tuning technique. TuneNet estimates the parameter difference between two models using a single observation from the target and minimal simulation, allowing rapid, accurate and sample-efficient parameter estimation. The system can be trained via supervised learning over an auto-generated simulated dataset. We show that TuneNet can perform system identification even when the true parameter values lie well outside the distribution seen during training, and demonstrate that simulators tuned with TuneNet outperform existing techniques for predicting rigid body motion. Finally, we show that our method can estimate real-world parameter values, allowing a robot to perform sim-to-real task transfer on a dynamic manipulation task unseen during training.

This is a very challenging setting even for data- efficient approaches like Bayesian optimization (BO), especially when optimizing higher-dimensional controllers. Previous work extracted expert-designed low-dimensional features from simulation trajectories to construct informed kernels and run ultra sample-efficient BO on hardware. We remove the need for expert-designed features by proposing a model and architecture for a sequential variational autoencoder that embeds the space of simulated trajectories into a lower-dimensional space of latent paths in an unsupervised way. We further compress the search space for BO by reducing exploration in parts of the state space that are undesirable, without requiring explicit constraints on controller parameters. We validate our approach with hardware experiments on a Daisy hexapod robot and an ABB Yumi manipulator. We also present simulation experiments with further comparisons to several baselines on Daisy and two manipulators. Our experiments indicate the proposed trajectory-based kernel with dynamic compression can offer ultra data-efficient optimization.}

Initially viewed as a direct regression problem, requiring annotated labels as supervision at training time, in the past few years a substantial amount of work has been done in self-supervised depth training based on strong geometric cues, both from stereo cameras and more recently from monocular video sequences. In this paper we investigate how these two approaches (supervised & self-supervised) can be effectively combined, so that a depth model can learn to encode true scale from sparse supervision while achieving high fidelity local accuracy by leveraging geometric cues. To this end, we propose a novel supervised loss term that complements the widely used photometric loss, and show how it can be used to train robust semi-supervised monocular depth estimation models. Furthermore, we evaluate how much supervision is actually necessary to train accurate scale-aware monocular depth models, showing that with our proposed framework, very sparse LiDAR information, with as few as 4 beams (less than 100 valid depth values per image), is enough to achieve results competitive with the current state-of-the-art.}

We introduce a novel relative entropy reinforcement learning algorithm that gives the agent the freedom to control the intermediate task distribution, allowing for its gradual progression towards the target context distribution. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed curriculum learning scheme drastically improves sample efficiency and enables learning in scenarios with both broad and sharp target context distributions in which classical approaches perform sub-optimally.}

Instead of learning a large collection of skills individually, can we instead enable a robot to propose and practice its own behaviors automatically, learning about the affordances and behaviors that it can perform in its environment, such that it can then repurpose this knowledge once a new task is commanded by the user? In this paper, we study this question in the context of self-supervised goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. A central challenge in this learning regime is the problem of goal setting: in order to practice useful skills, the robot must be able to autonomously set goals that are feasible but diverse. When the robotâs environment and available objects vary, as they do in most open-world settings, the robot must propose to itself only those goals that it can accomplish in its present setting with the objects that are at hand. Previous work only studies self-supervised goal-conditioned RL in a single-environment setting, where goal proposals come from the robotâs past experience or a generative model are sufficient. In more diverse settings, this frequently leads to impossible goals and, as we show experimentally, prevents effective learning. We propose a conditional goal-setting model that aims to propose goals that are feasible from the robotâs current state. We demonstrate that this enables self-supervised goal-conditioned off-policy learning with raw image observations in the real world, enabling a robot to manipulate a variety of objects and generalize to new objects that were not seen during training.}

To this end, we propose a language-grounded driving agent implementing a hierarchical policy using recurrent layers and gated attention. The hierarchical approach enables us to reason both in terms of high-level language instructions describing long time horizons and low-level, complex, continuous state/action spaces required for real-time control of a self-driving car. We train our policy with conditional imitation learning from realistic language data collected from human drivers and navigators. Through quantitative and interactive experiments within the CARLA framework, we show that our model can successfully interpret language instructions and follow them safely, even when generalizing to previously unseen environments.

Our framework consists of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent and an inverse dynamics model contesting with each other. The former collects training samples for the latter, with an objective to maximize the error of the latter. The latter is trained with samples collected by the former, and generates rewards for the former when it fails to predict the actual action taken by the former. In such a competitive setting, the DRL agent learns to generate samples that the inverse dynamics model fails to predict correctly, while the inverse dynamics model learns to adapt to the challenging samples. We further propose a reward structure that ensures the DRL agent to collect only moderately hard samples but not overly hard ones that prevent the inverse model from predicting effectively. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on several robotic arm and hand manipulation tasks against multiple baseline models. Experimental results show that our method is comparable to those directly trained with expert demonstrations, and superior to the other baselines even without any human priors.}

Recent works got us closer to those goals, addressing non-stationarity of the environment from a single agentâs perspective by utilizing a deep net critic which depends on all observations and actions. The critic input concatenates agent observations and actions in a user-specified order. However, since deep nets arenât permutation invariant, a permuted input changes the critic output despite the environment remaining identical. To avoid this inefficiency, we propose a âpermutation invariant criticâ (PIC), which yields identical output irrespective of the agent permutation. This consistent representation enables our model to scale to 30 times more agents and to achieve improvements of test episode reward between 15% to 50% on the challenging multi-agent particle environment (MPE).}

This type of navigation tasks, which we call Interactive Navigation, requires the use of mobile manipulators: mobile bases with manipulation capabilities. Interactive Navigation tasks are usually long-horizon and composed of heterogeneous phases of pure navigation, pure manipulation, and their combination. Using the wrong part of the embodiment is inefficient and hinders progress. We propose HRL4IN, a novel Hierarchical RL architecture for Interactive Navigation tasks. HRL4IN exploits the exploration benefits of HRL over flat RL for long-horizon tasks thanks to temporally extended commitments towards subgoals. Different from other HRL solutions, HRL4IN handles the heterogeneous nature of the Interactive Navigation task by creating subgoals in different spaces in different phases of the task. Moreover, HRL4IN selects different parts of the embodiment to use for each phase, improving energy efficiency. We evaluate HRL4IN against flat PPO and HAC, a state-of-the-art HRL algorithm, on Interactive Navigation in two environments - a 2D grid-world environment and a 3D environment with physics simulation. We show that HRL4IN significantly outperforms its baselines in terms of task performance and energy efficiency. More information is available at https://sites.google.com/view/hrl4in.}

By exploiting the inherent structure of the robot dynamics and strictly convex action cost, we derive principled cost functions such that the optimal policy naturally obeys the action limits, is globally optimal and stable on the training domain given the optimal value function. The corresponding optimal value function is learned end-to-end by embedding a deep differential network in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellmann differential equation and minimizing the error of this equality while simultaneously decreasing the discounting from short- to far-sighted to enable the learning. Our proposed approach enables us to learn an optimal feedback control law in continuous time, that in contrast to existing approaches generates an optimal trajectory from any point in state-space without the need of replanning. The resulting approach is evaluated on non-linear systems and achieves optimal feedback control, where standard optimal control methods require frequent replanning.}

However, it is well known that DFO methods suffer from prohibitively high sampling complexity. They can also be very sensitive to noisy rewards and stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we propose a new class of algorithms, called Robust Blackbox Optimization (RBO). Remarkably, even if up to 23% of all the measurements are arbitrarily corrupted, RBO can provably recover gradients to high accuracy. RBO relies on learning gradient flows using robust regression methods to enable off-policy updates. On several MuJoCo robot control tasks, when all other RL approaches collapse in the presence of adversarial noise, RBO is able to train policies effectively. We also show that RBO can be applied to legged locomotion tasks including path tracking for quadruped robots.}

Given the intractability of the global control problem, state-of-the-art algorithms focus on approximate sequential optimization techniques, that heavily rely on heuristics for regularization in order to achieve stable convergence. By building upon the duality between inference and control, we develop the view of Optimal Control as Input Estimation, devising a probabilistic stochastic optimal control formulation that iteratively infers the optimal input distributions by minimizing an upper bound of the control cost. Inference is performed through Expectation Maximization and message passing on a probabilistic graphical model of the dynamical system, and time-varying linear Gaussian feedback controllers are extracted from the joint state-action distribution. This perspective incorporates uncertainty quantification, effective initialization through priors, and the principled regularization inherent to the Bayesian treatment. Moreover, it can be shown that for deterministic linearized systems, our framework derives the maximum entropy linear quadratic optimal control law. We provide a complete and detailed derivation of our probabilistic approach and highlight its advantages in comparison to other deterministic and probabilistic solvers.}

Thus, improving over random exploration is crucial to solve long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards. We propose to leverage an ensemble of partial solutions as teachers that guide the agentâs exploration with action suggestions throughout training. While the setup of learning with teachers has been previously studied, our proposed approach â Actor-Critic with Teacher Ensembles (AC-Teach) â is the first to work with an ensemble of suboptimal teachers that may solve only part of the problem or contradict other each other, forming a unified algorithmic solution that is compatible with a broad range of teacher ensembles. AC-Teach leverages a probabilistic representation of the expected outcome of the teachersâ and studentâs actions to direct exploration, reduce dithering, and adapt to the dynamically changing quality of the learner. We evaluate a variant of AC-Teach that guides the learning of a Bayesian DDPG agent on three tasks â path following, robotic pick and place, and robotic cube sweeping using a hook â and show that it improves largely on sampling efficiency over a set of baselines, both for our target scenario of unconstrained suboptimal teachers and for easier setups with optimal or single teachers.

However, when defining the corresponding optimal control or reinforcement learning problem, it is commonly approximated with fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces. These simplifications aim at tailoring the problem to a particular algorithm or solver which may only support one type of action space. Alternatively, expert heuristics are used to remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous space. In contrast, we propose to treat hybrid problems in their ânativeâ form by solving them with hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and continuous actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that the proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement learning problems. We then show, both in simulation and on robotic hardware, the benefits of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly, hybrid reinforcement learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We propose reformulating control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve exploration or reduce mechanical wear and tear.}

Here we propose an alternate approach: instead of not being able to infer whether an action is due to exploration, exploitation, or communication, we define separate roles for each agent. Because each role defines a distinct reason for acting (e.g., only exploit, only communicate), teammates now correctly interpret the meaning behind their partnerâs actions. Our results suggest that leveraging and alternating roles leads to performance comparable to teams that explicitly exchange messages.}

  abstract = 	 {As mobile robots find increasing use in outdoor applications, designing energy-efficient robot navigation algorithms is gaining importance. There are two primary approaches to energy efficient navigation: Offline approaches rely on a previously built energy map as input to a path planner. Obtaining energy maps for large environments is challenging. Alternatively, the robot can navigate in an online fashion and build the map as it navigates. Online navigation in unknown environments with only local information is still a challenging research problem. In this paper, we present a novel approach which addresses both of these challenges. Our approach starts with a segmented aerial image of the environment. We show that a coarse energy map can be built from the segmentation. However, the absolute energy value for a specific terrain type (e.g. grass) can vary across environments. Therefore, rather than using this energy map directly, we use it to build the covariance function for a Gaussian Process (GP) based representation of the environment. In the online phase, energy measurements collected during navigation are used for estimating energy profiles across the environment using GP regression. Coupled with an Aâ-like navigation algorithm, we show in simulations that our approach outperforms representative baseline approaches. We also present results from field experiments which demonstrate the practical applicability of our method.}

In this work, we investigate whether this approach can be extended to 2-agent competitive and cooperative settings. The fundamental challenge is how to learn models that capture interactions between agents, yet are disentangled to allow for optimization of each agent behavior separately. We propose such models based on a disentangled variational auto-encoder, and demonstrate our approach on a simulated 2-robot manipulation task, where one robot can either help or distract the other. We show that our approach has better sample efficiency than a strong model-free RL baseline, and can learn both cooperative and adversarial behavior from the same data.}

We study these questions by integrating a generic perceptual skill set (a distance estimator, an edge detector, etc.) within a reinforcement learning framework (see Fig. 1). This skill set (âmid-level visionâ) provides the policy with a more processed state of the world compared to raw images. Our large-scale study demonstrates that using mid-level vision results in policies that learn faster, generalize better, and achieve higher final performance, when compared to learning from scratch and/or using state-of-the-art visual and non-visual representation learning methods. We show that conventional computer vision objectives are particularly effective in this regard and can be conveniently integrated into reinforcement learning frameworks. Finally, we found that no single visual representation was universally useful for all downstream tasks, hence we computationally derive a task-agnostic set of representations optimized to support arbitrary downstream tasks.}

The GCN reduces the dimensionality of the problem by learning filters that aggregate information among robots locally, similar to how a convolutional neural network is able to learn local features in an image. Through experiments on formation flying, we show that our proposed method is able to scale better than existing reinforcement methods that employ fully connected networks. More importantly, we show that by using our locally learned filters we are able to zero-shot transfer policies trained on just three robots to over hundred robots.

To do so, we study how a teacher algorithm can learn to generate a learning curriculum, whereby it sequentially samples parameters controlling a stochastic procedural generation of environments. Because it does not initially know the capacities of its student, a key challenge for the teacher is to discover which environments are easy, difficult or unlearnable, and in what order to propose them to maximize the efficiency of learning over the learnable ones. To achieve this, this problem is transformed into a surrogate continuous bandit problem where the teacher samples environments in order to maximize absolute learning progress of its student. We present a new algorithm modeling absolute learning progress with Gaussian mixture models (ALP-GMM). We also adapt existing algorithms and provide a complete study in the context of DRL. Using parameterized variants of the BipedalWalker environment, we study their efficiency to personalize a learning curriculum for different learners (embodiments), their robustness to the ratio of learnable/unlearnable environments, and their scalability to non-linear and high-dimensional parameter spaces.

Although compelling, the idea of co-adapting morphology and behaviours in robots is often unfeasible because of the long manufacturing times, and the need to redesign an appropriate controller for each morphology. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatically and efficiently co-adapt a robot morphology and its controller. Our approach is based on recent advances in deep reinforcement learning, and specifically the soft actor critic algorithm. Key to our approach is the possibility of leveraging previously tested morphologies and behaviors to estimate the performance of new candidate morphologies. As such, we can make full use of the information available for making more informed decisions, with the ultimate goal of achieving a more data-efficient co-adaptation (i.e., reducing the number of morphologies and behaviors tested). Simulated experiments show that our approach requires drastically less design prototypes to find good morphology-behaviour combinations, making this method particularly suitable for future co-adaptation of robot designs in the real world.}

We address the case where this inductive bias comes from an exchange with a human user. We propose a method in which a learning agent utilizes the information bottleneck layer of a high-parameter variational neural model, with auxiliary loss terms, in order to ground abstract concepts such as spatial relations. The concepts are referred to in natural language instructions and are manifested in the high-dimensional sensory input stream the agent receives from the world. We evaluate the properties of the latent space of the learned model in a photorealistic synthetic environment and particularly focus on examining its usability for downstream tasks. Additionally, through a series of controlled table-top manipulation experiments, we demonstrate that the learned manifold can be used to ground demonstrations as symbolic plans, which can then be executed on a PR2 robot.}

  abstract = 	 {Robot learning has emerged as a promising tool for taming the complexity and diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as deep networks, hold the promise of providing effective generalization to a wide range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast, most robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and single-robot. This leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we learn generalizable robotic controllers without having to collect impractically large amounts of data for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose RoboNet, an open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation. We combine the dataset with two different learning algorithms: visual foresight, which uses forward video prediction models, and supervised inverse models. Our experiments test the learned algorithmsâ ability to work across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera viewpoints, new grippers, or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment, we find that by pre-training on RoboNet and fine-tuning on data from a held-out Franka or Kuka robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training approach that uses 4x-20x more data.1}

The difficulty associated with obtaining an accurate model for such environments poses a challenge to the task of assessing and guaranteeing the systemâs performance. We present a data-driven solution that allows for a system to be evaluated for specification conformance without an accurate model of the environment. Our approach involves learning a conservative reactive bound of the environmentâs behavior using data and specification of the systemâs desired behavior. First, the approach begins by learning a conservative reactive bound on the environmentâs actions that captures its possible behaviors with high probability. This bound is then used to assist verification, and if the verification fails under this bound, the algorithm returns counter-examples to show how failure occurs and then uses these to refine the bound. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach through two case-studies: i) verifying controllers for a toy multi-robot system, and ii) verifying an instance of human-robot interaction during a lane-change maneuver given real-world human driving data.}

Developing efficient exploration strategies capable of finding the most useful samples becomes critical in such settings. Existing approaches towards finding efficient exploration strategies add auxiliary objectives to promote exploration by the pre-update policy, however, this makes the adaptation using a few gradient steps difficult as the pre-update (exploration) and post-update (exploitation) policies are often quite different. Instead, we propose to explicitly model a separate exploration policy for the task distribution. Having two different policies gives more flexibility in training the exploration policy and also makes adaptation to any specific task easier. We show that using self-supervised or supervised learning objectives for adaptation allows for more efficient inner-loop updates and also demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to prior works in this domain.}

  abstract = 	 {Recent work on 3D object detection advocates point cloud voxelization in birds-eye view, where objects preserve their physical dimensions and are naturally separable. When represented in this view, however, point clouds are sparse and have highly variable point density, which may cause detectors difficulties in detecting distant or small objects (pedestrians, traffic signs, etc.). On the other hand, perspective view provides dense observations, which could allow more favorable feature encoding for such cases. In this paper, we aim to synergize the birds-eye view and the perspective view and propose a novel end-to-end multiview fusion (MVF) algorithm, which can effectively learn to utilize the complementary information from both. Specifically, we introduce dynamic voxelization, which has four merits compared to existing voxelization methods, i) removing the need of pre-allocating a tensor with fixed size; ii) overcoming the information loss due to stochastic point/voxel dropout; iii) yielding deterministic voxel embeddings and more stable detection outcomes; iv) establishing the bi-directional relationship between points and voxels, which potentially lays a natural foundation for cross-view feature fusion. By employing dynamic voxelization, the proposed feature fusion architecture enables each point to learn to fuse context information from different views. MVF operates on points and can be naturally extended to other approaches using LiDAR point clouds. We evaluate our MVF model extensively on the newly released Waymo Open Dataset and on the KITTI dataset and demonstrate that it significantly improves detection accuracy over the comparable single-view PointPillars baseline.}

In this work, we propose a method that differentiates between specified task parameters and learned manner parameters. We would like to allow a designer to specify a subset of the parameters while learning the remaining parameters from a set of demonstrations. This is difficult because the learned parameters need to be interpretable and remain independent of the specified task parameters. To disentangle the parameter sets, we propose a Task-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder (TC-VAE) that conditions on the specified task parameters while learning the rest from demonstrations. We use an adversarial loss function to ensure the learned parameters encode no information about the task parameters. We evaluate our method on pouring demonstrations on a Baxter robot from the MIME dataset. We show that the TC-VAE can generalize to task instances unseen during training and that changing the learned parameters does not affect the success of the motion.}

Often, the recovered reward function fails to explicitly capture implicit constraints (e.g., axis alignment, force, or relative alignment) between the manipulator, the objects of interaction, and other entities in the workspace. The standard IRL approaches do not model the presence of locally-consistent constraints that may be active only in a section of a demonstration. This work introduces Constraint-based Bayesian Nonparametric Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CBN-IRL) that models the observed behaviour as a sequence of subtasks, each consisting of a goal and a set of locally-active constraints. CBN-IRL infers locally-active constraints given a single demonstration by identifying potential constraints and their activation space. Further, the nonparametric prior over subgoals constituting the task allows the model to adapt with the complexity of the demonstration. The inferred set of goals and constraints are then used to recover a control policy via constrained optimization. We evaluate the proposed model in simulated navigation and manipulation domains. CBN-IRL efficiently learns a compact representation for complex tasks that allows generalization in novel environments, outperforming state-of-the-art IRL methods. Finally, we demonstrate the model on two tool-manipulation tasks using a UR5 manipulator and show generalization to novel test scenarios.}

Our method, Experience-embedded Visual Foresight (EVF), jointly learns a fast adaptation module, which encodes observed trajectories of the new object into a vector embedding, and a visual prediction model, which conditions on this embedding to generate physically plausible predictions. For evaluation, we compare our method against baselines on video prediction and benchmark its utility on two real world control tasks.

Our method, while not necessarily perfect at imitation learning, is very amenable to further improvement via environment interaction allowing it to scale to challenging long-horizon tasks. In particular, we simplify the long-horizon policy learning problem by using a novel data-relabeling algorithm for learning goal-conditioned hierarchical policies, where the low-level only acts for a fixed number of steps, regardless of the goal achieved. While we rely on demonstration data to bootstrap policy learning, we do not assume access to demonstrations of specific tasks. Instead, our approach can leverage unstructured and unsegmented demonstrations of semantically meaningful behaviors that are not only less burdensome to provide, but also can greatly facilitate further improvement using reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of multi-stage, long-horizon manipulation tasks in a challenging kitchen simulation environment.}

Being informative is unfortunately very challenging, because during teaching, people typically get no transparency into what the robot already knows or has learned so far. In contrast, human students naturally provide a wealth of nonverbal feedback that reveals their level of understanding and engagement. In this work, we study how a robot can similarly provide feedback that is minimally disruptive, yet gives human teachers a better mental model of the robot learner, and thus enables them to teach more effectively. Our idea is that at any point, the robot can indicate what it thinks the correct next action is, shedding light on its current estimate of the humanâs preferences. We analyze how useful this feedback is, both in theory and with two user studiesâone with a virtual character that tests the feedback itself, and one with a PR2 robot that uses gaze as the feedback mechanism. We find that feedback can be useful for improving both the quality of teaching and teachersâ understanding of the robotâs capability.}

We conduct experiments in simulated and real-life environments using a ground mobility robot with and without obstacles, and compare our models to multiple baseline methods.}

  abstract = 	 {Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have demonstrated the capability of learning complex control policies from many types of environment. When learning policies for safety critical applications, it is important to be sensitive to risks and avoid catastrophic events. Towards this goal, we propose an actor-critic framework which models the uncertainty of the future and simultaneously learns a policy based on that uncertainty model. Specifically, given a distribution of the future return for any state and action, we optimize policies for varying levels of conditional Value-at-Risk. The learned policy can map the same state to different actions depending on the propensity for risk. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the domain of driving simulations, where we learn maneuvers in two scenarios. Our learned controller can dynamically select actions along a continuous axis, where safe and conservative behaviors are found at one end while riskier behaviors are found at the other. Finally, when testing with very different simulation parameters, our risk-averse policies generalize significantly better compared to other reinforcement learning approaches.}

  abstract = 	 {Meta-reinforcement learning algorithms can enable robots to acquire new skills much more quickly, by leveraging prior experience to learn how to learn. However, much of the current research on meta-reinforcement learning focuses on task distributions that are very narrow. For example, a commonly used meta-reinforcement learning benchmark uses different running velocities for a simulated robot as different tasks. When policies are meta-trained on such narrow task distributions, they cannot possibly generalize to more quickly acquire entirely new tasks. Therefore, if the aim of these methods is enable faster acquisition of entirely new behaviors, we must evaluate them on task distributions that are sufficiently broad to enable generalization to new behaviors. In this paper, we propose an open-source simulated benchmark for meta-reinforcement learning and multitask learning consisting of 50 distinct robotic manipulation tasks. Our aim is to make it possible to develop algorithms that generalize to accelerate the acquisition of entirely new, held-out tasks. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art meta-reinforcement learning and multi-task learning algorithms on these tasks. Surprisingly, while each task and its variations (e.g., with different object positions) can be learned with reasonable success, these algorithms struggle to learn with multiple tasks at the same time, even with as few as ten distinct training tasks. Our analysis and open-source environments pave the way for future research in multi-task learning and meta-learning that can enable meaningful generalization, thereby unlocking the full potential of these methods.1.}

However, many of the more complex behaviors are also notoriously difficult to control: Performing in-hand object manipulation, executing finger gaits to move objects, and exhibiting precise fine motor skills such as writing, all require finely balancing contact forces, breaking and reestablishing contacts repeatedly, and maintaining control of unactuated objects. Learning-based techniques provide the appealing possibility of acquiring these skills directly from data, but current learning approaches either require large amounts of data and produce task-specific policies, or they have not yet been shown to scale up to more complex and realistic tasks requiring fine motor skills. In this work, we demonstrate that our method of online planning with deep dynamics models (PDDM) addresses both of these limitations; we show that improvements in learned dynamics models, together with improvements in on-line model-predictive control, can indeed enable efficient and effective learning of flexible contact-rich dexterous manipulation skills â and that too, on a 24-DoF anthropomorphic hand in the real world, using just 4 hours of purely real-world data to learn to simultaneously coordinate multiple free-floating objects.

In this work, we propose self-supervising control on top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state. Play is naturally rich, covering â¼4x more interaction space than task demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this combination generalizes well empiricallyâafter self-supervising on unlabeled play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike their expert-trained counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally, we find that our agent organizes its latent plan space around functional tasks, despite never being trained with task labels.

The first objective is to learn semantic and instance-boundary detectors without manual labeling. An adversarial training framework in conjunction with physics-based simulation is used to achieve detectors that behave similarly in synthetic and real data. Given the stochastic output of such detectors, candidates for object poses are sampled.The second objective is to automatically learn a single score for each pose candidate that represents its quality in terms of explaining the entire scene via a gradient boosted tree. The proposed method uses features derived from surface and boundary alignment between the observed scene and the object model placed at hypothesized poses. Scene-level, multi-instance pose estimation is then achieved by an integer linear programming process that selects hypotheses that maximize the sum of the learned individual scores, while respecting constraints, such as avoiding collisions. To evaluate this method, a dataset of densely packed objects with challenging setups for state-of-the-art approaches is collected. Experiments on this dataset and a public one show that the method significantly outperforms alternatives in terms of 6D pose accuracy while trained only with synthetic datasets.}

We propose Active Domain Randomization, a novel algorithm that learns a parameter sampling strategy. Our method looks for the most informative environment variations within the given randomization ranges by leveraging the discrepancies of policy rollouts in randomized and reference environment instances. We find that training more frequently on these instances leads to better overall agent generalization. Our experiments across various physics-based simulated and real-robot tasks show that this enhancement leads to more robust, consistent policies.}

In particular, we run experiments on two different tasks: peg-in-hole and lap-joint. In each case, we compare different replay buffer structures and how DER affects them. Our ablation studies show that Dynamic Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient that either largely shortens the training time in these challenging environments or solves the tasks that the vanilla Ape-X DDPG cannot solve.

Two fundamental limitations of these methods are that most require a full model of the environment to be known a priori, and they attempt to reason over a world representation that is flat and unnecessarily detailed, which limits scalability. Recent semantic mapping methods address partial observability by exploiting language as a sensor to infer a distribution over topological, metric and semantic properties of the environment. However, maintaining a distribution over highly detailed maps that can support grounding of diverse instructions is computationally expensive and hinders real-time human-robot collaboration. We propose a novel framework that learns to adapt perception according to the task in order to maintain compact distributions over semantic maps. Experiments with a mobile manipulator demonstrate more efficient instruction following in a priori unknown environments.}

Our method can either leverage a known parameterization or incrementally grow a parameterization while remaining consistent with the data, and we provide theoretical guarantees on the conservativeness of the recovered unsafe set.

  abstract = 	 {In many settings, it is desirable to learn decision-making and control policies through learning or bootstrapping from expert demonstrations. The most common approaches under this Imitation Learning (IL) framework are Behavioural Cloning (BC), and Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL). Recent methods for IRL have demonstrated the capacity to learn effective policies with access to a very limited set of demonstrations, a scenario in which BC methods often fail. Unfortunately, due to multiple factors of variation, directly comparing these methods does not provide adequate intuition for understanding this difference in performance. In this work, we present a unified probabilistic perspective on IL algorithms based on divergence minimization. We present f-MAX, an f-divergence generalization of AIRL [1], a state-of-the-art IRL method. f-MAX enables us to relate prior IRL methods such as GAIL [2] and AIRL [1], and understand their algorithmic properties. Through the lens of divergence minimization we tease apart the differences between BC and successful IRL approaches,and empirically evaluate these nuances on simulated high-dimensional continuous control domains. Our findings conclusively identify that IRLâs state-marginal matching objective contributes most to its superior performance. Lastly, we apply our new understanding of IL method to the problem of state-marginal matching, where we demonstrate that in simulated arm pushing environments we can teach agents a diverse range of behaviours using simply hand-specified state distributions and no reward functions or expert demonstrations.

By interleaving episodic exploration with Bayesian nonlinear system identification, our algorithm takes advantage of the inductive bias to explore in a directed manner, without assuming prior knowledge of the MDP. Empirical evaluations indicate a clear advantage of the proposed algorithm in terms of the rate of convergence and the final model fidelity when compared to intrinsic-motivation-based algorithms employing exploration bonuses such as prediction error and information gain.

We demonstrate that our approach enables a MOVO robot to view an object with its RGB-D sensor, estimate its motion model, and use that estimate to interact with the object.}

  abstract = 	 {ROBEL is an open-source platform of cost-effective robots designed for reinforcement learning in the real world. ROBEL introduces two robots, each aimed to accelerate reinforcement learning research in different task domains: DâClaw is a three-fingered hand robot that facilitates learning dexterous manipulation tasks, and DâKitty is a four-legged robot that facilitates learning agile legged locomotion tasks. These low-cost, modular robots are easy to maintain and are robust enough to sustain on-hardware reinforcement learning from scratch with over 14000 training hours registered on them to date. To leverage this platform, we propose an extensible set of continuous control benchmark tasks for each robot. These tasks feature dense and sparse task objectives, and additionally introduce score metrics for hardware-safety. We provide benchmark scores on an initial set of tasks using a variety of learning-based methods. Furthermore, we show that these results can be replicated across copies of the robots located in different institutions. Code, documentation, design files, detailed assembly instructions, trained policies, baseline details, task videos, and all supplementary materials required to reproduce the results are available at www.roboticsbenchmarks.org.}

This work introduces SEVN, a sidewalk simulation environment and a neural network-based approach to creating a navigation agent. SEVN contains panoramic images with labels for house numbers, doors, and street name signs, and formulations for several navigation tasks. We study the performance of an RL algorithm (PPO) in this setting. Our policy model fuses multi-modal observations in the form of variable resolution images, visible text, and simulated GPS data to navigate to a goal door. We hope that this dataset, simulator, and experimental results will provide a foundation for further research into the creation of agents that can assist members of the BVI community with outdoor navigation.}

Small perturbations to sensor inputs (from noise or adversarial examples) are often enough to change network-based decisions, which was already shown to cause an autonomous vehicle to swerve into oncoming traffic. In light of these dangers, numerous algorithms have been developed as defensive mechanisms from these adversarial inputs, some of which provide formal robustness guarantees or certificates. This work leverages research on certified adversarial robustness to develop an online certified defense for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed defense computes guaranteed lower bounds on state-action values during execution to identify and choose the optimal action under a worst-case deviation in input space due to possible adversaries or noise. The approach is demonstrated on a Deep Q-Network policy and is shown to increase robustness to noise and adversaries in pedestrian collision avoidance scenarios and a classic control task.}

State-of-the-art algorithms are now able to match the asymptotic performance of model-free methods while being significantly more data efficient. However, this success has come at a price: state-of-the-art model-based methods require significant computation interleaved with data collection, resulting in run times that take days, even if the amount of agent interaction might be just hours or even minutes. When considering the goal of learning in real-time on real robots, this means these state-of-the-art model-based algorithms still remain impractical. In this work, we propose an asynchronous framework for model-based reinforcement learning methods that brings down the run time of these algorithms to be just the data collection time. We evaluate our asynchronous framework on a range of standard MuJoCo benchmarks. We also evaluate our asynchronous framework on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks. We show how asynchronous learning not only speeds up learning w.r.t wall-clock time through parallelization, but also further reduces the sample complexity of model-based approaches by means of improving the exploration and by means of effectively avoiding the policy overfitting to the deficiencies of learned dynamics models.}

  abstract = 	 {On the quest for building autonomous robots, several robot learning frameworks with different functionalities have recently been developed. Yet, frameworks that combine diverse learning paradigms (such as imitation and reinforcement learning) into a common place are scarce. Existing ones tend to be robot-specific, and often require time-consuming work to be used with other robots. Also, their architecture is often weakly structured, mainly because of a lack of modularity and flexibility. This leads users to reimplement several pieces of code to integrate them into their own experimental or benchmarking work. To overcome these issues, we introduce PyRoboLearn, a new Python robot learning framework that combines different learning paradigms into a single framework. Our framework provides a plethora of robotic environments, learning models and algorithms. PyRoboLearn is developed with a particular focus on modularity, flexibility, generality, and simplicity to favor (re)usability. This is achieved by abstracting each key concept, undertaking a modular programming approach, minimizing the coupling among the different modules, and favoring composition over inheritance for better flexibility. We demonstrate the different features and utility of our framework through different use cases.}

In this work, an online learning scheme for control based on FL is presented. By reading joint positions and joint velocities information only (without the use of any torque measurement), we are able to learn those model uncertainties and thus achieve perfect FL control. Simulations results on the popular KUKA LWR iiwa robot are reported to show the quality of the proposed approach.}

We take a step in this direction by tackling the problem of segmenting unseen object instances in tabletop environments. However, the type of large-scale real-world dataset required for this task typically does not exist for most robotic settings, which motivates the use of synthetic data. We propose a novel method that separately leverages synthetic RGB and synthetic depth for unseen object instance segmentation. Our method is comprised of two stages where the first stage operates only on depth to produce rough initial masks, and the second stage refines these masks with RGB. Surprisingly, our framework is able to learn from synthetic RGB-D data where the RGB is non-photorealistic. To train our method, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of random objects on tabletops. We show that our method, trained on this dataset, can produce sharp and accurate masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on unseen object instance segmentation. We also show that our method can segment unseen objects for robot grasping. Code, models and video can be found at the project website1.}

  abstract = 	 {Policy gradient methods have demonstrated success in reinforcement learning tasks with high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces. But they are also notoriously sample inefficient, which can be attributed, at least in part, to the high variance in estimating the gradient of the task objective with Monte Carlo methods. Previous research has endeavored to contend with this problem by studying control variates (CVs) that can reduce the variance of estimates without introducing bias, including the early use of baselines, state dependent CVs, and the more recent state-action dependent CVs. In this work, we analyze the properties and drawbacks of previous CV techniques and, surprisingly, we find that these works have overlooked an important fact that Monte Carlo gradient estimates are generated by trajectories of states and actions. We show that ignoring the correlation across the trajectories can result in suboptimal variance reduction, and we propose a simple fix: a class of trajectory-wise CVs, that can further drive down the variance. The trajectory-wise CVs can be computed recursively and require only learning state-action value functions like the previous CVs for policy gradient. We further prove that the proposed trajectory-wise CVs are optimal for variance reduction under reasonable assumptions.}

In this work, we propose to predict and classify tactile signal using deep learning methods, seeking to enhance the adaptability of the robotic grasp system to external event changes that may lead to grasping failure. We develop a deep learning framework and collect 6650 tactile image sequences with a vision-based tactile sensor, and the neural network is integrated into a contact-event-based robotic grasping system. In grasping experiments, we achieved 52% increase in terms of object lifting success rate with contact detection, significantly higher robustness under unexpected loads with slip prediction compared with open-loop grasps, demonstrating that integration of the proposed framework into robotic grasping system substantially improves picking success rate and capability to withstand external disturbances.}

KTMs leverage the expressiveness of kernels from non-parametric modelling by projecting input trajectories onto a set of representative trajectories, to condition on a sequence of observed waypoint coordinates, and predict a multi-modal distribution over possible future trajectories. The output is a mixture of continuous stochastic processes, where each realisation is a continuous functional trajectory, which can be queried at arbitrarily fine time steps.}
