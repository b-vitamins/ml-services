 abstract = {We introduce a novel technique, which we call online-to-confidence-set conversion. The technique allows us to construct highprobability confidence sets for linear prediction with correlated inputs given the predictions of any algorithm (e.g., online LASSO, exponentiated gradient algorithm, online least-squares, p-norm algorithm) targeting online learning with linear predictors and the quadratic loss. By construction, the size of the confidence set is directly governed by the regret of the online learning algorithm. Constructing tight confidence sets is interesting on its own, but the new technique is given extra weight by the fact having access tight confidence sets underlies a number of important problems. The advantage of our construction here is that progress in constructing better algorithms for online prediction problems directly translates into tighter confidence sets. In this paper, this is demonstrated in the case of linear stochastic bandits. In particular, we introduce the sparse variant of linear stochastic bandits and show that a recent online algorithm together with our online-to-confidence-set conversion allows one to derive algorithms that can exploit if the reward is a function of a sparse linear combination of the components of the chosen action.

 abstract = {We describe a simple and efficient approach to learning structures of sparse high-dimensional latent variable models. Standard algorithms either learn structures of specific predefined forms, or estimate sparse graphs in the data space ignoring the possibility of the latent variables. In contrast, our method learns rich dependencies and allows for latent variables that may confound the relations between the observations. We extend the model to conditional mixtures with side information and non-Gaussian marginal distributions of the observations. We then show that our model may be used for learning sparse latent variable structures corresponding to multiple unknown states, and for uncovering features useful for explaining and predicting structural changes. We apply the model to real-world financial data with heavy-tailed marginals covering the lowand highmarket volatility periods of 2005-2011. We show that our method tends to give rise to significantly higher likelihoods of test data than standard network learning methods exploiting the sparsity assumption. We also demonstrate that our approach may be practical for financial stress-testing and visualization of dependencies between financial instruments.},

 abstract = {Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement learning problem where the learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action and receives a reward based on the action and context. We consider this problem under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and context. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new algorithm—Regressor Elimination— with a regret similar to the agnostic setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower bound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that for any set of policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards (given context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the previous approaches.},

Sparsity in high-dimensional matrix factorizations and principal components has been well-studied exhibiting many benefits; less attention has been given to sparsity in tensor decompositions. We propose two novel tensor decompositions that incorporate sparsity: the Sparse Higher-Order SVD and the Sparse CP Decomposition. The latter solves an `1-norm penalized relaxation of the single-factor CP optimization problem, thereby automatically selecting relevant features for each tensor factor. Through experiments and a scientific data analysis example, we demonstrate the utility of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, signal recovery, and exploratory data analysis of high-dimensional tensors.},

Unfortunately, the estimation of these maps from a finite sample is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Motivated by other machine learning models for which the existence of structure in the underlying distribution of data can reduce the complexity of estimation, we study and show how the factorization of the underlying distribution into independent subspaces can help us to estimate diffusion maps more accurately. Building upon this result, we propose and develop an algorithm that can automatically factorize a high dimensional data space in order to minimize the error of estimation of its diffusion map, even in the case when the underlying distribution is not decomposable. Experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved estimation performance of our method over the standard diffusion-map framework.},

By making use of several processors running in parallel, the archipelagos algorithm uses exponentially less memory compared to basic forward-backward message passing algorithms (O(log T ) compared to O(T ) on sequences of length T ) and, under oftensatisfied assumptions on the relative speed of passing forward and backward messages, runs no slower. We also describe a simple variant of the algorithm that achieves a factor of two speedup over forward-backward on a single core. Experiments with our implementation of archipelagos for the computation of posterior marginal probabilities in an HMM validate the space/time complexity analysis: using four cores, the required memory on our test problem was reduced from 8 GB to 319 KB (a factor of 25000) relative to forwardbackward, but completed in essentially the same time. The archipelagos algorithm applies to any dynamic graphical model, including dynamic Bayesian networks, conditional random fields, and hidden conditional random fields.},

The homology groups of a manifold are important topological invariants that provide an algebraic summary of the manifold. These groups contain rich topological information, for instance, about the connected components, holes, tunnels and sometimes the dimension of the manifold. In this paper, we consider the statistical problem of estimating the homology of a manifold from noisy samples under several dierent noise models. We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk for this problem. Our upper bounds are based on estimators which are constructed from a union of balls of appropriate radius around carefully selected points. In each case we establish complementary lower bounds using Le Cam’s lemma.},

 abstract = {Patient-specific algorithms to detect adverse clinical events during long-term physiological monitoring substantially improve performance relative to patient-nonspecific ones. However, these algorithms often rely on the availability of expert hand-labeled data for training, which severely restricts the scalability of personalized monitoring within a real-world setting. While active learning offers a natural framework to address this issue, the relative merits of dierent active learning methodologies have not been extensively studied in the setting of developing clinically useful detectors for infrequent time-series events. In this paper, we identify a core set of principles that are relative to the specific goal of personalized long-term physiological monitoring. We describe and compare dierent approaches for initialization, batch selection and termination within the active learning process. We position this work in the context of epileptic seizure onset detection. When evaluated on a database of scalp EEG recordings from 23 epileptic patients, we show that a combined distanceand diversity-based measure to determine the data to be queried, max-min clustering for identification of the initialization set, and a comparison of consecutive support vector sets to guide termination results in an active learning-based detector that can achieve similar performance to a patient-specific detector while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer labeled examples for training.},

It extends the well known methods of Lasso and Group Lasso by incorporating additional constraints on the variables as part of a convex optimization problem. This framework provides a straightforward way of favouring prescribed sparsity patterns, such as orderings, contiguous regions and overlapping groups, among others. Available optimization methods are limited to specific constraint sets and tend to not scale well with sample size and dimensionality. We propose a first order proximal method, which builds upon results on fixed points and successive approximations. The algorithm can be applied to a general class of conic and norm constraints sets and relies on a proximity operator subproblem which can be computed numerically. Experiments on different regression problems demonstrate state-of-the-art statistical performance, which improves over Lasso, Group Lasso and StructOMP. They also demonstrate the efficiency of the optimization algorithm and its scalability with the size of the problem.},

 abstract = {We propose a novel adaptive MCMC algorithm named AMOR (Adaptive Metropolis with Online Relabeling) for efficiently simulating from permutation-invariant targets occurring in, for example, Bayesian analysis of mixture models. An important feature of the algorithm is to tie the adaptation of the proposal distribution to the choice of a particular restriction of the target to a domain where label switching cannot occur. The algorithm relies on a stochastic approximation procedure for which we exhibit a Lyapunov function that formally defines the criterion used for selecting the relabeling rule. This criterion reveals an interesting connection with the problem of optimal quantifier design in vector quantization which was only implicit in previous works on the label switching problem. In benchmark examples, the algorithm turns out to be fastconverging and efficient at selecting meaningful non-trivial relabeling rules to allow accurate parameter inference.},

Also, they comprise only viral strain(s) that can be detected in the patients’ blood serum. The approach presented in this paper tackles these issues by considering not only the most recent therapies but also the different treatment backgrounds of the samples making up the clinical data sets when predicting the outcomes of HIV therapies. For this purpose, we introduce a similarity measure for sequences of therapies and use it for training separate linear models for predicting therapy outcome for each target sample. Compared to the most commonly used approach that encodes all available treatment information only by specific input features our approach has the advantage of delivering significantly more accurate predictions for therapy-experienced patients and for rare therapies. Additionally, the sample-specific models are more interpretable which is very important in medical applications.},

We propose a method that learns to assign MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70,000 words mapped to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning from raw text. The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data. Hence, the system ends up providing methods for knowledge acquisition and wordsense disambiguation within the context of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework.

Several such parameterizations of models for binary data are known, including the Ising, generalized Ising, canonical and full parameterizations. We also discuss a parameterization that we call the “spectral parameterization”, which has received significantly less coverage in existing literature. We provide this parameterization with a spectral interpretation by casting loglinear models in terms of orthogonal WalshHadamard harmonic expansions. Using various standard and group sparse regularizers for structural learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of these parameterizations. We show that the spectral parameterization, along with the canonical, has the best performance and sparsity levels, while the spectral does not depend on any particular reference state. The spectral interpretation also provides a new starting point for analyzing the statistics of binary data sets; we measure the magnitude of higher order interactions in the underlying distributions for several data sets.},

 abstract = {The reinforcement learning community has recently intensified its interest in online planning methods, due to their relative independence on the state space size. However, tight near-optimality guarantees are not yet available for the general case of stochastic Markov decision processes and closed-loop, state-dependent planning policies. We therefore consider an algorithm related to AO* that optimistically explores a tree representation of the space of closed-loop policies, and we analyze the near-optimality of the action it returns after n tree node expansions. While this optimistic planning requires a finite number of actions and possible next states for each transition, its asymptotic performance does not depend directly on these numbers, but only on the subset of nodes that significantly impact near-optimal policies. We characterize this set by introducing a novel measure of problem complexity, called the near-optimality exponent. Specializing the exponent and performance bound for some interesting classes of MDPs illustrates the algorithm works better when there are fewer near-optimal policies and less uniform transition probabilities.},

In such cases, it is in general impossible to derive sub-linear regret bounds since usual linear bandit algorithms have a regret in O(K p n). In this paper we assume that is S sparse, i.e. has at most S non-zero components, and that the space of arms is the unit ball for the jj:jj2 norm. We combine ideas from Compressed Sensing and Bandit Theory and derive an algorithm with a regret bound in O(S p n).

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose to apply sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse CCA) to an important genome-wide association study problem, eQTL mapping. Existing sparse CCA models do not incorporate structural information among variables such as pathways of genes. This work extends the sparse CCA so that it could exploit either the pre-given or unknown group structure via the structured-sparsity-inducing penalty. Such structured penalty poses new challenge on optimization techniques. To address this challenge, by specializing the excessive gap framework, we develop a scalable primal-dual optimization algorithm with a fast rate of convergence. Empirical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured sparse CCA on both simulated and genetic datasets.},

Here, the operational cost during test-time has to be taken into account when an algorithm is designed. This operational cost is affected by the average running time and the computation time required for feature extraction. When a diverse set of features is used, the latter can vary drastically. In this paper we propose an algorithm that constructs a cascade of classifiers which explicitly trades-off operational cost and classifier accuracy while accounting for on-demand feature extraction costs. Different from previous work, our algorithm reoptimizes trained classifiers and allows expensive features to be scheduled at any stage within the cascade to minimize overall cost. Experiments on actual web-search ranking data sets demonstrate that our framework leads to drastic test-time improvements.},

Such task structures can be exploited by incorporating hierarchical policies that consist of gating networks and sub-policies. However, this concept has only been partially explored for real world settings and complete methods, derived from first principles, are needed. Real world settings are challenging due to large and continuous state-action spaces that are prohibitive for exhaustive sampling methods. We define the problem of learning sub-policies in continuous state action spaces as finding a hierarchical policy that is composed of a high-level gating policy to select the low-level sub-policies for execution by the agent. In order to efficiently share experience with all sub-policies, also called inter-policy learning, we treat these sub-policies as latent variables which allows for distribution of the update information between the sub-policies. We present three different variants of our algorithm, designed to be suitable for a wide variety of real world robot learning tasks and evaluate our algorithms in two real robot learning scenarios as well as several simulations and comparisons.},

This allows us to perform structure learning while bypassing costly parameter estimation as well as explicit computation of the log-likelihood function.

A key issue is to avoid inconsistent estimators due to confounding by measured or unmeasured covariates, a problem commonly solved by ‘adjusting for’ a subset of the observed variables. When the data generating process can be represented by a directed acyclic graph, and this graph structure is known, there exist simple graphical procedures for determining which subset of covariates should be adjusted for to obtain consistent estimators of the causal effects. However, when the graph is not known no general and complete procedures for this task are available. In this paper we introduce such a method for linear non-Gaussian models, requiring only partial knowledge about the temporal ordering of the variables: We provide a simple statistical test for inferring whether an estimator of a causal eect is consistent when controlling for a subset of measured covariates, and we present heuristics to search for such a set. We show empirically that this statistical test identifies consistent vs inconsistent estimates, and that the search =},

While several research efforts have been focusing on parametric approaches (such as Gaussian models), kernel-based estimators are still the only viable and well-understood option for nonparametric density estimation. This paper develops a semiparametric estimator of probability density functions based on the nonparanormal transformation, which has been recently proposed for mapping arbitrarily distributed data samples onto normally distributed datasets. Pointwise and uniform consistency properties are established for the developed method. The resulting density model is then applied to pseudo-likelihood estimation in Markov random fields. An experimental evaluation on data distributed according to a variety of density functions indicates that such semiparametric Markov random field models significantly outperform both their Gaussian and kernel-based alternatives in terms of prediction accuracy.},

Our main analysis tool is Ergodic theory, which allows learning potentially useful quantities from the system without building a model. Our main contribution is three-fold. First, we present several dynamical systems that demonstrate the difficulty of learning in the general case, without making additional assumptions. We state the necessary condition that the underlying system must satisfy to be amenable for learning. Second, we discuss the relationship between this condition and state-ofthe-art predictive representations, and we show that there are systems that satisfy the above condition but cannot be modeled by such representations.

The underlying assumption is that the parameters associated with time series segments delimited by multiple changepoints are a priori independent. Under weak regularity conditions, the parameters can be integrated out in the likelihood, leading to a closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood. However, the assumption of prior independence is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where the segment-specific regulatory relationships among the interdependent quantities tend to undergo gradual evolutionary adaptations. We therefore propose a Bayesian coupling scheme to introduce systematic information sharing among the segment-specific interaction parameters. We investigate the effect this model improvement has on the network reconstruction accuracy in a reverse engineering context, where the objective is to learn the structure of a gene regulatory network from temporal gene expression profiles.},

The approach relies on the Locality Preserving Criterion, which preserves the locality of the data points. However, LPI takes every word in a data corpus into account, even though many words may not be useful for document clustering. To overcome this problem, we propose an approach called Locality Preserving Feature Learning (LPFL), which incorporates feature selection into LPI. Specifically, we aim to find a subset of features, and learn a linear transformation to optimize the Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer programming problem, which we relax into a constrained Frobenius norm minimization problem, and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction Method (ADM). ADM, which iteratively updates the linear transformation matrix, the residue matrix and the Lagrangian multiplier, is theoretically guaranteed to converge at the rate O( 1 t ). Experiments on benchmark document datasets show that our proposed method outperforms LPI, as well as other state-of-the-art document analysis approaches.},

Thermodynamic integration is a popular method to estimate the marginal likelihood by using samples from annealed posteriors. Here we show that there exists a robust and flexible alternative. The new method estimates the density of states, which counts the number of states associated with a particular value of the likelihood. If the density of states is known, computation of the marginal likelihood reduces to a onedimensional integral. We outline a maximum likelihood procedure to estimate the density of states from annealed posterior samples. We apply our method to various likelihoods and show that it is superior to thermodynamic integration in that it is more flexible with regard to the annealing schedule and the family of bridging distributions.

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Maximum Margin Temporal Clustering (MMTC). MMTC simultaneously determines the start and the end of each segment, while learning a multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) to discriminate among temporal clusters. MMTC extends Maximum Margin Clustering in two ways: first, it incorporates the notion of TC, and second, it introduces additional constraints to achieve better balance between clusters.

We study the stochastic bandit problem where each arm has a reward distribution supported in [0, 1]. For this model, there exists a policy which achieves the theoretical bound asymptotically. However the optimal policy requires a computation of a convex optimization which involves the empirical distribution of each arm. In this paper, we propose a policy which exploits the first d empirical moments for arbitrary d fixed in advance. We show that the performance of the policy approaches the theoretical bound as d increases. This policy can be implemented by solving polynomial equations and we derive the explicit solution for d smaller than 5. By choosing appropriate d, the proposed policy realizes a tradeoff between the computational complexity and the expected regret.},

Real-world relational data often include a large portion of non-informative pairwise data entries. Many existing stochastic blockmodels suffer from these irrelevant data entries because of their rather simpler forms of priors. The proposed model incorporates a latent variable that explicitly indicates whether each data entry is relevant or not to diminish bad effects associated with such irrelevant data. Through experiments using synthetic and real data sets, we show that the proposed model can extract clusters with stronger relations among data within the cluster than clusters obtained by the conventional model.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of active learning over the vertices in a graph, without feature representation. Our study is based on the common graph smoothness assumption, which is formulated in a Gaussian random field model. We analyze the probability distribution over the unlabeled vertices conditioned on the label information, which is a multivariate normal with the mean being the harmonic solution over the field. Then we select the nodes to label such that the total variance of the distribution on the unlabeled data, as well as the expected prediction error, is minimized. In this way, the classifier we obtain is theoretically more robust. Compared with existing methods, our algorithm has the advantage of selecting data in a batch offline mode with solid theoretical support. We show improved performance over existing label selection criteria on several real world data sets.},

 abstract = {In this paper we consider the task of estimating the non-zero pattern of the sparse inverse covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian random vector from a set of iid samples. Note that this is also equivalent to recovering the underlying graph structure of a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF). We present two novel greedy approaches to solving this problem. The first estimates the non-zero covariates of the overall inverse covariance matrix using a series of global forward and backward greedy steps. The second estimates the neighborhood of each node in the graph separately, again using greedy forward and backward steps, and combines the intermediate neighborhoods to form an overall estimate. The principal contribution of this paper is a rigorous analysis of the sparsistency, or consistency in recovering the sparsity pattern of the inverse covariance matrix. Surprisingly, we show that both the local and global greedy methods learn the full structure of the model with high probability given just $O(d\log(p))$ samples, which is a \emph{significant} improvement over state of the art $\ell_1$-regularized Gaussian MLE (Graphical Lasso) that requires $O(d^2\log(p))$ samples. Moreover, the restricted eigenvalue and smoothness conditions imposed by our greedy methods are much weaker than the strong irrepresentable conditions required by the $\ell_1$-regularization based methods. We corroborate our results with extensive simulations and examples, comparing our local and global greedy methods to the $\ell_1$-regularized Gaussian MLE as well as the Neighborhood Greedy method to that of nodewise $\ell_1$-regularized linear regression (Neighborhood Lasso).},

We show in this paper that methods derived from this second perspective prove optimal when evaluated using the frequentist cumulated regret as a measure of performance. We give a general formulation for a class of Bayesian index policies that rely on quantiles of the posterior distribution. For binary bandits, we prove that the corresponding algorithm, termed Bayes-UCB, satisfies finite-time regret bounds that imply its asymptotic optimality. More generally, Bayes-UCB appears as an unifying framework for several variants of the UCB algorithm addressing different bandit problems (parametric multi-armed bandits, Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance, linear bandits). But the generality of the Bayesian approach makes it possible to address more challenging models. In particular, we show how to handle linear bandits with sparsity constraints by resorting to Gibbs sampling.},

 abstract = {Bayesian model averaging linearly mixes the probabilistic predictions of multiple models, each weighted by its posterior probability. This is the coherent Bayesian way of combining multiple models only under certain restrictive assumptions, which we outline. We explore a general framework for Bayesian model combination (which differs from model averaging) in the context of classification. This framework explicitly models the relationship between each model’s output and the unknown true label. The framework does not require that the models be probabilistic (they can even be human assessors), that they share prior information or receive the same training data, or that they be independent in their errors. Finally, the Bayesian combiner does not need to believe any of the models is in fact correct. We test several variants of this classifier combination procedure starting from a classic statistical model proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979) and using MCMC to add more complex but important features to the model. Comparisons on several data sets to simpler methods like majority voting show that the Bayesian methods not only perform well but result in interpretable diagnostics on the data points and the models.},

Convex optimization procedures that arise from relaxing the NP-hard subset selection procedure, e.g., the Lasso or Dantzig selector, have become the focus of intense theoretical investigations. Although many efficient algorithms exist that solve these problems, finding a solution when the number of variables is large, e.g., several hundreds of thousands in problems arising in genome-wide association analysis, is still computationally challenging. A practical solution for these high-dimensional problems is marginal regression, where the output is regressed on each variable separately. We investigate theoretical properties of marginal regression in a multitask framework. Our contribution include: i) sharp analysis for marginal regression in a single task setting with random design, ii) sufficient conditions for the multitask screening to select the relevant variables, iii) a lower bound on the Hamming distance convergence for multitask variable selection problems. A simulation study further demonstrates the performance of marginal regression.},

 abstract = {We present a minimax framework for classification that considers stochastic adversarial perturbations to the training data. We show that for binary classification it is equivalent to SVM, but with a very natural interpretation of regularization parameter. In the multiclass case, we obtain that our formulation is equivalent to regularizing the hinge loss with the maximum norm of the weight vector (i.e., the two-infinity norm). We test this new regularization scheme and show that it is competitive with the Frobenius regularization commonly used for multiclass SVM. We proceed to analyze various forms of stochastic perturbations and obtain compact optimization problems for the optimal classifiers. Taken together, our results illustrate the advantage of using stochastic perturbations rather than deterministic ones, as well as oer a simple geometric interpretation for SVM optimization.},

 abstract = {The maximization of the data likelihood under a given probabilistic generative model is the essential goal of many algorithms for unsupervised learning. If expectation maximization is used for optimization, a lower bound on the data likelihood, the free-energy, is optimized. The parameter-dependent part of the free-energy (the difference between free-energy and posterior entropy) is the essential entity in the derivation of learning algorithms. Here we show that for many common generative models the optimal values of the parameter-dependent part can be derived in closed-form. These closed-form expressions are hereby given as sums of the negative (differential) entropies of the individual model distributions. We apply our theoretical results to derive such closed-form expressions for a number of common and recent models, including probabilistic PCA, factor analysis, different versions of sparse coding, and Linear Dynamical Systems. The main contribution of this work is theoretical but we show how the derived results can be used to efficiently compute free-energies, and how they can be used for consistency checks of learning algorithms.},

Our model uses a sum of separable, compactly supported covariance functions, which yields a full covariance matrix represented in terms of small sparse matrices operating either on the spatial or temporal domain. The proposed inference procedure is based on Gibbs sampling, in which samples from the conditional distribution of the latent function values are obtained by applying a simple linear transformation to samples drawn from the joint distribution of the function values and the observations. We make use of the proposed model structure and the conjugate gradient method to compute the required transformation. In the experimental part, the proposed algorithm is compared to the standard approach using the sparse Cholesky decomposition and it is shown to be much faster and computationally feasible for 100–1000 times larger datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in the problem of reconstructing sea surface temperature, which requires processing of a real-world dataset with 10 6 observations.},

 abstract = {In human movement learning, it is most common to teach constituent elements of complex movements in isolation, before chaining them into complex movements. Segmentation and recognition of observed movement could thus proceed out of this existing knowledge, which is directly compatible with movement generation. In this paper, we address exactly this scenario. We assume that a library of movement primitives has already been taught, and we wish to identify elements of the library in a complex motor act, where the individual elements have been smoothed together, and, occasionally, there might be a movement segment that is not in our library yet. We employ a flexible machine learning representation of movement primitives based on learnable nonlinear attractor system. For the purpose of movement segmentation and recognition, it is possible to reformulate this representation as a controlled linear dynamical system. An Expectation-Maximization algorithm can be developed to estimate the open parameters of a movement primitive from the library, using as input an observed trajectory piece. If no matching primitive from the library can be found, a new primitive is created. This process allows a straightforward sequential segmentation of observed movement into known and new primitives, which are suitable for robot imitation learning. We illustrate our approach with synthetic examples and data collected from human movement.},

Most useful graph partitioning criteria correspond to optimizing a ratio between the cut and the size of the partitions, this ratio leads to an NP-hard problem that is only solved approximately. This makes it difficult to know whether failures of the algorithm are due to failures of the optimization or to the criterion being optimized. In this paper we present a framework that seeks and finds the optimal solution of several NP-hard graph partitioning problems. We use a classical approach to ratio problems where we repeatedly ask whether the optimal solution is greater than or less than some constant - . Our main insight is the equivalence between this “ question” and performing inference in a graphical model with many local potentials and one high-order potential. We show that this specific form of the highorder potential is amenable to message-passing algorithms and how to obtain a bound on the optimal solution from the messages. Our experiments show that in many cases our approach yields the global optimum and improves the popular spectral solution.},

Given an input, an M3E model predicts the output with the smallest corresponding Renyi entropy of generalized distribution. This is equivalent to minimizing a score that consists of two terms: (i) the negative log-likelihood of the output, ensuring that the output has a high probability; and (ii) a measure of uncertainty over the distribution of the hidden variables conditioned on the input and the output, ensuring that there is little confusion in the values of the hidden variables. Given a training dataset, the parameters of an M3E model are learned by maximizing the margin between the Renyi entropies of the ground-truth output and all other incorrect outputs. Training an M3E can be viewed as minimizing an upper bound on a user-defined loss, and includes, as a special case, the latent support vector machine framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of M3E models on two standard machine learning applications, discriminative motif finding and image classification, using publicly available datasets.},

 abstract = {We consider online learning in a special class of episodic Markovian decision processes, namely, loop-free stochastic shortest path problems. In this problem, an agent has to traverse through a finite directed acyclic graph with random transitions while maximizing the obtained rewards along the way. We assume that the reward function can change arbitrarily between consecutive episodes, and is entirely revealed to the agent at the end of each episode. Previous work was concerned with the case when the stochastic dynamics is known ahead of time, whereas the main novelty of this paper is that this assumption is lifted. We propose an algorithm called “follow the perturbed optimistic policy” that combines ideas from the “follow the perturbed leader” method for online learning of arbitrary sequences and “upper confidence reinforcement learning”, an algorithm for regret minimization in Markovian decision processes (with a fixed reward function). We prove that the expected cumulative regret of our algorithm is of order L|X||A| p T up to logarithmic factors, where L is the length of the longest path in the graph,X is the state space, A is the action space and T is the number of episodes. To our knowledge this is the first algorithm that learns and controls stochastic and adversarial components in an online fashion at the same time.},

Moreover, for high-dimensional data, dierent features may be relevant or irrelevant to each clustering solution, suggesting the need for feature selection in clustering. Features relevant to one clustering interpretation may be dierent from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation or view of the data. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and the feature subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our model, the features in dierent views may be shared and therefore the sets of relevant features are allowed to overlap. We model feature relevance to each view using an Indian Buet Process and the cluster membership in each view using a Chinese Restaurant Process. We provide an inference approach to learn the latent parameters corresponding to this multiple partitioning problem. Our model not only learns the features and clusters in each view but also automatically learns the number of clusters, number of views and number of features in each view.},

We also show that these bounds are tight for specific losses, thus they cannot be improved in general.

There are two main drawbacks with current speech analysis methods. First, a common design paradigm seems to build a special-purpose signal-processing front-end followed by (when appropriate) a back-end based on probabilistic models. A difficulty is that most features are nonlinear operators of the speech waveform, whose statistical behavior is hard to be modeled. Second, different tasks of speech analysis are carried out separately. These practices are admittedly useful but not optimal due to the incomplete use of available information. These examinations motivate us to directly model the spectrogram and to integrate together the three fundamental speech parameters - the pitch, energy and spectral envelope. We successfully devise such a model called probabilistic acoustic tube (PAT) model. The integration is performed in a principled manner with explicit physical meaning. We demonstrate the capability of PAT for a number of speech analysis/synthesis tasks, such as pitch tracking under both clean and additive noise conditions, speech synthesis, and phoneme clustering.},

 abstract = {Inference in probabilistic graphical models can be represented as a constrained optimization problem of a free-energy functional. Substantial research has been focused on the approximation of the constraint set, also known as the marginal polytope. This paper presents a novel inference algorithm that tightens and solves the optimization problem by intersecting the popular local polytope and the semidefinite outer bound of the marginal polytope. Using dual decomposition, our method separates the optimization problem into two subproblems: a semidefinite program (SDP), which is solved by a low-rank SDP algorithm, and a free-energy based optimization problem, which is solved by convex belief propagation. Our method has a very reasonable computational complexity and its actual running time is typically within a small factor ( 10) of convex belief propagation. Tested on both synthetic data and a real-world protein sidechain packing benchmark, our method significantly outperforms tree-reweighted belief propagation in both marginal probability inference and MAP inference. Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in MRF inference, solving all protein tasks solved by the recently presented MPLP method [19], and beating MPLP on lattices with strong edge potentials.},

The bound makes use of a subset of the variables, a feedback vertex set, which allows us to decompose the graph into tractable parts. Furthermore, a tightening strategy for the bound is presented, which finds the states of the feedback vertex set that maximally increase the bound, and clamps them.

 abstract = {Models such as pairwise conditional random fields (CRFs) are extremely popular in computer vision and various other machine learning disciplines. However, they have limited expressive power and often cannot represent the posterior distribution correctly. While learning the parameters of such models which have insufficient expressivity, researchers use loss functions to penalize certain misrepresentations of the solution space. Till now, researchers have used only simplistic loss functions such as the Hamming loss, to enable efficient inference. The paper shows how sophisticated and useful higher order loss functions can be incorporated in the learning process. These loss functions ensure that the MAP solution does not deviate much from the ground truth in terms of certain higher order statistics. We propose a learning algorithm which uses the recently proposed lowerenvelop representation of higher order functions to transform them to pairwise functions, which allow efficient inference. We test the efficacy of our method on the problem of foreground-background image segmentation. Experimental results show that the incorporation of higher order loss functions in the learning formulation using our method leads to much better results compared to those obtained by using the traditional Hamming loss.},

 abstract = {We present an algorithm for fast posterior inference in penalized high-dimensional state-space models, suitable in the case where a few measurements are taken in each time step. We assume that the state prior and observation likelihoods are log-concave and have a special structure that allows fast matrix-vector operations. We derive a second-order algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori state path estimate, where the cost per iteration scales linearly both in time and memory. This is done by computing an approximate Newton direction using an efficient forward-backward scheme based on a sequence of low rank updates. We formalize the conditions under which our algorithm is applicable and prove its stability and convergence. We show that the state vector can be drawn from a large class of prior distributions without affecting the linear complexity of our algorithm. This class includes both Gaussian and nonsmooth sparse and group sparse priors for which we employ an interior point modification of our algorithm. We discuss applications in text modeling and neuroscience.},

This transformation aims at separating the problems of learning the linear and nonlinear parts of the whole input-output mapping, which has many benefits. We study the theoretical properties of the transformation by noting that they make the Fisher information matrix closer to a diagonal matrix, and thus standard gradient closer to the natural gradient. We experimentally confirm the usefulness of the transformations by noting that they make basic stochastic gradient learning competitive with state-of-the-art learning algorithms in speed, and that they seem also to help find solutions that generalize better. The experiments include both classification of small images and learning a lowdimensional representation for images by using a deep unsupervised auto-encoder network. The transformations were beneficial in all cases, with and without regularization and with networks from two to five hidden layers.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of developing privacypreserving machine learning algorithms in a distributed multiparty setting. Here different parties own different parts of a data set, and the goal is to learn a classifier from the entire data set without any party revealing any information about the individual data points it owns. Pathak et al [7] recently proposed a solution to this problem in which each party learns a local classifier from its own data, and a third party then aggregates these classifiers in a privacy-preserving manner using a cryptographic scheme. The generalization performance of their algorithm is sensitive to the number of parties and the relative fractions of data owned by the different parties. In this paper, we describe a new differentially private algorithm for the multiparty setting that uses a stochastic gradient descent based procedure to directly optimize the overall multiparty objective rather than combining classifiers learned from optimizing local objectives. The algorithm achieves a slightly weaker form of differential privacy than that of [7], but provides improved generalization guarantees that do not depend on the number of parties or the relative sizes of the individual data sets. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.},

While this bound is extremely useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse, but also exhibit structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on group-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal coecients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are predefined, but the particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups (e.g., compositions, sizes, extents, overlaps, etc.). Experiments show that our result holds for a variety of overlapping group configurations.},

In many applications, joint learning of unrelated tasks which use the same input data can be beneficial. The reason is that prior knowledge about which tasks are unrelated can lead to sparser and more informative representations for each task, essentially screening out idiosyncrasies of the data distribution. We propose a novel method which builds on a prior multitask methodology by favoring a shared low dimensional representation within each group of tasks. In addition, we impose a penalty on tasks from different groups which encourages the two representations to be orthogonal. We further discuss a condition which ensures convexity of the optimization problem and argue that it can be solved by alternating minimization. We present experiments on synthetic and real data, which indicate that incorporating unrelated tasks can improve significantly over standard multi-task learning methods.},

This notion lends itself to an elegant characterization of optimal decision rules and in turn suggests corresponding empirical rules based on local nearest neighbor distances. We compute a single composite score for the entire spatio-temporal data sample based on the local neighborhood distances. We declare data samples as containing local anomalies based on the composite score. We show that such rules not only asymptotically guarantee desired false alarm control but are also asymptotically optimal. We also show that our composite scoring scheme overcomes the inherent resolution issues of alternative multi-comparison approaches that are based on fusing the outcomes of location-by-location comparisons.

Recently, variational Bayesian (VB) inference techniques have successfully been applied to such large scale bilinear models. However, current algorithms are of the alternate updating or stochastic gradient descent type, slow to converge and prone to getting stuck in shallow local minima. While for MAP or maximum margin estimation, singular value shrinkage algorithms have been proposed which can far outperform alternate updating, this methodological avenue remains unexplored for Bayesian techniques. In this paper, we show how to combine a recent singular value shrinkage characterization of fully observed spherical Gaussian VB matrix factorization with local variational bounding in order to obtain efficient VB inference for general MF models with non-conjugate likelihood potentials. In particular, we show how to handle Poisson and Bernoulli potentials, far more suited for most MF applications than Gaussian likelihoods. Our algorithm can be run even for very large models and is easily implemented in {\em Matlab}.

In this paper, we investigate sparsistency of fused lasso for general graph structures, i.e. its ability to correctly recover the exact support of piece-wise constant graphstructured patterns asymptotically (for largescale graphs). To emphasize this distinction over previous work, we will refer to it as Edge Lasso. We focus on the (structured) normal means setting, and our results provide necessary and sucient conditions on the graph properties as well as the signal-to-noise ratio needed to ensure sparsistency. We examplify our results using simple graph-structured patterns, and demonstrate that in some cases fused lasso is sparsistent at very weak signal-to-noise ratios (scaling as p (logn)=jAj, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and A is the smallest set of vertices with constant activation). In other cases, it performs no better than thresholding the dierence},

The Bethe approximation reduces the problem of computing the partition function in a graphical model to that of solving a set of non-linear equations, so-called the Bethe equation. On the other hand, the BP algorithm is a popular heuristic method for estimating marginal distribution in a graphical model. Although they are inspired and developed from dierent directions, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004) established a somewhat surprising connection: the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following important question to understand their limitations and empirical successes: the Bethe equation is computationally easy to solve? We present a message passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in polynomial number of bitwise operations for arbitrary binary graphical models of n nodes where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(logn). Our algorithm, an alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue, is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed point computation in such a large class of graphical models. Moreover, we believe that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in statistical physics.},

 abstract = {We consider the problem of learning a sparse regression model for predicting multiple related outputs given high-dimensional inputs, where related outputs are likely to share common relevant inputs. Most of the previous methods for learning structured sparsity assumed that the structure over the outputs is known a priori, and focused on designing regularization functions that encourage structured sparsity reflecting the given output structure. In this paper, we propose a new approach for sparse multiple-output regression that can jointly learn both the output structure and regression coecients with structured sparsity. Our approach reformulates the standard regression model into an alternative parameterization that leads to a conditional Gaussian graphical model, and employes an inverse-covariance regularization. We show that the orthant-wise quasi-Newton algorithm developed for L1regularized log-linear model can be adopted for a fast optimization for our method. We demonstrate our method on simulated datasets and real datasets from genetics and finances applications.},

Membership of a distribution to one of these classes is known to have implications which are important in reliability, queuing theory, game theory and other disciplines. Our proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance between an empirical cumulative hazard function and its best approximation from the class of distributions constituting the null hypothesis. It turns out that the least favorable distribution, which produces the largest probability of Type I error of each of the tests, is the exponential distribution. This fact is used to produce an appropriate cut-off or p-value. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to check small sample size (i.e., significance) and power of the test.

 abstract = {We propose two novel Branch-and-Bound (BB) methods to efficiently solve exact MAPMRF inference on problems with a large number of states (per variable) H. By organizing the data in a suitable structure, the time complexity of our best method for evaluating the bound at each branch is reduced from O(H) to O(H). This permits searching for the MAP solution in O(BH +Q) instead of O(BH) (without using the data structure), where B is the number of branches and Q is the one-time cost to build the data structure which is proportional to H. Our analysis on synthetic data shows that, given a limited time budget, our method solves problems that are characterized by a much larger number of states when compared to stateof-the-art exact inference algorithms (e.g., Marinescu and Dechter (2007); Sontag et al. (2008)) and other baseline BB methods. We further show that our method is well suited for computer vision and computational biology problems where the state space (per variable) is large. In particular, our approach is an order of magnitude faster on average than Sontag et al.’s Cluster Pursuit (CP) on human pose estimation problems. Moreover, given a time budget of up to 20 minutes, our method consistently solves more protein design problems than CP does. Finally, we successfully explore different branching strategies and ways to utilize domain knowledge of the problem to significantly reduce the empirical inference time.},

Opposite to all other methods which have been suggested for constrained spectral clustering, we can always guarantee to satisfy all constraints.

More specifically, they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once for each group, as opposed to once for each variable. The groups are defined by means of constraints, so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity of the constraint language. Existing approaches for exact lifted inference rely on (in)equality constraints. We show how inference methods can be generalized to work with arbitrary constraints. This allows them to capture a broader range of symmetries, leading to more opportunities for lifting. We empirically demonstrate that this improves inference eciency with orders of magnitude, allowing exact inference in cases where until now only approximate inference was feasible.},

 abstract = {Often when modeling structured domains, it is desirable to leverage information that is not naturally expressed as simply a label. Examples include knowledge about the evaluation measure that will be used at test time, and partial (weak) label information. When the additional information has structure that factorizes according to small subsets of variables (i.e., is low order, or decomposable), several approaches can be used to incorporate it into a learning procedure. Our focus in this work is the more challenging case, where the additional information does not factorize according to low order graphical model structure; we call this the high order case. We propose to formalize various forms of this additional information as high order loss functions, which may have complex interactions over large subsets of variables. We then address the computational challenges inherent in learning according to such loss functions, particularly focusing on the loss-augmented inference problem that arises in large margin learning; we show that learning with high order loss functions is often practical, giving strong empirical results, with one popular and several novel high-order loss functions, in several settings.},

A recurring difficulty in these models is the computation of the partition function, which may require an intractable sum. However, in many such models, the mode can be found efficiently even when the partition function is unavailable. Recent work on Perturb-and-MAP (PM) models (Papandreou and Yuille, 2011) has exploited this discrepancy to approximate the Gibbs distribution for Markov random fields (MRFs). Here, we explore a broader class of models, called Randomized Optimum models (RandOMs), which include PM as a special case. This new class of models encompasses not only MRFs, but also other models that have intractable partition functions yet permit efficient mode-finding, such as those based on bipartite matchings, shortest paths, or connected components in a graph. We develop likelihood-based learning algorithms for RandOMs, which, empirical results indicate, can produce better models than PM.},

As different radioactive materials have different effects to human body, it is important to know the types of nuclides and their levels of concentration from the recorded mixture of radiations to take necessary measures. We presently formulate a Bayesian generative model for the data available on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster across Japan. From the sparsely sampled measurements the model infers what nuclides are present as well as their concentration levels. An important property of the proposed model is that it admits unique recovery of the parameters. On synthetic data we demonstrate that our model is able to infer the underlying components and on data from the Fukushima Daiichi plant we establish that the model is able to account for the data. We further demonstrate how the model extends to include all the available measurements recorded throughout Japan. The model can be considered a first attempt to apply Bayesian learning unsupervised in order to give a more detailed account also of the latent structure present in the data of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.},

We consider learning when the learner has access to weakly labeled random samples and, on top of that, can actively query the correct labels of sample points of its choice. We propose a learning algorithm for this scenario, analyze its sample complexity and prove that, under certain conditions on the underlying data distribution, our learner can utilize the weak labels to reduce the number of expert labels it requires. We view this paper as a first step towards the development of a theory of learning from labels generated by teachers of varying accuracy, a scenario that is relevant in various practical applications.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we propose a second order optimization method to learn models where both the dimensionality of the parameter space and the number of training samples is high. In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace. As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data. In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix. We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter. The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace.},

A group may correspond to one view of the same set of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest. We show that by assuming groupwise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets, the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions in a Bayesian model providing the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces a hybrid model that combines a neural network with a latent topic model. The neural network provides a lowdimensional embedding for the input data, whose subsequent distribution is captured by the topic model. The neural network thus acts as a trainable feature extractor while the topic model captures the group structure of the data. Following an initial pretraining phase to separately initialize each part of the model, a unified training scheme is introduced that allows for discriminative training of the entire model. The approach is evaluated on visual data in scene classification task, where the hybrid model is shown to outperform models based solely on neural networks or topic models, as well as other baseline methods.},

 abstract = {When doing regression with inputs and outputs that are high-dimensional, it often makes sense to reduce the dimensionality of the inputs before mapping to the outputs. Much work in statistics and machine learning, such as reduced-rank regression, sliced inverse regression and their variants, has focused on linear dimensionality reduction, or on estimating the dimensionality reduction first and then the mapping. We propose a method where both the dimensionality reduction and the mapping can be nonlinear and are estimated jointly. Our key idea is to define an objective function where the low-dimensional coordinates are free parameters, in addition to the dimensionality reduction and the mapping. This has the effect of decoupling many groups of parameters from each other, affording a far more effective optimization than if using a deep network with nested mappings, and to use a good initialization from sliced inverse regression or spectral methods. Our experiments with image and robot applications show our approach to improve over direct regression and various existing approaches.},

 abstract = {Recently it has been shown that classical supervised and unsupervised training methods can be unified as special cases of so-called “optimal reverse prediction”: predicting inputs from target labels while optimizing over both model parameters and missing labels. Although this perspective establishes links between classical training principles, the existing formulation only applies to linear predictors under squared loss, hence is extremely limited. We generalize the formulation of optimal reverse prediction to arbitrary Bregman divergences, and more importantly to non-linear predictors. This extension is achieved by establishing a generalized form of forwardreverse minimization equivalence that holds for arbitrary matching losses. Several benefits follow. First, a new variant of Bregman divergence clustering can be recovered that incorporates a non-linear data reconstruction model. Second, normalized-cut and kernel-based extensions can be formulated coherently. Finally, a new semi-supervised training principle can be recovered for classification problems that demonstrates some advantages over the state of the art.},

In large-scale applications, the number of samples one can collect is typically of the same order of (or even less than) the dimensionality of the problem. This so-called high-dimensional statistical regime has been the object of intense recent research in machine learning and statistics, primarily due to phenomena inherent to this regime, such as the fact that the noise one sees here often dwarfs the magnitude of the signal itself. While relevant in numerous important operations research and engineering optimization applications, this setup falls far outside the traditional scope of robust and stochastic optimization. We propose three algorithms to address this setting, combining ideas from statistics, machine learning, and robust optimization. Our algorithms are motivated by three natural optimization objectives: minimizing the number of grossly violated constraints; maximizing the number of exactly satisfied constraints; and, finally, developing algorithms whose running time scales with the intrinsic dimension of a problem, as opposed to its observed dimension—a mismatch that, as we discuss in detail, can be dire in settings where constraints are meant to describe preferences of behaviors. The key ingredients of our algorithms are dimensionality reduction techniques from machine learning, robust optimization, and concentration of measure tools from statistics.},

A few approaches have been proposed to address this learning problem. In this setting active learning (AL), the problem of optimally selecting unlabeled samples for labeling, oers new challenges and has received little attention. In multiple annotator AL, it is not sucient to select a sample for labeling since, in addition, an optimal annotator must also be selected. This setting is of great interest as annotators’ expertise generally varies and could depend on the given sample itself; additionally, some annotators may be adversarial. Thus, clearly the information provided by some annotators should be more valuable than that provided by others and it could vary across data points. We propose an AL approach for this new scenario motivated by information theoretic principles. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the information that an annotator label provides about the true (but unknown) label of the data point. We develop this concept, propose an algorithm for active learning, and experimentally validate the proposed approach.},

The most natural way to deal with such multiple labels leads, unfortunately, to a nonconvex surrogate. In this paper, we propose a general class of perturbation-based surrogates that leverage the large margin approach, and are convex. We show that the standard hinge surrogate for classification actually falls within this class. We also find a surrogate within this class, for the ranking problem, that does not suer from the caveats mentioned above. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate that it performs better than other candidate large margin proposals on both synthetic and real world ranking datasets.},

In this paper, we generalize this method to the setup of sparse approximation over a pre-fixed dictionary. A fully corrective forward selection algorithm is proposed along with convergence analysis. The periteration computational overhead of the proposed algorithm is dominated by a subproblem of linear optimization over the dictionary and a subproblem to optimally adjust the aggregation weights. The former is cheaper in several applications than the Euclidean projection while the latter is typically an unconstrained optimization problem which is relatively easy to solve. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to the setting of non-negative/convex sparse approximation over a dictionary.

 abstract = {Linear classification has demonstrated success in many areas of applications. Modern algorithms for linear classification can train reasonably good models while going through the data in only tens of rounds. However, large data often does not fit in the memory of a single machine, which makes the bottleneck in large-scale learning the disk I/O, not the CPU. Following this observation, Yu et al. (2010) made significant progress in reducing disk usage, and their algorithms now outperform LIBLINEAR. In this paper, rather than optimizing algorithms on a single machine, we propose and implement distributed algorithms that achieve parallel disk loading and access the disk only once. Our large-scale learning algorithms are based on the framework of alternating direction methods of multipliers. The framework derives a subproblem that remains to be solved eciently for which we propose using dual coordinate descent and trust region Newton method. Our experimental evaluations on large datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speedup over the classifier proposed by Yu et al. running on a single machine. Our algorithms are faster than existing distributed solvers, such as Zinkevich et al. (2010)’s parallel stochastic gradient descent and Vowpal Wabbit.},

 abstract = {Given limited training samples, learning to classify multiple labels is challenging. Problem decomposition [24] is widely used in this case, where the original problem is decomposed into a set of easier-to-learn subproblems, and predictions from subproblems are combined to make the final decision. In this paper we show the connection between composite likelihoods [17] and many multilabel decomposition methods, e.g., one-vs-all, one-vs-one, calibrated label ranking, probabilistic classifier chain. This connection holds promise for improving problem decomposition in both the choice of subproblems and the combination of subproblem decisions. As an attempt to exploit this connection, we design a composite marginal method that improves pairwise decomposition. Pairwise label comparisons, which seem to be a natural choice for subproblems, are replaced by bivariate label densities, which are more informative and natural components in a composite likelihood. For combining subproblem decisions, we propose a new mean-field approximation that minimizes the notion of composite divergence and is potentially more robust to inaccurate estimations in subproblems. Empirical studies on five data sets show that, given limited training samples, the proposed method outperforms many alternatives.},

In contrast, linear SVM is much more scalable even on limited computing recourses (e.g. daily life PCs), but the learned model cannot capture non-linear concepts. To scale up kernel SVM on limited resources, we propose a low-rank linearization approach that transforms a non-linear SVM to a linear one via a novel, approximate empirical kernel map computed from efficient low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. We call it LLSVM (Low-rank Linearized SVM). We theoretically study the gap between the solutions of the optimal and approximate kernel map, which is used in turn to provide important guidance on the sampling based kernel approximations. Our algorithm inherits high efficiency of linear SVMs and rich repesentability of kernel classifiers.

We term this approach as “multi-label subspace ensemble (MSE)”. In the training stage, the data matrix is decomposed as the sum of several low-rank matrices and a sparse residual via a randomized optimization, where each low-rank part defines a subspace mapped by a label. In the prediction stage, the group sparse representation on the subspace ensemble is estimated by group lasso. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the appealing performance of MSE.},

 abstract = {While determining model complexity is an important problem in machine learning, many feature learning algorithms rely on cross-validation to choose an optimal number of features, which is usually challenging for online learning from a massive stream of data. In this paper, we propose an incremental feature learning algorithm to determine the optimal model complexity for large-scale, online datasets based on the denoising autoencoder. This algorithm is composed of two processes: adding features and merging features. Specifically, it adds new features to minimize the objective function’s residual and merges similar features to obtain a compact feature representation and prevent over-fitting. Our experiments show that the proposed model quickly converges to the optimal number of features in a large-scale online setting. In classification tasks, our model outperforms the (non-incremental) denoising autoencoder, and deep networks constructed from our algorithm perform favorably compared to deep belief networks and stacked denoising autoencoders. Further, the algorithm is eective in recognizing new patterns when the data distribution changes over time in the massive online data stream.},

 abstract = {A beta-negative binomial (BNB) process is proposed, leading to a beta-gamma-Poisson process, which may be viewed as a "multi-scoop" generalization of the beta-Bernoulli process. The BNB process is augmented into a beta-gamma-gamma-Poisson hierarchical structure, and applied as a nonparametric Bayesian prior for an infinite Poisson factor analysis model. A finite approximation for the beta process Levy random measure is constructed for convenient implementation. Efficient MCMC computations are performed with data augmentation and marginalization techniques. Encouraging results are shown on document count matrix factorization.},

 abstract = {This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output is an additive function of all the hidden states. Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima. In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a “robust” mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time. Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice. The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.},
