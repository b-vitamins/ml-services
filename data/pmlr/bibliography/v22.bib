  abstract = 	 {We introduce a novel technique, which we call  online-to-confidence-set conversion. The technique allows us to construct high-probability confidence sets for linear prediction  with correlated inputs given the predictions of any algorithm   (e.g., online LASSO, exponentiated gradient algorithm,   online least-squares, p-norm algorithm)   targeting online learning  with linear predictors and the quadratic loss. By construction, the size of the confidence set is   directly governed by the regret of the online learning algorithm. Constructing tight confidence sets is interesting on its own, but  the new technique is given extra weight by the fact   having access tight confidence sets underlies a number of    important problems. The advantage of our construction here is that  progress in constructing better algorithms for online prediction problems   directly translates into tighter confidence sets. In this paper, this is demonstrated in the case of linear stochastic bandits. In particular, we introduce the sparse variant of linear stochastic  bandits and show that a recent online algorithm together with our  online-to-confidence-set conversion allows one to derive  algorithms that can exploit if the reward is a function of a sparse   linear combination of the components of the chosen action.}

Standard algorithms either learn structures of specific predefined forms, or estimate sparse graphs in the data space ignoring the possibility of the latent variables. In contrast, our method learns rich dependencies and allows for latent variables that may confound the relations between the observations. We extend the model to conditional mixtures with side information and non-Gaussian marginal distributions of the observations. We then show that our model may be used for learning sparse latent variable structures corresponding to multiple unknown states, and for uncovering features useful for explaining and predicting structural changes. We apply the model to real-world financial data with heavy-tailed marginals covering the low- and high- market volatility periods of 2005-2011. We show that our method tends to give rise to significantly higher likelihoods of test data than standard network learning methods exploiting the sparsity assumption. We also demonstrate that our approach may be practical for financial stress testing and visualization of dependencies between financial instruments.}

We propose two novel tensor decompositions that incorporate sparsity: the Sparse Higher-Order SVD and the Sparse CP Decomposition. The latter solves a 1-norm penalized relaxation of the single-factor CP optimization problem, thereby automatically selecting relevant features for each tensor factor.

Motivated by other machine learning models for which   the existence of structure in the underlying distribution of data can reduce the complexity of estimation, we study and show how the factorization of the underlying  distribution into independent subspaces can help us to estimate diffusion maps more accurately. Building upon this result, we propose and develop  an algorithm that can automatically factorize a high dimensional data space in order to  minimize the error of estimation of its diffusion map, even in the case when the underlying distribution is not decomposable.

We also describe a simple variant of the algorithm that achieves a factor of two speedup over forward-backward on a single core. Experiments with our implementation of archipelagos for the computation of posterior marginal probabilities in an HMM validate the space/time complexity analysis: using four cores, the required memory on our test problem was reduced from 8 GB to 319 KB (a factor of 25000) relative to forward-backward, but completed in essentially the same time. The archipelagos algorithm applies to any dynamic graphical model, including dynamic Bayesian networks, conditional random fields, and hidden conditional random fields.}

In this paper, we consider the statistical problem of estimating the homology of a manifold from noisy samples under several different noise models. We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk for this problem. Our upper bounds are based on estimators which are constructed from a union of balls of appropriate radius around carefully selected sample points. In each case we establish complementary lower bounds using Le Camâs lemma.}

However, these algorithms often rely on the availability of expert hand-labeled data for training, which severely restricts the scalability of personalized monitoring within a real-world setting. While active learning offers a natural framework to address this issue, the relative merits of different active learning methodologies have not been extensively studied in the setting of developing clinically useful detectors for infrequent time-series events. In this paper, we identify a core set of principles that are relative to the specific goal of personalized long-term physiological monitoring. We describe and compare different approaches for initialization, batch selection and termination within the active learning process. We position this work in the context of epileptic seizure onset detection. When evaluated on a database of scalp EEG recordings from 23 epileptic patients, we show that a  combined distance- and diversity-based measure to determine the data to be queried, max-min clustering for identification of the initialization set, and a comparison of consecutive support vector sets to guide termination results in an active learning-based detector that can achieve similar performance to a patient-specific detector while requiring two orders of magnitude fewer labeled examples for training.}

This framework provides a straightforward way of favoring prescribed sparsity patterns, such as orderings, contiguous regions and overlapping groups, among others. Available optimization methods are limited to specific constraint sets and tend to not scale well with sample size and dimensionality.  We propose a first order proximal method, which builds upon results on fixed points and successive approximations. The algorithm can be applied to a general class of conic and norm constraints sets and relies on a proximity operator subproblem which can be computed numerically. Experiments on different regression problems demonstrate state-of-the art statistical performance, which improves over Lasso, Group Lasso and StructOMP. They also demonstrate the efficiency of the optimization algorithm and its scalability with the size of the problem.}

An important feature of the algorithm is to tie the adaptation of the proposal distribution to the choice of a particular restriction of the target to a domain where label switching cannot occur. The algorithm relies on a stochastic approximation procedure for which we exhibit a Lyapunov function that formally defines the criterion used for selecting the relabeling rule. This criterion reveals an interesting connection with the problem of optimal quantifier design in vector quantization which was only implicit in previous works on the label switching problem. In benchmark examples, the algorithm turns out to be fast converging and efficient at selecting meaningful non-trivial relabeling rules to allow accurate parameter inference.}

These nonparametric methods generalize previously reported results, and identify the type of knowledge that is needed for reasoning in the presence of selection bias.  Specifically,  we derive a general condition together with a procedure for  deciding recoverability of the odds ratio (OR) from s-biased data.

Also, they comprise only viral strain(s) that can be detected in the patientsâ blood serum. The approach presented in this paper tackles these issues by considering not only the most recent therapies but also the different treatment backgrounds of the samples making up the clinical data sets when predicting the outcomes of HIV therapies. For this purpose, we introduce a similarity measure for sequences of therapies and use it for training separate linear models for predicting therapy outcome for each target sample. Compared to the most commonly used approach that encodes all available treatment information only by specific input features our approach has the advantage of delivering significantly more accurate predictions for therapy-experienced patients and for rare therapies. Additionally, the sample-specific models are more interpretable which is very important in medical applications.}

The model jointly learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process operating on these diverse sources of data. Hence, the system ends up providing methods for knowledge acquisition and word-sense disambiguation within the context of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework.

However, there exist many application domains where the distributions cannot easily be defined on a Euclidean space. To address this limitation, we propose a general constrained version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and  give conditions under which the Markov chain  is convergent. Based on this general framework we define a family of MCMC methods which can be applied to sample from distributions on non-linear manifolds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  on a variety of problems including sampling from the Bingham-von Mises-Fisher distribution, collaborative filtering and  human pose estimation.}

Several such parameterizations of models for binary data are known, including the Ising, generalized Ising, canonical and full parameterizations.  We also discuss a parameterization that we call the âspectral parameterizationâ, which has received significantly less coverage in existing literature.  We provide this parameterization with a spectral interpretation by casting log-linear models in terms of orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard harmonic expansions.  Using various standard and group sparse regularizers for structural learning, we provide a comprehensive theoretical and empirical comparison of these parameterizations.  We show that the spectral parameterization, along with the canonical, has the best performance and sparsity levels, while the spectral does not depend on any particular reference state.  The spectral interpretation also provides a new starting point for analyzing the statistics of binary data sets; we measure the magnitude of higher order interactions in the underlying distributions for several data sets.}

However, tight near-optimality guarantees are not yet available for the general case of stochastic Markov decision processes and closed-loop, state-dependent planning policies. We therefore consider an algorithm related to AO* that optimistically explores a tree representation of the space of closed-loop policies, and we analyze the near-optimality of the action it returns after n tree node expansions. While this optimistic planning requires a finite number of actions and possible next states for each transition, its asymptotic performance does not depend directly on these numbers, but only on the subset of nodes that significantly impact near-optimal policies. We characterize this set by introducing a novel measure of problem complexity, called the near-optimality exponent. Specializing the exponent and performance bound for some interesting classes of MDPs illustrates the algorithm works better when there are fewer near-optimal policies and less uniform transition probabilities.}

Such structured penalty poses new challenge on optimization techniques. To address this challenge, by specializing the excessive gap framework, we develop a scalable primal-dual optimization algorithm with a fast rate of convergence. Empirical results show that the proposed optimization algorithm is more efficient than existing state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the structured sparse CCA on both simulated and genetic datasets.}

In this paper we propose an algorithm that constructs a cascade of classifiers that explicitly trades-off operational cost and classifier accuracy while accounting for on-demand feature extraction costs. Different from previous work, our algorithm re-optimizes trained classifiers and allows expensive features to be scheduled at any stage within the cascade to minimize overall cost. Experiments on actual web-search ranking data sets demonstrate that our framework leads to drastic test-time improvements.}

We introduce a family of online clustering algorithms by extending algorithms for online supervised learning, with access to expert predictors, to the unsupervised learning setting. Instead of computing prediction errors in order to re-weight the experts, the algorithms compute an approximation to the current value of the k-means objective obtained by each expert.  When the experts are batch clustering algorithms with b-approximation guarantees with respect to the k-means objective (for example, the k-means++ or k-means# algorithms), applied to a sliding window of the data stream, our algorithms obtain approximation guarantees with respect to the k-means objective. The form of these online clustering approximation guarantees is novel, and extends an evaluation framework proposed by Dasgupta as an analog to regret. Notably, our approximation bounds are with respect to the optimal k-means cost on the entire data stream seen so far, even though the algorithm is online. Our algorithmâs empirical performance tracks that of the best clustering algorithm in its expert set.}

Network-based classifiers, such as the tree augmented naive Bayes model, are  appealing since they are easily interpretable, can naturally handle missing data, and are often quite effective. Yet, for complex domains with continuous explanatory variables, practical performance is often sub-optimal. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Copula Network Classifiers (CNCs), a model that combines the flexibility of a graph based representation with the modeling power of copulas. As we  demonstrate on ten varied continuous real-life datasets, CNCs offer better overall performance than linear and non-linear standard generative models, as well as discriminative RBF and polynomial kernel SVMs. In addition, since no parameter tuning is required, CNCs can be trained dramatically faster than SVMs.}

For two common copula families, we prove that the expected likelihood of a building block edge in the model is monotonic in Spearmanâs rank correlation measure. We also show numerically that the same relationship holds for many other copula families. This allows us to perform structure learning while bypassing costly parameter estimation as well as explicit computation of the log-likelihood function.

  abstract = 	 {In many fields of science researchers are faced with the problem of estimating causal effects from non-experimental data. A key issue is to avoid inconsistent estimators due to confounding by measured or unmeasured covariates, a problem commonly solved by âadjusting forâ a subset of the observed variables. When the data generating process can be represented by a directed acyclic graph, and this graph structure is known, there exist simple graphical procedures for determining which subset of covariates should be adjusted for to obtain consistent estimators of the causal effects. However, when the graph is not known no general and complete procedures for this task are available. In this paper we introduce such a method for linear non-Gaussian models, requiring only partial knowledge about the temporal ordering of the variables: We provide a simple statistical test for inferring whether an estimator of a causal effect is consistent when controlling for a subset of measured covariates, and we present heuristics to search for such a set. We show empirically that this statistical test identifies consistent vs inconsistent estimates, and that the search heuristics outperform the naive approach of adjusting for all observed covariates.}

Since the columns belong to a union of subspaces, this problem may also be viewed as a missing-data version of the subspace clustering problem.  Let X be an nxN matrix whose (complete) columns lie in a union of at most k subspaces, each of rank = r  n, and assume Nkn. The main result of the paper shows that under mild assumptions each column of X can be perfectly recovered with high probability from an incomplete version so long as at least C r N \log^2(n) entries of X are observed uniformly at random, with C1 a constant depending on the usual incoherence conditions, the geometrical arrangement of subspaces, and the distribution of columns over the subspaces.

This paper develops a semiparametric estimator of probability density functions based on the nonparanormal transformation, which has been recently proposed for mapping arbitrarily distributed data samples onto normally distributed datasets. Pointwise and uniform consistency properties are established for the developed method. The resulting density model is then applied to pseudo-likelihood estimation in Markov random fields. An experimental evaluation on data distributed according to a variety of density functions indicates that such semiparametric Markov random field models significantly outperform both their Gaussian and kernel-based alternatives in terms of prediction accuracy.}

In order to evaluate FIC, we propose factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference (FAB), which maximizes an asymptotically-consistent lower bound of FIC. FIC and FAB have several desirable properties: 1) asymptotic consistency with the marginal log-likelihood, 2) automatic component selection on the basis of an intrinsic shrinkage mechanism, and 3) parameter identifiability in mixture modeling. Experimental results show that FAB outperforms state-of-the-art VB methods.}

First, we present several dynamical systems that demonstrate the difficulty of learning in the general case, without making additional assumptions. We state the necessary condition that the underlying system must satisfy to be amenable for learning.  Second, we discuss the relationship between this condition and state-of-the-art predictive representations, and we show that there are systems that satisfy the above condition but cannot be modeled by such representations.

Under weak regularity conditions, the parameters can be integrated out in the likelihood, leading to a closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood. However, the assumption of prior independence is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where the segment-specific regulatory relationships among the interdependent quantities tend to undergo gradual evolutionary adaptations. We therefore propose a Bayesian coupling scheme to introduce systematic information sharing among the segment-specific interaction parameters. We investigate the effect this model improvement has on the network reconstruction accuracy in a reverse engineering context, where the objective is to learn the structure of a gene regulatory network from temporal gene expression profiles.}

To overcome this problem, we propose an approach called Locality Preserving Feature Learning (LPFL), which incorporates feature selection into LPI. Specifically, we aim to find a subset of features, and learn a linear transformation to optimize the Locality Preserving Criterion based on these features. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer programming problem, which we relax into a constrained Frobenius norm minimization problem, and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction Method (ADM). ADM, which iteratively updates the linear transformation matrix, the residue matrix and the Lagrangian multiplier, is theoretically guaranteed to converge at the rate O(1/t). Experiments on benchmark document datasets show that our proposed method outperforms LPI, as well as other state-of-the-art document analysis approaches.}

The new method estimates the density of states, which counts the number of states associated with a particular value of the likelihood. If the density of states is known, computation of the marginal likelihood reduces to a one- dimensional integral. We outline a maximum likelihood procedure to estimate the density of states from annealed posterior samples. We apply our method to various likelihoods and show that it is superior to thermodynamic integration in that it is more flexible with regard to the annealing schedule and the family of bridging distributions.

The optimal strategy, normalized maximum likelihood (NML), is computationally demanding and requires the length of the game to be known. We consider two simpler strategies: sequential normalized maximum likelihood (SNML), which computes the NML forecasts at each round as if it were the last round, and Bayesian prediction. Under appropriate conditions, both are known to achieve near-optimal regret.  In this paper, we investigate when these strategies are optimal. We show that SNML is optimal iff the joint distribution on sequences defined by SNML is exchangeable. In the case of exponential families, this is equivalent to the optimality of any Bayesian prediction strategy, and the optimal prior is Jeffreys prior.}

Existing methods based on extensions of generative models such as k-means or Switching Linear Dynamical Systems often lead to intractable inference and lack a mechanism for feature selection, critical when dealing with high dimensional data. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Maximum Margin Temporal Clustering (MMTC). MMTC simultaneously determines the start and the end of each segment, while learning a multi-class Support Vector Machine to discriminate among temporal clusters. MMTC extends Maximum Margin Clustering in two ways: first, it incorporates the notion of TC, and second, it introduces additional constraints to achieve better balance between clusters. Experiments on clustering human actions and bee dancing motions illustrate the benefits of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

However the optimal policy requires a computation of a convex optimization which involves the empirical distribution of each arm. In this paper, we propose a policy which exploits the first d empirical moments for arbitrary d fixed in advance. We show that the performance of the policy approaches the theoretical bound as d increases. This policy can be implemented by solving polynomial equations, which we derive the explicit solution for d smaller than 5. By choosing appropriate d, the proposed policy realizes a tradeoff between the computational complexity and the expected regret.}

Note that this is also equivalent to recovering the underlying graph structure of a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF).  We present two novel greedy approaches to solving this problem.  The first estimates the non-zero covariates of the overall inverse covariance matrix using a series of global forward and backward greedy steps.  The second estimates the neighborhood of each node in the graph separately, again using greedy forward and backward steps, and combines the intermediate neighborhoods to form an overall estimate. The principal contribution of this paper is a rigorous analysis of the sparsistency, or consistency in recovering the sparsity pattern of the inverse covariance matrix. Surprisingly, we show that both the local and global greedy methods learn the full structure of the model with high probability given just O(d log(p)) samples, which is a significant improvement over state of the art L1-regularized Gaussian MLE (Graphical Lasso) that requires O(d^2 log(p)) samples. Moreover, the restricted eigenvalue and smoothness conditions imposed by our greedy methods are much weaker than the strong irrepresentable conditions required by the L1-regularization based methods. We corroborate our results with extensive simulations and examples, comparing our local and global greedy methods to the L1-regularized Gaussian MLE as well as the nodewise L1-regularized linear regression (Neighborhood Lasso).}

We give a general formulation for a class of Bayesian index policies that rely on quantiles of the posterior distribution. For binary bandits, we prove that the corresponding algorithm, termed Bayes-UCB, satisfies finite-time regret bounds that imply its asymptotic optimality.  More generally, Bayes-UCB appears as an unifying framework for several variants of the UCB algorithm addressing different bandit problems (parametric multi-armed bandits, Gaussian bandits with unknown mean and variance, linear bandits). But the generality of the Bayesian approach makes it possible to address more challenging models. In particular, we show how to handle linear bandits with sparsity constraints by resorting to Gibbs sampling.}

This framework explicitly models the relationship between each modelâs output and the unknown true label. The framework does not require that the models be probabilistic (they can even be human assessors), that they share prior information or receive the same training data, or that they be independent in their errors. Finally, the Bayesian combiner does not need to believe any of the models is in fact correct.  We test several variants of this classifier combination procedure starting from a classic statistical model proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979) and using MCMC to add more complex but important features to the model. Comparisons on several data sets to simpler methods like majority voting show that the Bayesian methods not only perform well but result in interpretable diagnostics on the data points and the models.}

Also, we are able to take into account the dependencies induced when evaluating classifiers on the same test set. Finally we make optimal use (in the Bayesian sense) of all the testing data we have. We demonstrate empirically that our approach is more reliable than the sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the current state of the art for algorithm comparisons.}

In this paper we present a novel method for the hypergraph clustering problem, in which second or higher order affinities between sets of data points are considered. Our algorithm has important theoretical properties, such as convergence and satisfaction of first order necessary optimality conditions. It is based on an efficient iterative procedure, which by updating the cluster membership of all points in parallel, is able to achieve state of the art results in very few steps. We outperform current hypergraph clustering methods especially in terms of computational speed, but also in terms of accuracy.

Can we detect the outliers and segment the samples into their right subspaces, efficiently and exactly? We utilize a so-called Low-Rank Representation (LRR) method to solve this problem, and prove that under mild technical conditions, any solution to LRR exactly recover the row space of the samples and detect the outliers as well. Since the subspace membership is provably determined by the row space, this further implies that LRR can perform exact subspace segmentation and outlier detection, in an efficient way.}

We make use of the proposed model structure and the conjugate gradient method to compute the required transformation. In the experimental part, the proposed algorithm is compared to the standard approach using the sparse Cholesky decomposition and it is shown to be much faster and computationally feasible for 100-1000 times larger datasets.

Segmentation and recognition of observed movement could thus proceed out of this existing knowledge, which is directly compatible with movement generation. In this paper, we address exactly this scenario. We assume that a library of movement primitives has already been taught, and we wish to identify elements of the library in a complex motor act, where the individual elements have been smoothed together, and, occasionally, there might be a movement segment that is not in our library yet. We employ a flexible machine learning representation of movement primitives based on learnable nonlinear attractor system. For the purpose of movement segmentation and recognition, it is possible to reformulate this representation as a controlled linear dynamical system.  An Expectation-Maximization algorithm can be developed to estimate the open parameters of a movement primitive from the library, using as input an observed trajectory piece. If no matching primitive from the library can be found, a new primitive is created. This process allows a straightforward sequential segmentation of observed movement into known and new primitives, which are suitable for robot imitation learning. We illustrate our approach with synthetic examples and data collected from human movement.}

Most useful graph partitioning criteria correspond to optimizing a ratio between the cut and the size of the partitions, this ratio leads to an NP-hard problem that is only solved approximately. This makes it difficult to know whether failures of the algorithm are due to failures of the optimization or to the criterion being optimized. In this paper we present a framework that seeks and finds the optimal solution of several NP-hard graph partitioning problems. We use a classical approach to ratio problems where we repeatedly ask whether the optimal solution is greater than or less than some constant - lambda. Our main insight is the equivalence between this âlambda  questionâ and performing inference in a graphical model with many local potentials and one high-order potential. We show that this specific form of the high-order potential is amenable to message-passing algorithms and how to obtain a bound on the optimal solution from the messages. Our experiments show that in many cases our approach yields the global optimum and improves the popular spectral solution.}

This is equivalent to minimizing a score that consists of two terms: (i) the negative log-likelihood of the output, ensuring that the output has a high probability; and (ii) a measure of uncertainty over the distribution of the hidden variables conditioned on the input and the output, ensuring that there is little confusion in the values of the hidden variables. Given a training dataset, the parameters of an M3E model are learned by maximizing the margin between the Renyi entropies of the ground-truth output and all other incorrect outputs. Training an M3E can be viewed as minimizing an upper bound on a user-defined loss, and includes, as a special case, the latent support vector machine framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of M3E models on two standard machine learning applications, discriminative motif finding and image classification, using publicly available datasets.}

However, this naive solution cannot make use of standard solvers for linear equations and is doomed to construct lifted networks in each iteration of the interior-point method again,  an operation that can itself be quite costly. To address both issues, we show how to read off an equivalent LP from the lifted GaBP computations that can be solved using any off-the-shelf LP solver.

Features relevant to one clustering interpretation may be different from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation or view of the data.  In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and the feature subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our model, the features in different views may be shared and therefore the sets of relevant features are allowed to overlap.  We model feature relevance to each view using an Indian Buffet Process and the cluster membership in each view using a Chinese Restaurant Process.  We provide an inference approach to learn the latent parameters corresponding to this multiple partitioning problem.  Our model not only learns the features and clusters in each view but also automatically learns the number of clusters, number of views and number of features in each view.}

It offers performance superior to Monte Carlo methods by exploiting a Bayesian quadrature framework. We improve upon previous Bayesian quadrature techniques by explicitly modelling the non-negativity of our integrands, and the correlations that exist between them. It offers most where the integrand is multi-modal and expensive to evaluate, as is commonplace in exoplanets research; we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on data from the Kepler spacecraft.}

  abstract = 	 {Most speech analysis/synthesis systems are based on the basic physical model of speech production - the acoustic tube model. There are two main drawbacks with current speech analysis methods. First, a common design paradigm seems to build a special-purpose signal-processing front-end followed by (when appropriate) a back-end based on probabilistic models. A difficulty is that most features are nonlinear operators of the speech waveform, whose statistical behavior is hard to be modeled. Second, different tasks of speech analysis are carried out separately. These practices are admittedly useful but not optimal due to the incomplete use of available information. These examinations motivate us to directly model the spectrogram and to integrate together the three fundamental speech parameters - the pitch, energy and spectral envelope. We successfully devise such a model called probabilistic acoustic tube (PAT) model. The integration is performed in a principled manner with explicit physical meaning. We demonstrate the capability of PAT for a number of speech analysis/synthesis tasks, such as pitch tracking under both clean and additive noise conditions, speech synthesis, and phoneme clustering.}

Substantial research has been focused on the approximation of the constraint set, also known as the marginal polytope. This paper presents a novel inference algorithm that tightens and solves the optimization problem by intersecting the popular local polytope and the semidefinite outer bound of the marginal polytope. Using dual decomposition, our method separates the optimization problem into two subproblems: a semidefinite program (SDP), which is solved by a low-rank SDP algorithm, and a free-energy based optimization problem, which is solved by convex belief propagation. Our method has a very reasonable computational complexity and its actual running time is typically within a small factor (=10) of convex belief propagation. Tested on both synthetic data and a real-world protein side-chain packing benchmark, our method significantly outperforms tree-reweighted belief propagation in both marginal probability inference and MAP inference.  Our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in MRF inference, solving all protein tasks solved by the recently presented MPLP method, and beating MPLP on lattices with strong edge potentials.}

The bound makes use of a subset of the variables, a feedback vertex set, which allows us to decompose the graph into tractable parts. Furthermore, a tightening strategy for the bound is presented, which finds the states of the feedback vertex set that maximally increase the bound, and clamps them. Based on this lower bound we derive batch and online learning algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on a computer vision problem.}

However, they have limited expressive power and often cannot represent the posterior distribution correctly. While learning the parameters of such models which have insufficient expressivity, researchers use loss functions to penalize certain misrepresentations of the solution space. Till now, researchers have used only simplistic loss functions such as the hamming loss, to enable efficient inference. The paper shows how sophisticated and useful higher order loss functions can be incorporated in the learning process. These loss functions ensure that the MAP solution does not deviate much from the ground truth in terms of certain \emphhigher order statistics. We propose a learning algorithm which uses the recently proposed lower-envelope representation of higher order functions to transform them to pairwise functions, which allow efficient inference. We test the efficacy of our method on the problem of foreground-background image segmentation. Experimental results show that the incorporation of higher order loss functions in the learning formulation using our method leads to much better results compared to those obtained by using the traditional hamming loss.}

We derive a second-order algorithm for computing the maximum a posteriori state path estimate, where the cost per iteration scales linearly both in time and memory. This is done by computing an approximate Newton direction using an efficient forward-backward scheme based on a sequence of low rank updates. We formalize the conditions under which our algorithm is applicable and prove its stability and convergence.

We study the theoretical properties of the transformation by noting that they make the Fisher information matrix closer to a diagonal matrix, and thus standard gradient closer to the natural gradient. We experimentally confirm the usefulness of the transformations by noting that they make basic stochastic gradient learning competitive with state-of-the-art learning algorithms in speed, and that they seem also to help find solutions that generalize better. The experiments include both classification of small images and learning a low-dimensional representation for images by using a deep unsupervised auto-encoder network. The transformations were beneficial in all cases, with and without regularization and with networks from two to five hidden layers.}

Here different parties own different parts of a data set, and the goal is to learn a classifier from the entire data set without any party revealing any information about the individual data points it owns. Pathak et al (2010) recently proposed a solution to this problem in which each party learns a local classifier from its own data, and a third party then aggregates these classifiers in a privacy-preserving manner using a cryptographic scheme. The generalization performance of their algorithm is sensitive to the number of parties and the relative fractions of data owned by the different parties. In this paper, we describe a new differentially private algorithm for the multiparty setting that uses a stochastic gradient descent based procedure to directly optimize the overall multiparty objective rather than combining classifiers learned from optimizing local objectives. The algorithm achieves a slightly weaker form of differential privacy than that of Pathak et al (2010), but provides improved generalization guarantees that do not depend on the number of parties or the relative sizes of the individual data sets. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.}

We focus on group-structured patterns in this paper. Under this model, groups of signal coefficients are active (or inactive) together. The groups are prede- fined, but the particular set of groups that are active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups (e.g., compositions, sizes, ex- tents, overlaps, etc.). Experiments show that our result holds for a variety of overlapping group configurations.}

The reason is that prior knowledge about which tasks are unrelated can lead to sparser and more informative representations for each task, essentially screening out idiosyncrasies of the data distribution. We propose a novel method which builds on a prior multitask methodology by favoring a shared low dimensional  representation within each group of tasks. In addition, we impose a penalty on tasks from different groups which encourages the two representations to be orthogonal. We further discuss a condition which ensures convexity of the optimization problem and argue that it can be solved by alternating minimization.

We compute a single composite score for the entire spatio-temporal data sample based on the local neighborhood distances. We declare data samples as containing local anomalies based on the composite score.

Recently, variational Bayesian (VB) inference techniques have successfully been applied to such large scale bilinear models. However, current algorithms are of the alternate updating or stochastic gradient descent type, slow to converge and prone to getting stuck in shallow local minima. While for MAP or maximum margin estimation, singular value shrinkage algorithms have been proposed which can far outperform alternate updating, this methodological avenue remains unexplored for Bayesian techniques. In this paper, we show how to combine a recent singular value shrinkage characterization of fully observed spherical Gaussian VB matrix factorization with augmented Lagrangian techniques in order to obtain efficient VB inference for general MF models with arbitrary likelihood potentials. In particular, we show how to handle Poisson and Bernoulli potentials, far more suited for most MF applications than Gaussian likelihoods. Our algorithm can be run even for very large models and is easily implemented in \em Matlab. It outperforms MAP estimation on a range of real-world datasets.}

In this paper, we study the runtime of learning as a function of the number of available training examples, and underscore the main high-level techniques. We provide the first formal positive result showing that even in the unrealizable case, the runtime can decrease exponentially while only  requiring a polynomial growth of the number of examples. Our construction corresponds to a synthetic learning problem and an interesting open question is whether the tradeoff can be shown for more natural learning problems. We spell out several interesting candidates of natural learning problems for which we conjecture that there is a tradeoff between computational and sample complexity.}

While there have been some attempts at coming up with efficient algorithms for solving the fused lasso optimization, a theoretical analysis of its performance is mostly lacking except for the simple linear graph topology. In this paper, we investigate \em sparsistency of  fused lasso for general graph structures, i.e. its ability to correctly recover the exact support of piece-wise constant graph-structured patterns asymptotically (for large-scale graphs). To emphasize this distinction over previous work,  we will refer to it as Edge Lasso. We focus on the (structured) normal means setting, and our results provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph properties as well as the signal-to-noise ratio needed to ensure sparsistency. We examplify our results using simple graph-structured patterns, and demonstrate that in some cases fused lasso is sparsistent at very weak signal-to-noise ratios (scaling as \sqrt(\log n)/|A|, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and A is the smallest set of vertices with constant activation).  In other cases, it performs no better than thresholding the difference of measurements at vertices which share an edge (which requires signal-to-noise ratio that scales as \sqrt\log n).}

The Bethe approximation reduces the problem of computing the partition function in a graphical model to that of solving a set of non-linear equations, so-called the Bethe equation. On the other hand, the BP algorithm is a popular heuristic method for estimating marginal distribution in a graphical model. Although they are inspired and developed from different directions, Yedidia, Freeman and Weiss (2004) established a somewhat surprising connection: the BP algorithm solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally motivates the following important question to understand their limitations and empirical successes: the Bethe equation is computationally easy to solve? We present a message passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in polynomial number of bitwise operations for arbitrary binary graphical models of n nodes where the maximum degree in the underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm, an alternative to BP fixing its convergence issue, is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed point computation in such a large class of graphical models. Moreover, we believe that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity of the cavity method in statistical physics.}

Autoencoders, in particular, have proven to be an effective way to learn latent codes that reflect meaningful variations in data. A continuing challenge, however, is guiding an autoencoder toward representations that are useful for particular tasks. A complementary challenge is to find codes that are invariant to irrelevant transformations of the data. The most common way of introducing such problem-specific guidance in autoencoders has been through the incorporation of a parametric component that ties the latent representation to the label information. In this work, we argue that a preferable approach relies instead on a nonparametric guidance mechanism. Conceptually, it ensures that there exists a function that can predict the label information, without explicitly instantiating that function. The superiority of this guidance mechanism is confirmed on two datasets. In particular, this approach is able to incorporate invariance information (lighting, elevation, etc.) from the small NORB object recognition dataset and yields state-of-the-art performance for a single layer, non-convolutional network.}

In this paper, we propose a new approach for sparse multiple-output regression that can jointly learn both the output structure and regression coefficients with structured sparsity. Our approach reformulates the standard regression model into an alternative parameterization that leads to a conditional Gaussian graphical model, and employes an inverse-covariance regularization. We show that the orthant-wise quasi-Newton algorithm developed for L1-regularized log-linear model can be adopted for a fast optimization for our method. We demonstrate our method on simulated datasets and real datasets from genetics and finances applications.}

Our proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between an empirical cumulative hazard function and its best approximation from the class of distributions constituting the null hypothesis. It turns out that the least favorable distribution, which produces the largest probability of Type I error of each of the tests, is the exponential distribution. This fact is used to produce an appropriate cut-off or p-value. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to check small sample size (i.e., significance) and power of the test. Usefulness of the test is illustrated through the analysis of a set of monthly family expenditure data collected by the National Sample Survey Organization of the Government of India.}

We further show that other properties, such as symmetry or submodularity imply structure in the Fourier spectrum, which can be exploited to further reduce sample complexity. One interesting special case  is that it suffices to observe O(|E| log^4 |V|) values of a cut function to recover a graph.

This permits searching for the MAP solution in O(BH+Q) instead of O(BH^2) (without using the data structure), where B is the number of branches and Q is the one-time cost to build the data structure which is proportional to H^2. Our analysis on synthetic data shows that, given a limited time budget, our method solves problems that are characterized by a much larger number of states when compared to state-of-the-art exact inference algorithms (e.g., Marinescu and Dechter (2007); Sontag et al.

More specifically, they identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once for each group, as opposed to once for each variable. The groups are defined by means of constraints, so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity of the constraint language. Existing approaches for exact lifted inference rely on (in)equality constraints. We show how inference methods can be generalized to work with arbitrary constraints. This allows them to capture a broader range of symmetries, leading to more opportunities for lifting. We empirically demonstrate that this improves inference efficiency with orders of magnitude, allowing exact inference in cases where until now only approximate inference was feasible.}

When the additional information has structure that factorizes according to small subsets of variables (i.e., is \emphlow order, or \emphdecomposable),  several approaches can be used to incorporate it into a learning procedure.   Our focus in this work is the more challenging case, where the additional information does not factorize according to low order graphical model structure; we call this the \emphhigh order case. We propose to formalize various forms of this additional information as high order loss functions, which may have complex interactions over large subsets of variables. We then address the computational challenges inherent in learning according to such loss functions, particularly focusing on the loss-augmented inference problem that arises in large margin learning; we show that learning with high order loss functions is often practical, giving strong empirical results, with one popular and several novel high-order loss functions, in several settings.}

As different radioactive materials have different effects to human body, it is important to know the types of nuclides and their levels of concentration from the recorded mixture of radiations to well take necessary measures. We presently formulate a Bayesian generative model for the data available on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster across Japan. The model can infer from the sparsely sampled measurements what nuclides are present as well as their concentration levels. An important property of the proposed model is that it admits unique recovery of the parameters. On synthetic data we demonstrate that our model is able to infer the underlying components and on data from the Fukushima Daiichi plant we establish that the model is able to well account for the data. We further demonstrate how the model extends to include all the available measurements recorded throughout Japan. The model can be considered a first attempt to apply Bayesian learning unsupervised in order to give a more detailed account also of the latent structure present in the data of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.}

We consider learning when the learner has access to weakly labeled random samples and, on top of that, can actively query the correct labels of sample points of its choice. We propose a learning algorithm for this scenario, analyze its sample complexity and prove that, under certain conditions on the underlying data distribution, our learner can utilize the weak labels to reduce the number of expert labels it requires. We view this paper as a first step towards the development of a theory of learning from labels generated by teachers of varying accuracy, a scenario that is relevant in various practical applications.}

In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace.  As with the Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly constructed, and is computed using a subset of data.  In practice, as in HF, we typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the Gauss-Newton matrix.  We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy.  It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter.  The chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov subspace.}

We propose a method where both the dimensionality reduction and the mapping can be nonlinear and are estimated jointly. Our key idea is to define an objective function where the low-dimensional coordinates are free parameters, in addition to the dimensionality reduction and the mapping. This has the effect of decoupling many groups of parameters from each other, affording a far more effective optimization than if using a deep network with nested mappings, and to use a good initialization from slice inverse regression or spectral methods. Our experiments with image and robot applications show our approach to improve over direct regression and various existing approaches.}

Although this perspective establishes links between classical training principles, the existing formulation only applies to linear predictors under squared loss, hence is extremely limited. We generalize the formulation of optimal reverse prediction to arbitrary Bregman divergences, and more importantly to nonlinear predictors. This extension is achieved by establishing a new, generalized form of forward-reverse minimization equivalence that holds for arbitrary matching losses. Several benefits follow. First, a new variant of Bregman divergence clustering can be recovered that incorporates a non-linear data reconstruction model. Second, normalized-cut and kernel-based extensions can be formulated coherently. Finally, a new semi-supervised training principle can be recovered for classification problems that demonstrates advantages over the state of the art.}

This setting is of great interest as annotatorsâ expertise generally varies and could depend on the given sample itself; additionally, some annotators may be adversarial. Thus, clearly the information provided by some annotators should be more valuable than that provided by others and it could vary across data points. We propose an AL approach for this new scenario motivated by information theoretic principles. Specifically, we focus on maximizing the information that an annotator label provides about the true (but unknown) label of the data point. We develop this concept, propose an algorithm for active learning, and experimentally validate the proposed approach.}

  abstract = 	 {The use of the standard hinge loss for structured outputs, for the learning to rank problem, faces two main caveats: (a) the label space, the set of all possible permutations of items to be ranked, is too large, and also less amenable to the usual dynamic-programming based techniques used for structured outputs, and (b) the supervision or training data consists of instances with multiple labels per input, instead of just a single label. The most natural way to deal with such multiple labels leads, unfortunately, to a non-convex surrogate. In this paper, we propose a general class of perturbation-based surrogates that leverage the large margin approach, and are convex. We show that the standard hinge surrogate for classification actually falls within this class. We also find a surrogate within this class, for the ranking problem, that does not suffer from the caveats mentioned above. Indeed, our experiments demonstrate that it performs better than other candidate large margin proposals on both synthetic and real world ranking datasets.}

In this paper, we generalize this method to the setup of sparse approximation over a pre-fixed dictionary. A fully corrective forward selection algorithm is proposed along with convergence analysis. The per-iteration computational overhead of the proposed algorithm is dominated by a subproblem of linear optimization over the dictionary and a subproblem to optimally adjust the aggregation weights. The former is cheaper in several applications than the Euclidean projection while the latter is typically an unconstrained optimization problem which is relatively easy to solve. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to the setting of non-negative/convex sparse approximation over a dictionary.Applications of our algorithms to several concrete learning problems are explored with efficiency validated on benchmark data sets.}

Under a restricted set of technical conditions, our algorithm runs in $O((\log_2(n))^3 |E|)$ time, where n is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the sampled graph. We demonstrate the scalability of our algorithm via extensive empirical evaluation; we can sample a MAGM graph with 8  million nodes and 20 billion edges in under 6 hours.}

Modern algorithms for linear classification can train reasonably good models while going through the data in only tens of rounds. However, large data often does not fit in the memory of a single machine, which makes the bottleneck in large-scale learning the disk I/O, not the CPU. Following this observation, Yu et al. (2010) made significant progress in reducing disk usage, and their algorithms now outperform LIBLINEAR. In this paper, rather than optimizing algorithms on a single machine, we propose and implement distributed algorithms that achieve parallel disk loading and access the disk only once. Our large-scale learning algorithms are based on the framework of alternating direction methods of multipliers. The framework derives a subproblem that remains to be solved efficiently for which we propose using dual coordinate descent. Our experimental evaluations on large datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve significant speedup over the classifier proposed by Yu et al. running on a single machine. Our algorithms are faster than existing distributed solvers, such as Zinkevich et al. (2010)âs parallel stochastic gradient descent and Vowpal Wabbit.}

Problem decomposition is widely used in this case, where the original problem is decomposed into a set of easier-to-learn subproblems, and predictions from subproblems are combined to make the final decision. In this paper we show the connection between composite likelihoods and many multi-label decomposition methods, e.g., one-vs-all, one-vs-one, calibrated label ranking, probabilistic classifier chain. This connection holds promise for improving problem decomposition in both the choice of subproblems and the combination of subproblem decisions. As an attempt to exploit this connection, we design a composite marginal method that improves pairwise decomposition. Pairwise label comparisons, which seem to be a natural choice for subproblems, are replaced by bivariate label densities, which are more informative and natural components in a composite likelihood.  For combining subproblem decisions, we propose a new mean-field approximation that minimizes the notion of composite divergence and is potentially more robust to inaccurate estimations in subproblems. Empirical studies on five data sets show that, given limited training samples, the proposed method outperforms many alternatives.}

In contrast, linear SVM is much more scalable even on limited computing recourses (e.g. daily life PCs), but the learned model cannot capture non-linear concepts. To scale up kernel SVM on limited resources, we propose a low-rank linearization approach that transforms a non-linear SVM to a linear one via a novel, approximate empirical kernel map computed from efficient low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. We call it LLSVM (Low-rank Linearized SVM). We theoretically study the gap between the solutions of the optimal and approximate kernel map, which is used in turn to provide important guidance on the sampling based kernel approximations. Our algorithm inherits high efficiency of linear SVMs and rich repesentability of kernel classifiers. Evaluation against large-scale linear and kernel SVMs on several truly large data sets shows that the proposed method achieves a better tradeoff between scalability and model representability.}

We term this approach as âmulti-label subspace ensemble (MSE)â. In the training stage, the data matrix is decomposed as the sum of several low-rank matrices and a sparse residual via a randomized optimization, where each low-rank part defines a subspace mapped by a label. In the prediction stage, the group sparse representation on the subspace ensemble is estimated by group lasso. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the appealing performance of MSE.}

In this paper, we propose an incremental feature learning algorithm to determine the optimal model complexity for large-scale, online datasets based on the denoising autoencoder. This algorithm is composed of two processes: adding features and merging features. Specifically, it adds new features to minimize the objective functionâs residual and merges similar features to obtain a compact feature representation and prevent over-fitting. Our experiments show that the model quickly converges to the optimal number of features in a large-scale online setting, and outperforms the (non-incremental) denoising autoencoder, as well as deep belief networks and stacked denoising autoencoders for classification tasks. Further, the algorithm is particularly effective in recognizing new patterns when the data distribution changes over time in the massive online data stream.}

Although such models are very powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly susceptible to local optima.  In this paper we propose an alternative inference method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a ârobustâ mixture component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time.  Combining these elements we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing approaches in practice.  The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation, the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance, and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate signal.}
