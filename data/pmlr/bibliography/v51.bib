  abstract = 	 {Coresets are efficient representations of data sets such that models trained on the coreset are provably competitive with models trained on the original data set. As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models such as K-Means and Gaussian mixture models to massive data sets. However, until now, the algorithms and the corresponding theory were usually specific to each clustering problem.  We propose a single, practical algorithm to construct strong coresets for a large class of hard and soft clustering problems based on Bregman divergences. This class includes hard clustering with popular distortion measures such as the Squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance, KL-divergence and Itakura-Saito distance. The corresponding soft clustering problems are directly related to popular mixture models due to a dual relationship between Bregman divergences and Exponential family distributions. Our theoretical results further imply a randomized polynomial-time approximation scheme for hard clustering. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed algorithm in an empirical evaluation.}

One of the relevant applications for this setting is marketing in social networks, where the marketer aims at finding and taking advantage of the most influential customers. The existing approaches for bandit problems on graphs require either partial or complete knowledge of the graph. In this paper, we do not assume any knowledge of the graph, but we consider a setting where it can be gradually discovered in a sequential and active way. At each round, the learner chooses a node of the graph and the only information it receives is a stochastic set of the nodes that the chosen node is currently influencing.  To address this setting, we propose BARE, a bandit strategy for which we prove a regret guarantee that scales with the detectable dimension, a problem dependent quantity that is often much smaller than the number of nodes.}

When such matrices are used, in place of dense ones, the overall complexity requirements in optimization can be significantly reduced in practice, both in terms of space and run-time.  Prompted by this observation, we study a convex optimization scheme for block-sparse recovery from linear measurements.  To obtain linear sketches, we use expander matrices, i.e., sparse matrices containing only few non-zeros per column. Hitherto, to the best of our knowledge, such algorithmic solutions have been only studied from a non-convex perspective. Our aim here is to theoretically characterize the performance of convex approaches under such setting.   Our key novelty is the expression of the recovery error in terms of the model-based norm, while assuring that solution lives in the model.  To achieve this, we show that sparse model-based matrices satisfy a group version of the null-space property.  Our experimental findings on synthetic and real applications support our claims for faster recovery in the convex setting â as opposed to using dense sensing matrices, while showing a competitive recovery performance.}

However, they are also inefficient, requiring a complete re-execution of the program on every Metropolis Hastings proposal. We present a new extension to the lightweight approach, C3, which enables efficient, incrementalized re-execution of MH proposals. C3 is based on two core ideas: transforming probabilistic programs into continuation passing style (CPS), and caching the results of function calls.  It is particularly effective at speeding up recursive programs with many local latent variables. We show that on several common models, C3 reduces proposal runtime by 20-100x, in some cases reducing runtime complexity from linear in model size to constant. We also demonstrate nearly an order of magnitude speedup on a complex inverse procedural modeling application.}

We provide simple new proofs of earlier results and derive significant novel results including that LP+TRI is tight for any model where each block is balanced or almost balanced, and a decomposition theorem that may be used to break apart complex models into smaller pieces. An almost balanced (sub-)model is one that contains no frustrated cycles except through one privileged variable.}

However, in applications the value of Î±can be unknown and/or a rate-optimal QMC rule can be unavailable. Standard practice is to employ \alpha_L-optimal QMC where the lower bound \alpha_L â¤Î±is known, but in general this does not exploit the full power of QMC.

Its empirical counterpart is an estimate from a finite dataset of samples from the distribution under consideration. However, for large-scale learning problems the empirical kernel embedding becomes infeasible to compute and approximate, constant time, solutions are necessary. Instead of the full dataset, a random subset of smaller size can be used to calculate the empirical kernel embedding, known as \emphsampling without replacement. In this work we generalize the results of (Serfling 1974) to quantify the difference between this two estimates. We derive probability inequalities for the kernel embedding and more general inequalities for Banach space valued martingales in the setting of sampling without replacement.}

Beyond inference and simulation purposes, probabilistic tools borrowed from Extreme Value Theory (EVT), such as the \textitangular measure, can also be used to design novel statistical learning methods for Anomaly Detection/ranking. This paper proposes a new algorithm based on multivariate EVT to learn how to rank observations in a high dimensional space with respect to their degree of âabnormalityâ. The procedure relies on an original dimension-reduction technique in the extreme domain that possibly produces a sparse representation of multivariate extremes and allows to gain insight into the dependence structure thereof, escaping the curse of dimensionality. The representation output by the unsupervised methodology we propose here can be combined with any Anomaly Detection technique tailored to non-extreme data. As it performs linearly with the dimension and almost linearly in the data (in O(d n \log n)), it fits to large scale problems. The approach in this paper is novel in that EVT has never been used in its multivariate version in the field of Anomaly Detection. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.}

In this paper we introduce the concept of robust-equitability and a robust-equitable dependence measure copula correlation (Ccor). This measure has the following advantages compared to existing dependence measures: it is robust to different relationship forms and robust to unequal sample sizes of different features. In contrast, existing dependence measures cannot take these factors into account simultaneously. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm our theoretical analysis, and illustrates its advantage in feature selection.}

The dependence of the sample complexity upon the number of contextual variables is logarithmic. The computational cost of the proposed algorithm with respect to the time horizon is linear. These analytical results allow the proposed algorithm to be efficient in real applications , where the number of events to process is huge, and where we expect that some contextual variables, chosen from a large set, have potentially non-linear dependencies with the rewards.

Since the agentâs behavior originates in its policy and MDP policies depend on both the stochastic system dynamics as well as the reward function, the solution of the inverse problem is significantly influenced by both. Current IRL approaches assume that if the transition model is unknown, additional samples from the systemâs dynamics are accessible, or the observed behavior provides enough samples of the systemâs dynamics to solve the inverse problem accurately. These assumptions are often not satisfied. To overcome this, we present a gradient-based IRL approach that simultaneously estimates the systemâs dynamics. By solving the combined optimization problem, our approach takes into account the bias of the demonstrations, which stems from the generating policy. The evaluation on a synthetic MDP and a transfer learning task shows improvements regarding the sample efficiency as well as the accuracy of the estimated reward functions and transition models.}

Consequently, this also enables us to estimate the underlying \phi_p, \phi_l,lâ. We derive sample complexity bounds for our scheme and also extend our analysis to include the situation where the queries are corrupted with noise â either stochastic,  or arbitrary but bounded.

Our algorithm outputs a k-clustering that provably achieves a number of agreements within a multiplicative (1-Î´)-factor from the optimal, for any desired accuracy Î´. It relies on solving a combinatorially constrained bilinear maximization on the bi-adjacency matrix of G. It runs in time exponential in k and 1/Î´, but linear in the size of the input.  Further, we show that, in the (unconstrained) BCC setting, an (1-Î´)-approximation can be achieved by O(1/Î´) clusters regardless of the size of the graph. In turn, our k-BCC algorithm implies an Efficient PTAS for the BCC objective of maximizing agreements.}

This is motivated by applications in social media monitoring and biological experimentation where such batch constraints naturally arise. This paper develops and analyzes algorithms for batch MABs and top arm identification, for both fixed confidence and fixed budget settings. Our main theoretical results show that the batch constraint does not significantly affect the sample complexity of top arm identification compared to unconstrained MAB algorithms. Alternatively, if one views a batch as the fundamental sampling unit, then the results can be interpreted as showing that the sample complexity of batch MABs can be significantly less than traditional MABs. We demonstrate the new batch MAB algorithms with simulations and in two interesting real-world applications: (i) microwell array experiments for identifying genes that are important in virus replication and (ii) finding the most active users in Twitter on a specific topic.}

We focus on a widely-used expander-based construction in the columns of the measurement matrix \mathbfX â\mathbbR^n \times p are random permutations of a sparse binary vector containing d âªn ones and n-d zeros.  We provide a sharp characterization of the number of measurements required for an information-theoretically optimal decoder, thus permitting a precise comparison to the i.i.d.Â Gaussian construction.  Our findings reveal both positive and negative results, showing that the performance nearly matches the Gaussian construction at moderate-to-high noise levels, while being worse by an arbitrarily large factor at low noise levels.}

These parameters are essential in many statistical applications involving regression diagnostics, inference,  tuning parameter selection for high-dimensional regression, and other applications, including genetics.   The estimators that we study are not new, and have been widely used for variance component estimation in linear random-effects models.  However, our analysis is new and it implies that the MLEs, which were devised for random-effects models, may also perform very well in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects, which are more commonly studied in some areas of high-dimensional statistics.  The MLEs are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal in fixed-effects models with random design, in asymptotic settings where the number of predictors ($p$) is proportional to the number of observations ($n$).  Moreover, the estimatorsâ asymptotic variance can be given explicitly in terms moments of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution.  A variety of analytical and empirical results show that the MLEs outperform other, previously proposed estimators for variance parameters in high-dimensional linear models with fixed-effects.  More broadly, the results in this paper illustrate a strategy for drawing connections between fixed- and random-effects models in high dimensions, which may be useful in other applications.}

The proposed EP method allows to train Gaussian process classifiers on very large datasets, with millions of instances, that were out of the reach of previous implementations of EP. More precisely, it can be used for (i) training in a distributed fashion where the data instances are sent to different nodes in which the required computations are carried out, and for (ii) maximizing an estimate of the marginal likelihood using a stochastic approximation of the gradient.

Then we show that by adding perturbation, we can endow irreducible functions with reducibility, based on which we propose the perturbation-reduction optimization framework. Our theoretical analysis proves that given the perturbation scales, the reducibility gain could be computed, and the performance loss has additive upper bounds. We further conduct empirical studies and the results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly accelerates existing optimization methods for irreducible submodular functions with a cost of only small performance losses.}

We give a new proof of the result for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes.}

Our empirical results show that, by allocating more resources to promising hyperparameter settings, our approach achieves comparable test accuracies an order of magnitude faster than the uniform strategy.

This work is naturally framed in the extreme bandit setting, which deals with sequentially choosing which distribution from a collection to sample in order to minimize (maximize) the single best cost (reward). Whereas the distributions in the standard bandit setting are primarily characterized by their means, a number of subtleties arise when we care about the minimal cost as opposed to the average cost. For example, there may not be a well-defined âbestâ distribution as there is in the standard bandit setting. The best distribution depends on the rewards that have been obtained and on the remaining time horizon. Whereas in the standard bandit setting, it is sensible to compare policies with an oracle which plays the single best arm, in the extreme bandit setting, there are multiple sensible oracle models. We define a sensible notion of âextreme regretâ in the extreme bandit setting, which parallels the concept of regret in the standard bandit setting. We then prove that no policy can asymptotically achieve no extreme regret. }

Unfortunately this requirement makes SP intractable beyond constraint satisfaction problems because, to perform general SP updates, one has to operate on distributions over a continuous domain. We propose an approximation scheme to efficiently extend the application of SP to marginalization in binary pairwise graphical models. Our approximate SP has O(DK\log(DK)t) complexity per iteration, where t is the complexity of BP per iteration, D is the maximum node degree and K is a resolution constant controlling the approximationâs fidelity.

Here, we suggest a finite sample approach, called ScoPe, to construct distribution-free confidence regions around the QML estimate, which have exact coverage probabilities, despite no additional assumptions about moments are made. ScoPe is inspired by the recently developed Sign-Perturbed Sums (SPS) method, which however cannot be applied in the  GARCH case. ScoPe works by perturbing the score function using randomly permuted residuals. This produces alternative samples which lead to exact confidence regions. Experiments on simulated and stock market data are also presented, and ScoPe is compared with the asymptotic theory and bootstrap approaches.}

We also provide empirical evidence on carefully designed synthetic data sets to highlight the robustness of the algorithm to recover the underlying feature subspaces, even when the average dimensionality of the features across clusters is misspecified.

  abstract = 	 {We consider the sequential Bayesian optimization problem with bandit feedback, adopting a formulation that allows for the reward function to vary with time. We model the reward function using a Gaussian process whose evolution obeys a simple Markov model.  We introduce two natural extensions of the classical Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) algorithm. The first, R-GP-UCB, resets GP-UCB at regular intervals. The second, TV-GP-UCB, instead forgets about old data in a smooth fashion.  Our main contribution comprises of novel regret bounds for these algorithms, providing an explicit characterization of the trade-off between the time horizon and the rate at which the function varies.  We illustrate the performance of the algorithms on both synthetic and real data, and we find the gradual forgetting of TV-GP-UCB to perform favorably compared to the sharp resetting of R-GP-UCB.  Moreover, both algorithms significantly outperform classical GP-UCB, since it treats stale and fresh data equally.}

The Bayes-optimal policy for this problem is the solution to a partially observable Markov decision process, but the curse of dimensionality renders the computation infeasible. Following a similar approach to the Lagrangian Relaxation technique in Adelman and Mersereau (2008), we provide a computationally tractable instance-specific upper bound on the value of this Bayes-optimal policy, which can in turn be used to bound the optimality gap of any other sub-optimal policy. In an approach similar in spirit to the Whittle index for restless multi-armed bandits, we provide an index policy for effort allocation in crowdsourcing and demonstrate numerically that it outperforms other state-of-the-art policies and performs close to optimal.}

We factorize the posterior such that the Markov blanket is conditionally independent of the network of the potential neighbours. By exploiting this blockwise decoupling, we derive analytic expressions for posterior conditionals. Subsequently, we develop an inference scheme, which makes use of the factorization. As a result, estimation of a sub-network is possible without inferring an entire network.  Since the resulting Gibbs sampler scales linearly with the number of variables, it can handle relatively large neighbourhoods. The proposed scheme results in faster convergence and superior mixing of the Markov chain than existing Bayesian network estimation techniques.}

The task is to combine these possibly conï¬icting predictions into an accurate meta-learner. Most works to date assumed perfect diversity between the different sources, a property known as conditional independence. In realistic scenarios, however, this assumption is often violated, and ensemble learners based on it can be severely sub-optimal. The key challenges we address in this paper are: (i) how to detect, in an unsupervised manner, strong violations of conditional independence; and (ii) construct a suitable meta-learner. To this end we introduce a statistical model that allows for dependencies between classifiers. Based on this model, we develop novel unsupervised methods to detect strongly dependent classifiers, better estimate their accuracies, and construct an improved meta-learner. Using both artificial and real datasets, we showcase the importance of taking classifier dependencies into account and the competitive performance of our approach.}

These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability.

We compute this quantity for several widely used semimetrics and present nearly optimal sample compression algorithms, which are then used to obtain generalization guarantees, including fast rates.  Our claim of near-optimality holds in both computational and statistical senses. When the sample has radius R and margin Î³, we show that it can be compressed down to roughly d=(R/Î³)^\dens points, and further that finding a significantly better compression is algorithmically intractable unless P=NP. This compression implies generalization via standard Occam-type arguments, to which we provide a nearly matching lower bound.}

  abstract = 	 {Complicated generative models often result in a situation where computing the likelihood of observed data is intractable, while simulating from the conditional density given a parameter value is relatively easy. Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is a paradigm that enables simulation-based posterior inference in such cases by measuring the similarity between simulated and observed data in terms of a chosen set of summary statistics. However, there is no general rule to construct sufficient summary statistics for complex models. Insufficient summary statistics will leak information, which leads to ABC algorithms yielding samples from an incorrect  posterior. In this paper, we propose a fully nonparametric ABC paradigm which circumvents the need for manually selecting summary statistics. Our approach, K2-ABC,  uses maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) to construct a dissimilarity measure between the observed and simulated data. The embedding of an empirical distribution of the data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space plays a role of the summary statistic and is sufficient whenever the corresponding kernels are characteristic. Experiments on a simulated scenario and a real-world biological problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}

We derive a sparse knowledge gradient (SpKG) decision policy based on the \ell_1-penalized regression Lasso to identify the sparsity pattern before our budget is exhausted. This policy is a unique and novel hybrid of Bayesian R&S with a frequentist learning approach. Theoretically, we provide the error bound of the posterior mean estimate, which has shown to be at the minimax optimal \sqrts\log p/n rate. Controlled experiments on both synthetic data and real application for automatically designing experiments to identify the structure of an RNA molecule show that the algorithm efficiently learns the correct set of nonzero parameters.

The two primary directions lie in (1) learning a pooling function via (two strategies of) combining of max and average pooling, and (2) learning a pooling function in the form of a tree-structured fusion of pooling filters that are themselves learned. In our experiments every generalized pooling operation we explore improves performance when used in place of average or max pooling.  We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed pooling operations provide a boost in invariance properties relative to conventional pooling and set the state of the art on several widely adopted benchmark datasets; they are also easy to implement, and can be applied within various deep neural network architectures. These benefits come with only a light increase in computational overhead during training and a very modest increase in the number of model parameters.}

Nevertheless, the convergence rate of the family can be seriously affected by the learning rate of the descent steps and deserves more serious study. The second family is based on the power method over blocks of data, but setting the block size for its existing algorithms is not an easy task. In this paper, we analyze the convergence rate of a representative algorithm with decayed learning rate (Oja and Karhunen, 1985) in the first family for the general k>1 case.

  abstract = 	 {We propose a quantization based approach for fast approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS). Each database vector is quantized in multiple subspaces via a set of codebooks, learned directly by minimizing the inner product quantization error. Then, the inner product of a query to a database vector is approximated as the sum of inner products with the subspace quantizers. Different from recently proposed LSH approaches to MIPS, the database vectors and queries do not need to be augmented in a higher dimensional feature space. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed approach, consisting of the concentration results under mild assumptions. Furthermore, if a small set of held-out queries is given at the training time, we propose a modified codebook learning procedure which further improves the accuracy.  Experimental results on a variety of datasets including those arising from deep neural networks show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art.}

  abstract = 	 {The cyclic block coordinate descent-type (CBCD-type) methods have shown remarkable computational performance for solving strongly convex minimization problems. Typical applications include many popular statistical machine learning methods such as elastic-net regression, ridge penalized logistic regression, and sparse additive regression. Existing optimization literature has shown that the CBCD-type methods attain iteration complexity of O(pâ\log(1/Îµ)),  where Îµis a pre-specified accuracy of the objective value, and p is the number of blocks. However, such iteration complexity explicitly depends on p, and therefore is at least p times worse than those of gradient descent methods. To bridge this theoretical gap, we propose an improved convergence analysis for the CBCD-type methods. In particular, we first show that for a family of quadratic minimization problems, the iteration complexity of the CBCD-type methods matches that of the GD methods in term of dependency on p (up to a \log^2 p factor). Thus our complexity bounds are sharper than the existing bounds by at least a factor of p/\log^2p. We also provide a lower bound to confirm that our improved complexity bounds are tight (up to a \log^2 p factor) if the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix do not scale with p. Finally, we generalize our analysis to other strongly convex minimization problems beyond quadratic ones.}

It has also been well recognized that the matrix factorization framework might offer more flexibility on pursuing underlying structures of the data. In this paper, we propose to learn structured LRR by factorizing the nuclear norm regularized matrix, which leads to our proposed non-convex formulation NLRR.  Interestingly, this formulation of NLRR provides a general framework for unifying a variety of popular algorithms including LRR, dictionary learning, robust principal component analysis, sparse subspace clustering, etc. Several variants of NLRR are also proposed, for example, to promote sparsity while preserving low-rankness. We design a practical algorithm for NLRR and its variants, and establish theoretical guarantee for the stability of the solution and the convergence of the algorithm. Perhaps surprisingly, the  computational and memory cost of NLRR can be reduced  by roughly one order of magnitude compared to the cost of LRR. Experiments on extensive simulations and real datasets confirm the robustness of efficiency of NLRR and the variants.}

While highly scalable optimization methods exist for sparse Gaussian graphical model estimation, state-of-the-art methods for conditional Gaussian graphical models are not efficient enough and more importantly, fail due to memory constraints for very large problems. In this paper, we propose a new optimization procedure based on a Newton method that efficiently iterates over two sub-problems, leading to drastic improvement in computation time compared to the previous methods. We then extend our method to scale to large problems under memory constraints, using block coordinate descent to limit memory usage while achieving fast convergence. Using synthetic and genomic data, we show that our methods can solve problems with millions of variables and tens of billions of parameters to high accuracy on a single machine.}

It was shown that under mild conditions, with high probability no two points from different subspaces are clustered together. Such guarantee, however, is not sufficient for the clustering to be correct, due to the notorious âgraph connectivity problemâ [15]. In this paper, we investigate the graph connectivity problem for noisy sparse sub-space clustering and show that a simple post-processing procedure is capable of delivering consistent clustering under certain âgeneral positionâ or ârestricted eigenvalueâ assumptions. We also show that our condition is almost tight with adversarial noise perturbation by constructing a counter-example. These results provide the first exact clustering guarantee of noisy SSC for subspaces of dimension greater then 3.}

We derive the smoothing equations, analyze the computational cost, and show smoothing consistency.

In this paper, we study the expressive power and learnability of Graphical Event Models (GEMs) â the analogue of directed graphical models for multivariate temporal point processes. In particular, we describe a set of Graphical Event Models (GEMs) and show that this class can universally approximate any smooth multivariate temporal point process.

Our consistency results demonstrate the possibility of learning about both qualitative and quantitative dependencies from rich event stream data.}

Our online algorithm inherits the advantages of REPS-RKHS, including the ability to learn non-parametric control policies for infinite horizon continuous MDPs with high- dimensional sensory representations. Different from the original REPS-RKHS algorithm which is based on batch learning, the proposed online algorithm updates the model in an online fashion and thus is able to capture and respond to rapid changes in the system dynamics. In addition, the online update operation takes constant time (i.e., independent of the sample size n), which is much more efficient computationally and allows the policy to be continuously revised. Experiments on different domains are conducted and results show that our online algorithm outperforms the original algorithm.}

(1) By applying two different types of approximation, a replacing approximation by using a Bayesian network  and a Bethe type of approximation based on the cluster variation method, to two different parts of the true log-likelihood function of the DBM, pretraining can be derived from a variational approximation of the original maximum likelihood estimation.

Many MKL approaches use linear combination of base kernels, resulting in somewhat limited feature representations. Several non-linear MKL formulations were proposed recently. They provide much higher dimensional feature spaces, and, therefore, richer representations. However, these methods often lead to non-convex optimization and to intractable number of optimization parameters.  In this paper, we propose a new non-linear MKL method that utilizes nuclear norm regularization and leads to convex optimization problem. The proposed Nuclear-norm-Constrained MKL (NuC-MKL) algorithm converges faster, and requires smaller number of calls to an SVM solver, as compared to other competing methods. Moreover, the number of the model support vectors in our approach is usually much smaller, as compared to other methods. This suggests that our algorithm is more resilient to overfitting. We test our algorithm on several known benchmarks, and show that it equals or outperforms the state-of-the-art MKL methods on all these data sets.}

We assume in this work that we have prior knowledge on these features. To leverage this side-information, we propose to use the Wasserstein (\textita.k.a. earth moverâs or optimal transport) distance as the fitting error between each original point and its reconstruction, and we propose scalable algorithms to to so. Our methods build upon Fenchel duality and entropic regularization of Wasserstein distances, which improves not only speed but also computational stability.

  abstract = 	 {The popularity of Bayesian optimization methods for efficient exploration of parameter spaces has lead to a series of papers applying Gaussian processes as surrogates in the optimization of functions. However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly effective heuristic based on an estimate of the functionâs Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interactionâlocal repulsionâat negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.}

We provide theoretical analysis to show that our framework is guaranteed to converge for a large collection of loss functions (e.g. Hinge, Logistic, L2, L1, and \varepsilon-insensitive) which enables the proposed algorithm to perform both classification and regression tasks without hurting the ideal convergence rate O\left(\frac1T\right) of the standard Stochastic Gradient Descent.

Famously, the worst-case cost of exact nonparametric regression grows cubically with the data-set size; but a growing number of approximations have been developed that estimate good solutions at lower cost. These algorithms typically return point estimators, without measures of uncertainty. Leveraging recent results casting elementary linear algebra operations as probabilistic inference, we propose a new approximate method for nonparametric least-squares that affords a probabilistic uncertainty estimate over the error between the approximate and exact least-squares solution (this is not the same as the posterior variance of the associated Gaussian process regressor). This allows estimating the error of the least-squares solution on a subset of the data relative to the full-data solution.  The uncertainty can be used to control the computational effort invested in the approximation. Our algorithm has linear cost in the data-set size, and a simple formal form, so that it can be implemented with a few lines of code in programming languages with linear algebra functionality.}

Using the concave-convex procedure, we then develop a scalable message-passing algorithm. Empirically, our approach is highly scalable and accurate for large graphs, more than an order-of-magnitude faster than a generic optimization solver, and is guaranteed to converge unlike the previous message-passing approach NLBP that fails in several loopy graphs.}

We first formulate a deterministic annealing approach for the generic class of conditionally conjugate exponential family models. This algorithm uses a temperature parameter that deterministically deforms the objective and reduces this parameter over the course of the optimization. A well-known drawback in annealing is the choice of the annealing schedule. We therefore introduce variational tempering, a variational algorithm that introduces a temperature latent variable to the model. In contrast to related work in the Markov chain Monte Carlo literature, this algorithm results in adaptive annealing schedules. Lastly, we develop local variational tempering, which assigns a latent temperature to each data point; this allows for dynamic annealing that varies across data. Compared to the traditional VI, all proposed approaches find improved predictive likelihoods on held-out data.}

The worker machines of mspg operate asynchronously as long as they are not too far apart, and they communicate efficiently through a dedicated parameter server. Theoretically, we provide a rigorous analysis of the various convergence properties of mspg, and a salient feature of our analysis is its seamless generality that allows both nonsmooth and nonconvex functions. Under mild conditions, we prove the whole iterate sequence of mspg converges to a critical point (which is optimal under convexity assumptions). We further provide an economical implementation of mspg, completely bypassing the need of keeping a local full model. We confirm our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.}

For inferring the full posterior distribution we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), which conveniently extends the analytical gradient-based GPR learning by guiding the sampling with the gradients.

  abstract = 	 {A popular class of algorithms for convex optimization and online learning with bandit feedback rely on constructing noisy gradient estimates, which are then used in place of the actual gradients in appropriately adjusted first-order algorithms. Depending on the properties of the function to be optimized and the nature of ânoiseâ in the bandit feedback, the bias and variance of gradient estimates exhibit various tradeoffs. In this paper we propose a novel framework that replaces the specific gradient estimation methods with an abstract oracle model. With the help of the new framework we unify previous works, reproducing their results in a clean and concise fashion, while, perhaps more importantly, the framework also allows us to formally show that to achieve the optimal root-n rate either the algorithms that use existing gradient estimators, or the proofs have to go beyond what exists today.}

With these axes pre-computed using fast singular value decomposition, GEODE easily scales to high dimensional problems while providing uncertainty characterization. The model is also capable of imputing missing data and dynamically deleting redundant dimensions. Finally, we generalize GEODE by mixing it across a dyadic clustering tree. Both simulation studies and real world data applications show superior performance of GEODE in terms of robustness and computational efficiency.}

Empirical results on numerous synthetic and real-world text datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, for modelling high dimensional sparse data and co-clustering.

A common approach is based on using Gaussian Process (GP) to model the objective function. Applying GP to higher dimensional settings is generally difficult due to the curse of dimensionality for nonparametric regression. Existing works makes strong assumptions such as the function is low-dimensional embedding (Wang et al., 2013) or is axis-aligned additive (Kandasamy et al., 2015). In this pa- per, we generalize the existing assumption to a projected-additive assumption. Our generalization provides the benefits of i) greatly increasing the space of functions that can be modeled by our approach, which covers the previous works (Wang et al., 2013; Kandasamy et al., 2015) as special cases, and ii) efficiently handling the learning in a larger model space. We prove that the regret for projected-additive functions has only linear dependence on the number of dimensions in this general setting. Directly using projected-additive GP (Gilboa et al., 2013) to BO results in a non-box constraint, which is not easy to optimize. We tackle this problem by proposing a restricted-projection-pursuit GP for BO. We conduct experiments on synthetic examples and scientific and hyper-parameter tuning tasks in many cases. Our method outperforms existing approaches even when the function does not meet the projected additive assumption. Last, we study the validity of the additive and projected-additive assumption in practice.}

As in the case of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), non-stationary algorithms are shown to exhibit better performance bounds compared to their stationary counterparts. The obtained bounds are generically composed of three terms: 1) a dependency on Î³(discount factor), 2) a concentrability coefficient and 3) a propagation error term. This error, depending on the algorithm, can be caused by a regression step, a policy evaluation step or a best-response evaluation step. As a second contribution, we empirically demonstrate, on generic MGs (called Garnets), that non-stationary algorithms outperform their stationary counterparts. In addition, it is shown that their performance mostly depends on the nature of the propagation error. Indeed, algorithms where the error is due to the evaluation of a best-response are penalized (even if they exhibit better concentrability coefficients and dependencies on Î³) compared to those suffering from a regression error.}

We obtain more robust Markov chains, which often mix more quickly.}

Since the estimation of s-sparse signals with completely independent covariates also requires O(s \log p) measurements, this shows that by using OWL regularization, we pay no price (in the number of measurements) for the presence of strongly correlated covariates.}

However, when several sparse principal components are computed, the interpretation of the selected variables may be difficult since each axis has its own sparsity pattern and has to be interpreted separately. To overcome this drawback, we propose a Bayesian procedure that allows to obtain several sparse components with the same sparsity pattern. To this end, using Roweisâ probabilistic interpretation of PCA and an isotropic Gaussian prior on the loading matrix, we provide the first exact computation of the marginal likelihood of a Bayesian PCA model. In order to avoid the drawbacks of discrete model selection, we propose a simple relaxation of our framework which allows to find a path of models using a variational expectation-maximization algorithm. The exact marginal likelihood can eventually be maximized over this path, relying on Occamâs razor to select the relevant variables. Since the sparsity pattern is common to all components, we call this approach globally sparse probabilistic PCA (GSPPCA). Its usefulness is illustrated on synthetic data sets and on several real unsupervised feature selection problems.}

  abstract = 	 {Bayesian methods are appealing in their flexibility in modeling complex data and ability in capturing uncertainty in parameters. However, when Bayesâ rule does not result in tractable closed-form, most approximate inference algorithms lack either scalability or rigorous guarantees. To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet provable algorithm, Particle Mirror Descent (PMD), to iteratively approximate the posterior density.  PMD is inspired by stochastic functional mirror descent where one descends in the density space using a small batch of data points at each iteration, and by particle filtering where one uses samples to approximate a function. We prove result of the first kind that, with m particles, PMD provides a posterior density estimator that converges in terms of KL-divergence to the true posterior in rate O(1/\sqrtm). We demonstrate competitive empirical performances of PMD compared to several approximate inference algorithms in mixture models, logistic regression, sparse Gaussian processes and latent Dirichlet allocation on large scale datasets.}

  abstract = 	 {Feature selection is an important technique for alleviating the curse of dimensionality. Unsupervised feature selection is more challenging than its supervised counterpart due to the lack of labels. In this paper, we present an effective method, Stochastic Neighbor-preserving Feature Selection (SNFS), for selecting discriminative features in unsupervised setting. We employ the concept of stochastic neighbors and select the features that can best preserve such stochastic neighbors by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence between neighborhood distributions. The proposed approach measures feature utility jointly in a non-linear way and discriminative features can be selected due to its âpush-pullâ property. We develop an efficient algorithm for optimizing the objective function based on projected quasi-Newton method. Moreover, few existing methods provide ways for determining the optimal number of selected features and this hampers their utility in practice. Our approach is equipped with a guideline for choosing the number of features, which provides nearly optimal performance in our experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly on several real-world datasets.}

However, classical convex surrogates can only tightly bound modular loss functions, submodular functions or supermodular functions separately while maintaining polynomial time computation. In this work, a novel generic convex surrogate for general non-modular loss functions is introduced, which provides for the first time a tractable solution for loss functions that are neither supermodular nor submodular. This convex surrogate is based on a submodular-supermodular decomposition for which the existence and uniqueness is proven in this paper. It takes the sum of two convex surrogates that separately bound the supermodular component and the submodular component using slack-rescaling and the Lovasz hinge, respectively. It is further proven that this surrogate is convex, piecewise linear, an extension of the loss function, and for which subgradient computation is polynomial time. Empirical results are reported on a non-submodular loss based on the Sorensen-Dice difference function, and a real-world face track dataset with tens of thousands of frames, demonstrating the improved performance, efficiency, and scalability of the novel convex surrogate.}

Most existing work on high-dimensional estimation of exponential family graphical models, including Gaussian graphical models and Ising models, is focused on consistent model selection. However, these results do not characterize uncertainty in the estimated structure and are of limited value to scientists who worry whether their findings will be reproducible and if the estimated edges are present in the model due to random chance. In this paper, we propose a novel estimator for edge parameters in an exponential family graphical models. We prove that the estimator is \sqrtn-consistent and asymptotically Normal.  This result allows us to construct confidence intervals for edge parameters, as well as, hypothesis tests. We establish our results under conditions that are typically assumed in the literature for consistent estimation. However, we do not require that the estimator consistently recovers the graph structure. In particular, we prove that the asymptotic distribution of the estimator is robust to model selection mistakes and uniformly valid for a large number of data-generating processes. We illustrate validity of our estimator through extensive simulation studies.}

The zero-temperature limit gives a novel stochastic optimization method with adaptive element-wise momentum weights, while conventional optimization methods only have a shared, static momentum weight.

Yet, kernel methods often require the user to select a predefined kernel to build an estimator with. However, there is often little reason for the common practice of selecting a kernel a priori. Even if a universal approximating kernel is selected, the quality of the finite sample estimator may be greatly affected by the choice of kernel. Furthermore, when directly applying kernel methods, one typically needs to compute a N \times N Gram matrix of pairwise kernel evaluations to work with a dataset of N instances. The computation of this Gram matrix precludes the direct application of kernel methods on large datasets, and makes kernel learning especially difficult. In this paper we introduce Bayesian nonparmetric kernel-learning (BaNK), a generic, data-driven framework for scalable learning of kernels. BaNK places a nonparametric prior on the spectral distribution of random frequencies allowing it to both learn kernels and scale to large datasets. We show that this framework can be used for large scale regression and classification tasks. Furthermore, we show that BaNK outperforms several other scalable approaches for kernel learning on a variety of real world datasets.}

In the spirit of random projections, the projection preserves (with high probability) key properties of the target distribution. We show that information projections can be combined with random projections to obtain provable guarantees on the quality of the approximation obtained, regardless of the complexity of the original model. We demonstrate empirically that augmenting mean field with a random projection step dramatically improves partition function and marginal probability estimates, both on synthetic and real world data.}

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for such domains is challenging due to the intractability of computing partition functions. One can resort to approximate marginal inference in conjunction with gradient descent, but such algorithms require careful tuning. Alternatively, in frameworks such as the structured support vector machine (SVM-Struct), discriminative functions are learned by iteratively applying efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoders. We introduce MLE-Struct, a method for learning discrete exponential family models using the Bethe approximation to the partition function. Remarkably, this problem can also be reduced to iterative (MAP) decoding. This connection emerges by combining the Bethe approximation with the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm on a convex dual objective, which circumvents the intractable partition function. Our method can learn both generative and conditional models and is substantially faster and easier to implement than existing MLE approaches while still relying on the same black-box interface to MAP decoding as SVM-Struct. We perform competitively on problems in denoising, segmentation, matching, and new datasets of roommate assignments and news and financial time series.}

For example, when modeling documents with a two-level side-information (documents being at level-zero), level-one may represent (one or more) authors associated with each document and level-two may represent affiliations of each author. The model easily generalizes to more than two levels (or taxonomy/ontology of arbitrary depth). Our model can learn embeddings of entities present at each level in the data/side-information hierarchy (e.g., documents, authors, affiliations, in the previous example), with appropriate sharing of information across levels. The model also enjoys full local conjugacy, facilitating efficient Gibbs sampling for model inference. Inference cost scales in the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix, which is especially appealing for real-world massive but sparse matrices.

Computational cost of our models scales in the number of positive triplets, which makes it easy to scale to massive real-world multi-relational data sets, which are usually extremely sparse.

This arises when a population of individuals behave independently according to a Markov chain, but individual sample paths cannot be observed due to limitations of the observation process or the need to protect privacy. Instead, only population-level counts of the number of individuals in each state at each time step are available. When these counts are exact, a conditional least squares (CLS) estimator is known to be consistent and asymptotically normal. We initiate the study of method of moments estimators for this problem to handle the more realistic case when observations are additionally corrupted by noise. We show that CLS can be interpreted as a simple âplug-inâ method of moments estimator. However, when observations are noisy, it is not consistent because it fails to account for additional variance introduced by the noise. We develop a new, simpler method of moments estimator that bypasses this problem and is consistent under noisy observations.}

We propose iterative methods that solve global sub-problems over an entire distributed dataset.  This is possible using transpose reduction strategies that allow a single node to solve least-squares over massive datasets without putting all the data in one place.  This results in simple iterative methods that avoid the expensive inner loops required for consensus methods.  We analyze the convergence rates of the proposed schemes and demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by fitting linear classifiers and sparse linear models to large datasets using a distributed implementation with up to 20,000 cores in far less time than previous approaches.}

However, their training is a non convex optimization problem. Here we address this difficulty by turning to "improper learning" of neural nets. In other words, we learn a classifier that is not a neural net but is competitive with the best neural net model given a sufficient number of training examples. Our approach relies on a novel kernel which integrates over the set of possible neural models. It turns out that the corresponding integral can be evaluated in closed form via a simple recursion. The learning problem is then an SVM with this kernel, and a global optimum can thus be found efficiently. We also provide sample complexity results which depend on the stability of the optimal neural net.}

In this work, we modify the standard Bayesian optimization framework in a principled way to allow for unconstrained exploration of the search space. We introduce a new alternative method and compare it to a volume doubling baseline on two common synthetic benchmarking test functions.

In addition, we present a new algorithm \rm mergepool that have better complexity when the number of distinct entries d in the vector c is small, the simplex being one such example, with c=(1,0,0,\dotsc,0)^T and d=2. \rm mergepool runs in O(n \log d) for certain popular Bregman divergence measures and requires O((n \log d) \log \fracU Îµ) to find Îµ-close solutions for general uniformly separable Bregman divergences, where U is a bound on the width of the interval containing the dual solution components. These estimates matches or improves best known bounds for all Bregman projection problems onto various permutahedra, including recent results for projection onto the simplex. The same complexity bounds apply to signed permutahedra, a class that includes the \ell_1-ball as a special case.

Specifically, we employ score function tensors of the input  and compute their cross-correlation with the response variable.   We establish that the decomposition of this tensor consistently recovers the parameters, under mild non-degeneracy conditions.

To extract the most insights from a dataset, the analyst typically needs to engage in an iterative process of adaptive data analysis. The choice of analytics to be performed next depends on the results of the previous analyses on the same data. It is commonly recognized that such adaptivity (also called researcher degrees of freedom), even if well-intentioned, can lead to false discoveries, contributing to the crisis of reproducibility in science. In this paper, we propose a general information-theoretic framework to quantify and provably bound the bias of arbitrary adaptive analysis process. We prove that our mutual information based bound is tight in natural models. We show how this framework can give rigorous insights into when commonly used feature selection protocols (e.g. rank selection) do and do not lead to biased estimation. We also show how recent insights from differential privacy emerge from this framework when the analyst is assumed to be adversarial, though our bounds applies in more general settings. We illustrate our results with simple simulations.}

We examine three types of sparsification: spectral sparsification, which can be seen as the result of sampling edges from the graph with probabilities proportional to their effective resistances, and two simpler sparsifiers, which sample edges uniformly from the graph, either globally or locally.

While the problem has well-developed convex relaxation with approximation and recovery guarantees, it has number of variables grows quadratically with the number of samples. Therefore, state-of-the-art methods can hardly handle more than 10^4 samples (i.e. 10^8 variables).

However, it is tailored to high dimensional data, i.e., when d â«k . We analyze Lloydâs algorithm for general d without using the spectral projection, which leads to a weaker assumption in the case d < k.

To address these two issues we propose an iterative estimation procedure termed averaged implicit SGD (AI-SGD). For statistical efficiency AI-SGD employs averaging of the iterates, which achieves the Cramer-Rao bound under strong convexity, i.e., it is asymptotically an optimal unbiased estimator of the true parameter value. For numerical stability AI-SGD employs an implicit update at each iteration, which is similar to updates performed by proximal operators in optimization. In practice, AI-SGD achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art procedures. Furthermore, it is more stable than averaging procedures that do not employ proximal updates, and is simple to implement as it requires fewer tunable hyperparameters than procedures that do employ proximal updates.}

Recent advances on the topic of causal inference based on tools from statistical estimation and machine learning have resulted in practical algorithms for causal inference. Causal inference has the potential to have significant impact on medical research, prevention and control of diseases, and identifying factors that impact economic changes to name just a few. However, these promising applications for causal inference are often ones that involve sensitive or personal data of users that need to be kept private (e.g., medical records, personal finances, etc). Therefore, there is a need for the development of causal inference methods that preserve data privacy. We study the problem of inferring causality using the current, popular causal inference framework, the additive noise model (ANM) while simultaneously ensuring privacy of the users. Our framework provides differential privacy guarantees for a variety of ANM variants. We run extensive experiments, and demonstrate that our techniques are practical and easy to implement.}

In this paper, we present a parallelization scheme for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods based on spectral clustering of the underlying state space, generalizing earlier work on parallelization of MCMC methods by state space partitioning. We show empirically that this approach speeds up MCMC sampling for multimodal distributions and that it can be usefully applied in greater generality than several related algorithms. Our algorithm converges under reasonable conditions to an âoptimalâ MCMC algorithm. We also show that our approach can be asymptotically far more efficient than naive parallelization, even in situations such as completely flat target distributions where no unique optimal algorithm exists. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical bounds to provide practical guidance on the choice of tuning parameters.}

But their applicability to large sets is hindered by expensive cubic-complexity matrix operations for basic tasks such as sampling. In light of this, we propose a new method for approximate sampling from discrete k-DPPs. Our method takes advantage of the diversity property of subsets sampled from a DPP, and proceeds in two stages: first it constructs coresets for the ground set of items; thereafter, it efficiently samples subsets based on the constructed coresets. As opposed to previous approaches, our algorithm aims to minimize the total variation distance to the original distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets indicate that our sampling algorithm works efficiently on large data sets, and yields more accurate samples than previous approaches.}

The E-step in this algorithm requires posterior samples, which are already generated in current learning schema. For the M-step, we augment with Polya-Gamma (PG) random variables to give an analytic updating scheme. We show relationships to standard learning approaches by deriving stochastic gradient ascent in the MCEM framework. We apply the proposed methods to both binary and count data. Experimental results show that MCEM improves the convergence speed and often improves hold-out performance over existing learning methods. Our approach is readily generalized to other recognition networks.}

In many applications such as sensor networks and proteomics  it is often expensive to obtain samples from all the variables involved simultaneously. For instance, this might involve the synchronization of a large number of sensors or the tagging of a large number of proteins.  To address this important issue, we initiate the study of a novel graphical model selection problem, where the goal is to optimize the total number of scalar samples obtained by allowing the collection of samples from only subsets of the variables. We propose a general paradigm for graphical model selection where feedback is used to guide the sampling to high degree vertices, while obtaining only few samples from the ones with the low degrees. We instantiate this framework with two specific active learning algorithms, one of which makes mild assumptions but is computationally expensive, while the other is computationally more efficient but requires stronger (nevertheless standard) assumptions. Whereas the sample complexity of passive algorithms is typically a function of the maximum degree of the graph, we show that the sample complexity of our algorithms is provably smaller and that it depends on a novel local complexity measure that is akin to the average degree of the graph. We finally demonstrate the efficacy of our framework via simulations.}

Techniques such as the Nystrom method and random feature maps can help towards this goal, but they do not explicitly maintain the basis vectors in a stream and take more space than desired.  We propose a new approach for streaming KPCA which maintains a small set of basis elements in a stream, requiring space only logarithmic in n, and also improves the dependence on the error parameter.  Our technique combines together random feature maps with recent advances in matrix sketching, it has guaranteed spectral norm error bounds with respect to the original kernel matrix, and it compares favorably in practice to state-of-the-art approaches.}

In this paper we aim to revisit some of the older approaches to training the RBF networks from a more modern perspective. Specifically, we analyze  two common regularization procedures, one based on the square norm of the coefficients in the network and another on using centers obtained by k-means clustering. We show that both of these RBF methods can be recast as certain data-dependent kernels. We provide a theoretical analysis of these methods as well as a number of experimental results, pointing out very competitive experimental performance as well as certain advantages over the standard kernel methods in terms of both flexibility (incorporating of unlabeled data)  and computational complexity.

In this context, we analyze the statistical and computational properties of the proposed method. Theoretical results are complemented and validated by a thorough experimental analysis.}

There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term these more general models "Chained Gaussian Processes": the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on a range of likelihood functions.}

We propose a new method, SILO, for fitting prediction-time local models that uses supervised neighborhoods that adapt to the local shape of the regression surface. To learn such neighborhoods, we use a weight function between points derived from random forests. We prove the consistency of SILO, and demonstrate through simulations and real data that our method works well in both the serial and distributed settings. In the latter case, SILO learns the weighting function in a divide-and-conquer manner, entirely avoiding communication at training time.}

This is particularly attractive since it means that learning an SPN from data always yields a tractable model for inference. However, existing parameter learning algorithms for SPNs operate in batch mode and do not scale easily to large datasets. In this work, we explore online algorithms to ensure that parameter learning can also be done tractably with respect to the amount of data.  More specifically, we propose a new Bayesian moment matching (BMM) algorithm that operates naturally in an online fashion and that can be easily distributed.

  abstract = 	 {In this work we develop and study a novel online robust principal componentsâ analysis (RPCA) algorithm based on the recently introduced ReProCS framework. Our algorithm significantly improves upon the original ReProCS algorithm and it also returns even more accurate offline estimates. The key contribution of this work is a correctness result for this algorithm under relatively mild assumptions. By using extra (but usually valid) assumptions we are able to remove one important limitation of batch RPCA results and two important limitations of a recent result for ReProCS for online RPCA. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first correctness results for online RPCA.}

  abstract = 	 {We propose an optimization framework for nonconvex problems based on majorization-minimization that is particularity well-suited for parallel computing. It reduces the optimization of a high dimensional nonconvex objective function to successive optimizations of locally tight and convex upper bounds which are additively separable into low dimensional objectives. The original problem is then broken into simpler and parallel tasks, while guaranteeing the monotonic reduction of the original objective function and convergence to a local minimum. This framework also allows one to restrict the upper bound to a local dynamic convex domain, so that the bound is better matched to the local curvature of the objective function, resulting in accelerated convergence. We test the proposed framework on a nonconvex support vector machine based on a sigmoid loss function and on nonconvex penalized logistic regression.}

  abstract = 	 {The biggest limitation of probabilistic graphical models is the complexity of inference, which is often intractable.  An appealing alternative is to use tractable probabilistic models, such as arithmetic circuits (ACs) and sum-product networks (SPNs), in which marginal and conditional queries can be answered efficiently.  In this paper, we present the first discriminative structure learning algorithm for ACs, DACLearn (Discriminative AC Learner).  Like previous work on generative structure learning, DACLearn finds a log-linear model with conjunctive features, using the size of an equivalent AC representation as a learning bias.  Unlike previous work, DACLearn optimizes conditional likelihood, resulting in a more accurate conditional distribution.  DACLearn also learns much more compact ACs than generative methods, since it does not need to represent a consistent distribution over the evidence variables.  To ensure efficiency, DACLearn uses novel initialization and search heuristics to drastically reduce the number of feature evaluations required to learn an accurate model.  In experiments on 20 benchmark domains, we find that our DACLearn learns models that are more accurate and compact than other tractable generative and discriminative methods.}

  abstract = 	 {Based on Î±-stable random projections with small Î±, we develop a simple algorithm for compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) by utilizing only the signs (i.e., 1-bit) of the measurements.  Using only 1-bit information of the measurements  results in substantial cost reduction  in collection, storage, communication, and decoding for compressed sensing.  The proposed algorithm is efficient in that the decoding procedure requires only one scan of the coordinates. Our analysis can precisely show that, for a K-sparse signal of length N, 12.3K\log N/Î´measurements (where Î´is the confidence) would be sufficient for recovering the support and the signs of the signal. While the method is highly robust against typical measurement noises, we also provide the analysis of the scheme under   random flipping of the signs of  measurements.    Compared to the well-known work on 1-bit marginal regression (which can also be viewed as a one-scan method), the proposed algorithm requires orders of magnitude fewer measurements. Compared to  1-bit Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) (which is not a one-scan algorithm), our method is still significantly more accurate. Furthermore, the proposed method is reasonably robust against random sign flipping while IHT is known to be very sensitive to this type of noise.}
