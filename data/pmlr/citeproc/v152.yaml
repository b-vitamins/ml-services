- title: 'Approximation to object conditional validity with inductive conformal predictors'
  abstract: 'Conformal predictors are machine learning algorithms that output prediction sets that have a  guarantee of marginal validity for finite samples with minimal distributional assumptions. This is a property that makes conformal predictors useful for machine learning tasks where we  require reliable predictions. It would also be desirable to achieve conditional validity in the same  setting, in the sense that validity of the prediction intervals remains true regardless of conditioning  on any particular property of the object of the prediction. Unfortunately, it has been shown that  such conditional validity is impossible to guarantee for non-trivial prediction problems for finite  samples. In this article, instead of trying to achieve a strong conditional validity guarantee, an  \emph{approximation} to conditional validity is considered and measured empirically. A new algorithm is  introduced to do this by iteratively adjusting a conformity measure to deviations from object  conditional validity measured in the training data. Experimental results are provided for three data  sets that demonstrate (1) in real world machine learning tasks, lack of conditional validity is a  measurable problem and (2) that the proposed algorithm is effective at alleviating this problem.'

- title: 'Mondrian conformal predictive distributions'
  abstract: 'The distributions output by a standard (non-normalized) conformal predictive system all  have the same shape but differ in location, while a normalized conformal predictive system outputs  distributions that differ also in shape, through rescaling. An approach to further increasing the  flexibility of the framework is proposed, called \emph{Mondrian conformal predictive distributions}, which  are (standard or normalized) conformal predictive distributions formed from multiple Mondrian  categories. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with an application to regression  forests. By forming categories through binning of the predictions, it is shown that for this model  class, the use of Mondrian conformal predictive distributions significantly outperforms the use of  both standard and normalized conformal predictive distributions with respect to the continuous- ranked probability score. It is further shown that the use of Mondrian conformal predictive  distributions results in as tight prediction intervals as produced by normalized conformal regressors,  while improving upon the point predictions of the underlying regression forest.'

The bound holds w.r.t. the class of softmax  linear predictors. We then show that the bound is asymptotically matched by the Bayesian universal  algorithm.'

- title: 'Shapley-value based inductive conformal prediction'
  abstract: 'Shapley values of individual instances were recently proposed for the problem of data  valuation. They were defined as the average marginal instance contributions to the performance of a  given predictor. In this paper we propose to use Shapley values of individual instances as conformity  scores. To compute these values efficiently and exactly we employ a standard algorithm based on  nearest neighbor classification and propose a variant of this algorithm for clustered data. Both  variants are used for computing Shapley conformity scores for inductive conformal predictors. The  experiments show that the Shapley-value conformity scores result in smaller prediction sets for  significance level $\epsilon \leq 0.1$ compared with those produced by standard conformity scores  (i.e. similarity between true and predicted output values).'

- title: 'Conformal uncertainty sets for robust optimization'
  abstract: 'Decision-making under uncertainty is hugely important for any decisions sensitive to  perturbations in observed data. One method of incorporating uncertainty into making optimal  decisions is through robust optimization, which minimizes the worst-case scenario over some  \emph{uncertainty set}. We connect conformal prediction regions to robust optimization, providing finite  sample valid and conservative ellipsoidal uncertainty sets, aptly named conformal uncertainty sets.  In pursuit of this connection we explicitly define Mahalanobis distance as a potential conformity  score in full conformal prediction. We also compare the coverage and optimization performance of  conformal uncertainty sets, specifically generated with Mahalanobis distance, to traditional  ellipsoidal uncertainty sets on a collection of simulated robust optimization examples.'

- title: 'Synergy conformal prediction'
  abstract: 'Conformal prediction is a machine learning methodology that produces valid prediction  regions. Ensembles of conformal predictors have been proposed to improve the informational  efficiency of inductive conformal predictors by combining p-values, however, the validity of such  methods has been an open problem. We introduce synergy conformal prediction which is an  ensemble method that combines monotonic conformity scores, and is capable of producing valid  prediction intervals. We study the applicability in three scenarios; where data is partitioned, where  an ensemble of different machine learning methods is used, and where data is unpartitioned. We  evaluate the method on 10 data sets and show that the synergy conformal predictor produces valid  prediction intervals that on partitioned data performs well compared to the most efficient model  trained on individual partitions, making it a viable approach for federated settings when data cannot  be pooled. We also show that our method has advantages over current ensembles of conformal  predictors by producing valid and efficient results on unpartitioned data, and that it is less  computationally demanding.'

- title: 'Calibrating multi-class models'
  abstract: 'Predictive models communicating algorithmic confidence are very informative, but only  if well-calibrated and sharp, i.e., providing accurate probability estimates adjusted for each instance.  While almost all machine learning algorithms are able to produce probability estimates, these are  often poorly calibrated, thus requiring external calibration. For multiclass problems, external  calibration has typically been done using one-vs-all or all-vs-all schemes, thus adding to the  computational complexity, but also making it impossible to analyze and inspect the predictive  models. In this paper, we suggest a novel approach for calibrating inherently multi-class models.  Instead of providing a probability distribution over all labels, the estimation is of the probability that  the class label predicted by the underlying model is correct. In an extensive empirical study, it is  shown that the suggested approach, when applied to both Platt scaling and Venn-Abers, is able to  improve the probability estimates from decision trees, random forests and extreme gradient  boosting.'

  abstract: 'Conformal testing is a way of testing the IID assumption based on conformal prediction.  The topic of this paper is experimental evaluation of the performance of conformal testing in a  model situation in which IID binary observations generated from a Bernoulli distribution are  followed by IID binary observations generated from another Bernoulli distribution, with the  parameters of the distributions and changepoint known or unknown. Existing conformal test  martingales can be used for this task and work well in simple cases, but their efficiency can be  improved greatly.'

- title: 'Impact of model-agnostic nonconformity functions on efficiency of conformal classifiers: an extensive study'
  abstract: 'The property of conformal predictors to guarantee the required accuracy rate makes this  framework attractive in various practical applications. However, this property is achieved at a price  of reduction in precision. In the case of conformal classification, the system can output multiple class  labels instead of one. It is also known, that the choice of nonconformity function has a major impact  on the efficiency of conformal classifiers. Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic  nonconformity functions result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural  Network-based conformal classifier, the \emph{inverse probability} (or hinge loss) allows minimizing the  average number of predicted labels, and \emph{margin} results in a larger fraction of singleton predictions.  In this work, we aim to further extend this study. We perform an experimental evaluation using 8  different classification algorithms and discuss when the previously observed relationship holds or  not. Additionally, we propose a successful method to combine the properties of these two  nonconformity functions.'

- title: 'Using inductive conformal martingales for addressing concept drift in data stream classification'
  abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate the use of Inductive Conformal Martingales (ICM) with the  histogram betting function for detecting the occurrence of concept drift (CD) in data stream  classification. A change in the data distribution will almost surely affect the performance of our  classification model resulting in false predictions. Therefore, a reliable and fast detection of the  point at which a CD occurs, allows effective retraining of the model to recover accuracy. Our  approach is based on ICM with the histogram betting function, which is much more computationally  efficient than alternative ICM approaches. To accelerate the process of detecting CD we also modify  the ICM and examine different parameters of the histogram betting function. We evaluate the  proposed approach on three benchmark datasets, namely STAGGER, SEA and ELEC, presenting  different measures of its performance and comparing it with existing methods in the literature.'

Our method, based  on conformal prediction, is general and can be applied on top of any modern prediction algorithm.  Its validity is guaranteed, and in this paper we make first steps in exploring its efficiency.'

- title: 'Class-wise confidence for debt prediction in real estate management: discussion and lessons learned from an application'
  abstract: 'The prediction of tenants likely to fall into a debt situation is a key issue for social  property owners in real estate. It is even more important for them to limit the number of people  falsely predicted to be in debt to avoid incurring unnecessary costs (in time and money), for instance  by sending agents to prevent the debt. In this paper, we adapt Mondrian conformal prediction to  control the error rate of this class, while keeping a level of confidence chosen by the social property  owner, or more generally by the user. We also test this small adaptation with different splitting  strategies and discuss the obtained results, those later showing promising results, in the sense that  they show that our approach can work, as well as pointing out and discussing difficulties, in the  sense that conformal prediction fails on some settings of particular interest to the end-user.'

  abstract: 'Six different strategies for updating split conformal predictive systems in an online  (streaming) setting are evaluated. The updating strategies vary in the extent and frequency of  retraining as well as in how training data is split into proper training and calibration sets. An  empirical evaluation is presented, considering passenger booking data from a ferry company, which  stretches over a number of years. The passenger volumes have changed drastically during 2020 due  to COVID-19 and part of the evaluation is focusing on which updating strategies work best under  such circumstances. Some strategies are observed to outperform others with respect to continuous  ranked probability score and validity, highlighting the potential value of choosing a proper strategy.'

  abstract: 'Transformer architectures have established themselves as the state-of-the-art in many  areas of natural language processing (NLP), including paraphrase detection (PD). However, they do  not include a confidence estimation for each prediction and, in many cases, the applied models are  poorly calibrated. These features are essential for numerous real-world applications. For example, in  those cases when PD is used for sensitive tasks, like plagiarism detection, hate speech recognition or  in medical NLP, mistakes might be very costly. In this work we build several variants of transformer- based conformal predictors and study their behaviour on a standard PD dataset. We show that our  models are able to produce \emph{valid} predictions while retaining the accuracy of the original  transformer-based models. The proposed technique can be extended to many more NLP problems  that are currently being investigated.'

- title: 'A non-conformity approach towards post-prostatectomy metastasis estimation using a multicentre prostate cancer database'
  abstract: 'Prostate cancer is among the most common type of cancer in men worldwide. Despite the use of clinical indicators, as part of simple rule-based strategies, stratifying patients diagnosed with prostate cancer into risk groups to reliably reflect oncological prognosis remains challenging. Machine Learning (ML) offers the possibility to develop estimation models based on routinely evaluated patient or tumor characteristics. In the present study, the estimation of metastasis in prostate patients after primary treatments (radical prostatectomy) with the aid of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Conformal Predictors (CP) was evaluated. We show that the use of ML models can complement classical statistical approaches. Moreover, the application of CP, on top of an underlying ML model, renders a probabilistic outcome that combines the simplicity of a clinical indicator with the precision of a ML approach. The TriNetX Research Network, an electronic health records database with datasets from several United States health care organizations, was used in this study. This approach can be further adapted to support clinical decision making in prostate and other types of cancer.'

- title: 'Conformal prediction and its integration within visual analytics toolbox'
  abstract: 'Conformal prediction is a machine learning approach to report on the reliability of  predictive models when applied to new cases. Machine learning techniques are gaining in  complexity, and assessing their reliability may be an essential part of explaining the inner workings  of predictive models. For practical purposes and dissemination of conformal prediction techniques,  we must include these within easily accessible toolboxes. In machine learning, a significant subset of  such toolboxes is those that use work flows and visual programming. Here, we report on an example  of such a toolbox, Python implementation of conformal prediction library, and our initial efforts and ideas to democratize conformal prediction.'

- title: 'Conformal changepoint detection in continuous model situations'
  abstract: 'Conformal prediction provides a way of testing the IID assumption, which is the standard  assumption in machine learning. A natural question is whether this way of testing is efficient. A  typical situation where the IID assumption is broken is the existence of a changepoint at which the  distribution of the data changes. We study the case of a change from one continuous distribution to  another with both distributions belonging to standard parametric families. Our conclusion is that the  conformal approach to testing the IID assumption is efficient, at least to some degree.'

- title: 'Fast conformal classification using influence functions'
  abstract: 'We use influence functions from robust statistics to speed up full conformal prediction. Traditionally, conformal prediction requires retraining multiple leave-one-out classifiers to calculate  p-values for each test point. By using influence functions, we are able to approximate this procedure  and to speed up considerably the time complexity.'
